(b) Agency personnel shall furnish to the public the information and records required to be made available by the Freedom of Information Law, as well as records otherwise available by law.

*§ 1-02 Designation of Records Access Officer.* ::


The head or governing body of each agency shall be responsible for insuring compliance with these Rules and Regulations and shall designate one or more persons as records access officer or officers to coordinate the agency's response to public requests for inspection and copying of records. The designation shall include the name, specific job title, telephone number and business address of such access officer. The designation of a records access officer or officers shall not be construed to prohibit other agency officers and employees who have been authorized previously to make records or information available to the public from continuing to do so.






*§ 1-03 Responsibilities of Records Access Officer.* ::


Each agency's records access officer shall have the following responsibilities:

(a) He shall maintain a reasonably detailed current subject matter list of all records in the possession of the agency, whether or not such records are available for inspection and copying pursuant to the Freedom of Information Law. The list shall be of sufficient detail to permit identification by the public of categories of records. The subject matter list shall be updated not less than twice per year and the date of the most recent revision of the list shall appear on its first page.

(b) He shall assist members of the public in identifying requested records.

(c) When requested records are located, he shall either make such records available for inspection or deny access to such records in whole or in part, with a written statement of the grounds for denial of access.

(d) Upon request for copies of records, he shall either arrange to make copies available on payment of or offer to pay the established fee or shall permit the requesting party to copy the records using photocopying equipment on agency premises.

(e) He shall, upon request, certify that a copy of a record is a true copy.

(f) Upon failure to locate records, he shall state in writing that the agency is not the custodian of such records or that the records cannot be found after diligent search.

(g) He shall maintain the records required to be maintained by subdivisions (b) and (f) of 43 RCNY § 1-05.






*§ 1-04 Hours and Location.* ::


(a) Each agency shall designate a location or locations where records shall be available for public inspection and copying.

(b) Each agency shall accept requests for public access to records and shall produce records during the agency's regular business hours. If an agency does not have regular business hours, it shall establish a written procedure by which a member of the public may arrange an appointment to inspect and copy records. The procedure shall specify the name, job title, telephone number and business address of the person to be contacted for the purpose of making such appointments.






*§ 1-05 Procedure for Making Requests; Responses to Requests.* ::


(a) Any request to inspect or copy records shall be made in writing and addressed to the records access officer of the appropriate agency. The request shall reasonably describe the record or records sought and shall, whenever possible, supply information regarding dates, file designations or other information which will enable the records access officer to identify the records sought.

(b) Upon receipt of a request, the records access officer shall forward the request to the division of the agency having custody of the records requested. The records access officer shall retain a file copy of each request received by him and shall maintain or cause to be maintained a record showing the date on which the request was received, the division to which it was forwarded and the date of forwarding.

(c) Within five business days of receipt of a request, the records access officer shall respond to the request:

   (1) If the agency determines that the request should be granted, the records access officer shall so notify the requesting party in a writing which states the time and place at which the requested records may be inspected and the procedures and fees for copying of records.

   (2) If the agency determines that the requested records are exempt from disclosure under the terms of the Freedom of Information Law and that the request should be denied, the records access officer shall so notify the requesting party in a writing which states the grounds for the denial.

   (3) If a request does not adequately describe the records sought, the records access officer shall notify the requesting party in writing that his request has been denied, stating the reasons why the request does not meet the requirements of this section and extending to the requesting party an opportunity to confer with the records access officer in order to attempt to reformulate the request in a manner that will enable the agency to identify the records sought.

   (4) If a requested record does not exist, has been destroyed or otherwise disposed of, or is in the possession, custody or control of another agency, the records access officer shall so notify the requesting party in writing. In the case of records which the records access officer believes to be in the possession, custody or control of another agency, he shall state in the writing the agency to which the request should be addressed.

   (5) If the agency determines that a request should be granted in part and denied in part, the records access officer shall so notify the requesting party in a writing which sets forth the information required by subparagraphs (1), (2), (3) and (4) of this subdivision (c), as applicable.

   (6) Each writing denying a request in whole or in part shall inform the requesting party of his right to appeal the determination of the agency within thirty days and shall state the name of the person or body designated in the agency to hear such appeals. Such person or body shall be identified by name, title, business address and telephone number.

(d) If, because of unusual circumstances, an agency is unable to determine within five business days whether to grant, deny or otherwise respond to a request for inspection and copying, the records access officer shall, within such five day period, acknowledge receipt of the request in writing to the requesting party, stating the approximate date, not to exceed ten business days from the date of the acknowledgement, by which a determination with respect to the request will be made. If the agency does not make a determination with respect to the request within ten business days from the date of such acknowledgement, the request may be deemed denied and an appeal may be taken to the person or body designated in the agency to hear appeals. As used in this subdivision (d), "unusual circumstances" means:

   (1) The need to search for and collect the requested records from facilities or offices that are separate from the office processing the request; or

   (2) The need to search for, collect, examine and evaluate a voluminous amount of separate and distinct records which are demanded in a single request; or

   (3) The need for consultation, which shall be conducted with all practicable speed, with another agency having a substantial interest in the determination of the request or between two or more divisions or departments of an agency having a substantial subject matter interest therein; or

   (4) Any other circumstances in which the agency is unable, by the exercise of due diligence, and acting in good faith, to comply with the time limits set forth in this sub- division.

(e) To prevent unwarranted invasions of personal privacy, an agency, in making records available for inspection and copying, may delete identifying details or may withhold records otherwise available, if deletion of identifying details is impracticable or will not, in fact, prevent an unwarranted invasion of the privacy of the person to whom the record refers. An unwarranted invasion of privacy includes, but is not limited to:

   (1) Disclosure of employment, medical or credit histories or personal references of applicants for employment; or

   (2) Disclosure of items involving the medical or personal records of a client or patient in a medical facility; or

   (3) Sale or release of lists of names and addresses if such lists would be used for commercial or fund-raising purposes; or

   (4) Disclosure of information of a personal nature when disclosure would result in economic or personal hardship to the subject party and such information is not relevant to the work of the agency requesting or maintaining it; or

   (5) Disclosure of information of a personal nature reported in confidence to an agency requesting or maintaining it and which is not relevant to the ordinary work of such agency.

(f) The records access officer shall retain a file copy of each writing granting, denying or acknowledging a request pursuant to subdivision (d) of this section and shall promptly forward to the Law Department a copy of each denial.






*§ 1-06 Procedures for Appeals.* ::


(a) The head or governing body of each agency shall hear appeals or shall designate a person or body to hear appeals (an "appeals officer") from denials of requests by a records access officer. No records access officer shall also serve as an appeals officer.

(b) When a request for inspection has been denied in writing in whole, or in part by a records access officer, the requesting party shall have thirty days after receipt of the denial within which to appeal. An appeal shall be in writing, addressed to the denying agency's appeals officer, and shall include the name of the records access officer who denied the request, the date of the request, the date of the denial, the records which were the subject of the request and the name and address of the appellant.

(c) Each appeals officer shall transmit to the Law Department and the Committee on Open Government, Department of State, 162 Washington Avenue, Albany, N.Y. 12231, copies of all appeals upon their receipt.

(d) Within ten business days from the date of actual receipt of an appeal, the appeals officer shall make a written determination either affirming or reversing the denial and shall transmit copies of his or its determination to the appellant, the Law Department and the Committee on Open Government. Determinations affirming denials shall state the grounds for withholding of the requested records and that judicial review of the denial may be obtained in a proceeding under Article 78 of the Civil Practice Law and Rules commenced within four months after determination of the appeal.






*§ 1-07 Fees.* ::


Except when a different fee is otherwise prescribed by law:

(a) Each agency shall charge a fee for copying of records equal to the actual reproduction cost, which is the average unit cost for copying of records, excluding fixed costs of the agency, such as operators' salaries; provided that, in no case shall the fee charged for copying exceed 25 cents per page for photocopies not exceeding 9 by 14 inches in size.

(b) No fee shall be charged for the search for records, the inspection of records or for any certification made pursuant to these Rules and Regulations.

(c) If an agency does not have operational photocopying equipment, the agency may either arrange for the production of photocopies outside the agency or prepare a transcript of requested records upon request. A transcript prepared by the agency may be either typed or handwritten and the persons requesting the records may be charged for the clerical time involved in making the transcript. Photocopies obtained by agencies which do not have operational photocopying equipment shall be charged to the requesting party at the same rate as that paid by the agency to the person or firm which made the photocopies.

(d) Payment for copying shall be made by check or money order payable to the City of New York and shall be made upon delivery of the copies to the person requesting them. Where the anticipated fee chargeable under this section exceeds $25, an advance deposit of 25 percent of the anticipated fee or $25, whichever is greater, may be required. Where a requesting party has previously failed to pay a fee under this section, payment of any past-due fees and an advance deposit of the full amount of the anticipated fee may be required.

Notice of any change in the above information shall be published as soon as practicable in the City Record.

(c) In addition to the matters required to be published pursuant to subdivision (b) of this section, each agency may, after consultation with the Law Department, promulgate such additional rules and regulations as may be necessary to effectuate the purpose of these Rules and Regulations; provided that any such agency rules and regulations must be consistent with the Freedom of Information Law, the applicable Rules and Regulations of the Committee on Open Government and the Rules and Regulations set forth herein. Such additional rules and regulations may provide where appropriate for the safeguarding of records during inspection and copying.

In such cases, the lead agencies shall prepare, file and circulate a Negative Declaration as prescribed in 43 RCNY § 6-07.

   (2) The final EIS shall reflect a revision and updating of the matters contained in the draft EIS in light of further review by the lead agencies, comments received and the record of the public hearing.

(b) Immediately upon the completion of a final EIS, the lead agencies shall prepare, file, circulate and make available for public inspection a Notice of Completion of a final EIS in a manner specified in 43 RCNY § 6-11(a), provided, however, that the Notice shall not contain the statement described in subparagraph (a)(1)(iv) of such section.

   (1) [Inapplicable, City Planning Rules, 43 RCNY § 5-02(a).]Except as provided in paragraph (2) of this subdivision where a final decision whether or not to carry out or approve an action is required by law to be made by any agency, such decision shall be made within 30 calendar days of the filing of a final EIS.

   (2) [Inapplicable, City Planning Rules, 43 RCNY § 5-02(a).]Where a proposed action is simultaneously subject to ULURP, the final decision whether or not to carry out or approve the action shall be made by the Board of Estimate or its successor agency within 60 calendar days of the filing of the final EIS.

(b) When an agency decides to carry out or approve an action which may have a significant effect on the environment, it shall make the following findings in a written decision:

As defined herein, MOFTB will issue permits for scouting, rigging and shooting activities. Obtaining such a permit does not obviate the need to comply with other applicable laws, rules or case law also governing such activity.

(b) Required and Optional Permits. Unless a permit is designated in these rules as an "Optional Permit", the use of the term "permit" herein shall be deemed to be a "Required Permit".

   (1) Required Permits. a.  The following activities require that a permit be obtained pursuant to this chapter: (i)  Filming, photography, production, television or radio remotes occurring on City property, as described in subdivision (a) of this section, that uses vehicles or equipment.

For purposes of this subparagraph, standing on a street, walkway of a bridge, sidewalk, or other pedestrian passageway while using a handheld device and not otherwise asserting exclusive use by any means, including physical or verbal, is not activity that requires a permit. b.  The following activities do not require that a permit be obtained pursuant to this chapter:

      (i) Filming, photography, production, television or radio remotes occurring on City property, as described in subdivision (a) of this section, involving the use of handheld devices as defined in paragraph three of subdivision (a) of 43 RCNY § 9-02, (A) if such activity does not involve the assertion by any means, including physical or verbal, of exclusive use of one or more lanes of a street or walkway of a bridge or (B) if such activity does not involve the assertion by any means, including physical or verbal, of exclusive use of more than one-half of a sidewalk or other pedestrian passageway or, in a situation in which the sidewalk or pedestrian passageway is narrower than sixteen feet, does not involve the assertion by any means, including physical or verbal, of exclusive use of the sidewalk or pedestrian passageway such that less than eight feet is otherwise available for pedestrian use. For purposes of this subparagraph, standing on a street, walkway of a bridge, sidewalk, or other pedestrian passageway while using a handheld device and not otherwise asserting exclusive use by any means, including physical or verbal, is not activity that requires a permit.

      (ii) Filming or photography of a parade, rally, protest, or demonstration except when using vehicles or equipment.

   (2) Optional Permits: Persons who are engaged in filming or still photography and are not otherwise required to obtain a permit pursuant to paragraph (1) of subdivision (b) of this section may be issued an Optional Permit. a.  Persons requesting such an Optional Permit shall provide accurate information concerning their postal address and, if available, e-mail address, telephone number and fax number; and accurate information as to the location(s) of such activities, the date(s) and time(s) during which such activities are proposed to take place. b.  MOFTB shall process Optional Permit requests in accordance with the provisions of paragraphs four, five, six, seven, eight, nine and ten of subdivision (b) of 43 RCNY § 9-02.

The use of a press pass issued by the New York City Police Department ("NYPD") in accordance with 38 RCNY Chapter 11 ("Press Credentials"), where an individual is acting in furtherance of the activity authorized by such press pass, and is engaged in filming as defined in these rules, does not require that a permit be obtained pursuant to this chapter.

(d) Authorization from other agencies: Notwithstanding the provisions of subdivision (a) of this section, scouting, rigging or shooting activities within City parks or the interiors of City buildings, bridges or tunnels require, if applicable, separate authorization from the City agency with jurisdiction over the location. The use of certain items or activities, including but not limited to animals, firearms (actual or simulated), special effects, pyrotechnics, police uniforms, police vehicles, driving shots with tow or camera rigs, and conditions that require holding of traffic may require authorization and/or assistance from the relevant government agency.

   (2) Display of permit: All permittees shall have the permit in their possession on location at the time and site of the scouting, rigging or shooting, as well as any other permits required by MOFTB or any other governmental agency, and shall make such permit available for inspection at the request of an employee of the Police Department or other government agency.

   (3) Permit restrictions: All permittees shall confine their activities to the locations and times specified on their permit. MOFTB may establish specific guidelines to address conditions that exist at certain designated locations and the use of vehicles and equipment at locations based on, among other considerations, the time of day, weather conditions, season, location, and day of the week.

   (4) Non-transferability: Required Permits and Optional Permits are not transferable.

Such activities shall include, but not be limited to, the use of stunts, helicopters, firearms or simulated firearms.

   (12) Traffic control: Where a public street is closed in connection with rigging or production activities, a 13.5-foot lane shall be kept open. Such requirement may be waived by MOFTB upon an appropriate showing of need or at the discretion of the NYPD.

   (13) Trees and plantings: Trimming, damaging, removing or cutting trees or vegetation on City property is prohibited without the prior approval of the New York City Department of Parks and Recreation.

Permittees shall be required to encourage participants in the permitted event to act in accordance with such code.

(d) Modifications to or Suspension of Required or Optional Permit.

   (1) If a permittee seeks to modify its permit, it shall submit an addendum to its original request, which will be governed by the same timetable as provided in paragraph (5) of subdivision (b) of this section.

   (2) If MOFTB determines that modifications should be made to the terms or conditions of any permit, or that a permit should be revoked, after notice and opportunity to be heard, MOFTB may do so, based upon reasons set forth in paragraph (7) of subdivision (b) of this section.

   (3) If MOFTB revokes any permit prior to the date of the scouting, rigging or shooting, the permittee may appeal the revocation, subject to the time limitations set forth in paragraph (10) of subdivision (b) of this section.

   (4) During the course of scouting, rigging or shooting, MOFTB or the NYPD may suspend any permit where public health or safety risks are found or where exigent circumstances warrant such action. Where a suspension lasting longer than six hours occurs, permittees shall be given notice and an opportunity to be heard within ten days after the suspension.






*§ 9-03 Indemnification and Insurance.* ::


(a)  By accepting a permit, a permittee agrees to protect all persons and property from damage, loss or injury arising from any of the operations performed by or on behalf of the permittee, and to indemnify and hold harmless the City, to the fullest extent permitted by law, from all claims, losses and expenses, including attorneys' fees, that may result therefrom. This indemnification requirement does not apply to any person or entity acting with an Optional Permit in accordance with 43 RCNY § 9-01(b)(2).

(b) Every holder of a Required Permit shall maintain, during the entire course of its operations, commercial general liability insurance with a limit of at least one million dollars ($1,000,000) per occurrence. Such insurance shall include a policy endorsement naming the City of New York as an additional insured with coverage at least as broad as provided by Insurance Services Office (ISO) form CG 20 26. The applicant shall provide proof of such insurance prior to the issuance of the permit by submitting a Certificate of Insurance in a form acceptable to the Commissioner certifying compliance with the foregoing requirements, accompanied by a duly executed Certification by Broker in the form required by the Commissioner. Acceptance by the Commissioner of any purported proof of insurance shall not be deemed to constitute a waiver of the permittee's obligation to ensure that insurance fully consistent with these requirements is secured and maintained, and the permittee shall be liable to the City of New York for any failure to do so. For currently enrolled film students, proof of insurance through their school and the student's current attendance shall satisfy this requirement. This insurance requirement does not apply to any person or entity holding an Optional Permit issued in accordance with 43 RCNY § 9-01(b)(4).

(c) If MOFTB determines, in light of the activity for which a permit is sought, that such activity may increase the potential for injury to individuals and/or damage to property, and that the minimum limit of insurance should be higher than one million dollars ($1,000,000) per occurrence, MOFTB shall determine what higher minimum limit is to be required and inform the applicant of such higher limit. Factors to be considered by MOFTB may include, but shall not be limited to, the number of people involved, the location of the activity and the nature of the activity. The applicant shall thereafter provide proof of such insurance in accordance with subdivision (b) of this section. If MOFTB determines in writing that a higher minimum limit is to be required, the applicant may appeal such determination by written request filed with the MOFTB appeals officer who may reverse, affirm, or modify the determination and provide a written explanation of his or her finding.

(d) (1)  MOFTB shall have the authority to waive the insurance required by subdivision (b) of this section where the applicant is able to demonstrate that such insurance cannot be obtained without imposing an unreasonable hardship on the applicant. Any request for a waiver of the insurance required by subdivision (b) of this section shall be included by the applicant in the application submitted to MOFTB under 43 RCNY § 9-02. The burden of demonstrating unreasonable hardship shall be on the applicant, and may be demonstrated by a showing, for example, that the cost of obtaining insurance for the permitted activity exceeds twenty-five percent (25%) of the applicant's budget for such activity that is the subject of the application. MOFTB shall take into consideration the applicant's projections of budget as well as the budget projections for comparable productions of similar size and duration in determining whether the cost of obtaining insurance exceeds twenty-five percent (25%) of the budget. MOFTB may also take into consideration its determination that the permitted activity may increase the potential for injury to individuals and/or damage to property. In the event that MOFTB denies a waiver of the insurance requirement, the applicant may thereafter respond to the denial and appeal such denial pursuant to the provisions of 43 RCNY § 9-02.

   (2) If an applicant requests and is granted a waiver of the insurance required by subdivision (b) of this section because it would impose an unreasonable hardship, such applicant shall be deemed to qualify for a waiver of the $300.00 fee required by subparagraph b of paragraph (1) of subdivision (b) of 43 RCNY § 9-02 in the event such applicant makes a request for a waiver of the $300.00 fee.

If any storage tank(s) subject to regulation pursuant to 6 NYCRR parts 596, 597, 598, 599, 610, 612, 613, or 614 is discovered and found not to be registered or not to be operated in accordance with the applicable regulatory requirements, such tank(s) shall be registered and either closed in accordance with regulatory requirements or brought into compliance with the applicable regulatory requirements.

   2. Where petroleum storage tanks or chemical storage tanks are discovered on site during the course of the remedial program, such tanks shall be addressed pursuant to state and federal law and in programs designed for that purpose.

   3. Where any contaminant is found to be stored on the site in containment vessels, such as storage tanks, drums, or transformers, such contaminants shall be addressed pursuant to state and federal law and in programs designed for that purpose.

c. Source removal and control measures. The following is the hierarchy of source removal and control measures that are to be used to remediate a site, ranked from most preferable to least preferable:

   1. Removal and/or treatment. All sources, concentrated solid or semi-solid hazardous substances, dense non-aqueous phase liquid, light non-aqueous phase liquid and/or grossly contaminated media shall be removed and/or treated; provided however, that if the removal and/or treatment of all such contamination is not feasible, such contamination shall be removed or treated to the greatest extent feasible.

   2. Containment. Any source remaining following removal and or treatment pursuant to this subdivision shall be contained; provided however, that if full containment is not feasible, such source shall be contained to the greatest extent feasible.

   3. Elimination of exposure. Exposure to any source remaining following removal, treatment and/or containment pursuant to this subdivision shall be eliminated through additional measures, including but not limited to, as applicable, the timely and sustained provision of alternative water supplies and the elimination of volatilization into buildings; provided however, that if such elimination is not feasible such exposure shall be eliminated to the greatest extent feasible.

   4. Treatment of source at the point of exposure. Treatment of the exposure resulting from a source of environmental contamination at the point of exposure, including but not limited to, as applicable, wellhead treatment or the management of volatile contamination within buildings, shall be considered as a measure of last resort.

d. Groundwater protection and control measures. The remedial program shall satisfy the requirements for groundwater contamination of 6 NYCRR part 375 and shall be consistent with any agreement between the office and a state and/or federal agency.

e. Scope of the investigation.

   1. The goals of a remedial investigation include, but are not limited to, the following:

      A. delineation of the areal and vertical extent of the contamination at, and emanating from, all media at the site and the nature of that contamination;

      B. characterization of the surface and subsurface characteristics of the site, including topography, surface drainage, stratigraphy, depth to groundwater, any aquifers that have been impacted or have the potential to be impacted, and proximity to tidal surface waterbodies;

      C. identification of the sources of contamination, the migration pathways and actual or potential receptors of contaminants;

      D. evaluation of actual and potential threats to public health and the environment; and

      E. production of data of sufficient quantity and quality to support the necessity for, and the proposed extent of, remediation and to support the evaluation of proposed remedial alternatives.

   2. Such investigation shall emphasize data collection, sampling and monitoring, as necessary, and shall include but not be limited to:

      A. characterization of site geologic and hydrogeologic conditions, including groundwater flow, contaminant movement, and the characteristics of the groundwater system;

      B. assessment of the existing and potential impact of groundwater contamination on water supply wells in New York city, including those for drinking water supply, surface water quality, air quality, and indoor air quality;

      C. sampling and analysis necessary to gather sufficient information to evaluate human and environmental exposure pathways, as well as any actual or potential adverse effects due to site contamination; and

      D. delineation of the nature and extent of contamination sufficient to determine the necessity for and the proposed extent of remediation, in order to support the development and evaluation of proposed alternatives in the remedy selection process.

   3. Historical data may be submitted in lieu of collecting new data or to supplement new data, provided that the appropriate quality assurance requirements are met and that the data were collected in a manner consistent with appropriate sampling protocols. All information relevant to the ongoing work must be referenced in the investigation reports, including sampling protocols employed.

   4. On-site contamination. Enrollees must fully investigate and characterize the nature and extent of contamination on the qualified local brownfield site.

   5. Off-site contamination. Responsibility for off-site contamination is determined by the enrollee's status as follows:

      A. A volunteer shall perform a qualitative exposure assessment of the contamination that has migrated from the site consistent with § 27-1415(2)(b) of the New York state environmental conservation law and state guidance document DER-10, issued by the division of environmental remediation of the New York state department of environmental conservation. For sites being addressed by a volunteer, the volunteer has no obligation to implement a remedy to address an off-site exposure identified by this assessment.

      B. A participant shall fully investigate and characterize the nature and extent of contamination that has migrated or emanated from the site to off-site locations.

   6. The remedial investigation report must demonstrate whether conditions at the site without remediation meet the applicable unrestricted use soil cleanup objectives set forth in the table in 6 NYCRR § 375-6.8(a).

   7. Where the applicable unrestricted use soil cleanup objectives set forth in the table in 6 NYCRR § 375-6.8(a) will not be achieved, any determination that the requirements of the brownfield cleanup program have been met without the need for remediation shall be supported by a remedial alternatives analysis.

f. Remedial action selection.

   1. Remedial actions shall be selected upon consideration of the following ten factors:

      A. Overall protectiveness of the public health and the environment.

      B. Standards and criteria. The remedial actions shall:

         i. conform to standards and criteria that are generally applicable, consistently applied, and officially promulgated; that are directly applicable; or that are not directly applicable but are relevant and appropriate, unless good cause exists to dispense with conformity. Good cause exists if any of the following is present: (a) the proposed action is only part of a complete program or project that will conform to such standard or criterion upon completion; (b) conformity to such standard or criterion will result in greater risk to the public health or to the environment than alternatives; (c) conformity to such standard or criterion is technically impracticable from an engineering or scientific perspective; or (d) the program or project will attain a level of performance that is equivalent to that required by the standard or criterion through the use of another method or approach.

      C. Long-term effectiveness and permanence: a program or project that achieves a complete and permanent cleanup of the site is preferred over a program or project that does not do so.

      D. Reduction in toxicity, mobility or volume of contamination through treatment: a program or project that permanently and significantly reduces the toxicity, mobility or volume of contamination is to be preferred over a program or project that does not do so. The following is the hierarchy of technologies and factors to be considered in selecting a remedial action, ranked from the most preferable to the least preferable:

         i. destruction of contamination, on-site or off-site;

         ii. separation or treatment of contamination, on-site or off-site;

         iii. solidification or chemical fixation of contamination, on-site or off-site; and

         iv. control and isolation of contamination, on-site or off-site.

      E. Short-term impacts and effectiveness.

      F. Ability to be implemented.

      G. Cost-effectiveness, including capital costs and annual site maintenance plan costs.

      H. Community acceptance.

      I. Land uses, provided that the office determines that there is reasonable certainty associated with such uses. In assessing reasonable certainty, the office shall consider:

         i. the current, intended, and reasonably anticipated future land uses of the site and its surroundings in the selection of the remedy for soil remediation;

         ii. the office's determination on the use of the site shall be in accordance with subdivision k of this section; and

         iii. the reasonably anticipated future use of the site and its surroundings, which shall be documented in the analysis of alternatives, taking into consideration factors including, but not limited to, the following:

            (a) current use and historical and/or recent development patterns;

            (b) applicable zoning laws and maps;

            (c) brownfield opportunity areas pursuant to § 970-r of the New York state general municipal law;

            (d) applicable comprehensive community master plans, local waterfront revitalization plans as provided for in article forty-two of the New York state executive law, or any other applicable land use plan formally adopted by the city of New York;

            (e) proximity to real property currently used for residential use, schools and childcare facilities, and to commercial, industrial, agricultural, and/or recreational areas;

            (f) any written or oral comments on the proposed use that are submitted by members of the public through activities performed under the citizen participation plan pursuant to 43 RCNY § 43-1409(c);

            (g) environmental justice impacts, which for purposes of this section include the extent to which the proposed use may reasonably be expected to cause or increase a disproportionate burden on the community in which the site is located, including low-income minority communities, or to result in a disproportionate concentration of commercial or industrial uses in what has historically been a mixed use or residential community;

            (h) federal or state land use designations;

            (i) population growth patterns and projections;

            (j) accessibility to existing infrastructure;

            (k) proximity of the site to important cultural resources, including federal or state historic or heritage sites or Native American religious sites;

            (l) natural resources, including proximity of the site to important federal, state, or city natural resources, including waterways, wildlife refuges, wetlands, or critical habitats of endangered or threatened species;

            (m) potential vulnerability of groundwater to contamination that might emanate from the site, including proximity to wellhead protection and groundwater recharge areas and other areas identified by the state's comprehensive groundwater remediation and protection program established in title thirty-one of article fifteen of the New York state environmental conservation law;

            (n) proximity to flood plains;

            (o) geography and geology; and

            (p) current institutional controls applicable to the site.

      J. Sustainability of the remedy.

   2. Enrollees shall, based upon the characterization of the nature and extent of contamination on-site and qualitative exposure assessment, propose a remedy for the contamination present on the site and address further contaminant migration from the site.

   3. Participants shall also, based upon the characterization of the nature and extent of contamination that has migrated from the site, propose a remedy which addresses the off-site contamination.

   4. The office shall approve, a remedy for a site after consideration of an alternatives analysis, including an evaluation consistent with subdivision i of this section presented in a site specific remedial action work plan.

   5. Selection of a remedial action. The enrollee may select the remedial action from an office-approved alternatives analysis.

g. Application of soil cleanup objectives.

   1. General. The office may approve a remedial program that utilizes different tracks and soil cleanup objectives for different uses between different areas of a site, provided that such areas can be defined and described in the declaration of covenants and restrictions and that the necessary institutional and engineering controls can be effectively imposed, implemented, operated, monitored, and maintained in accordance with the office-approved site management plan.

   2. Cleanup objectives for other media. The enrollee shall evaluate exposure to public health and the environment resulting from contamination in all other environmental media and shall propose cleanup objectives to eliminate or mitigate the exposure. The enrollee shall include any cleanup objectives approved by the office for other media in the alternatives analysis to ensure that the remedial program meets the requirements of this subdivision and subdivision i of this section.

h. Cleanup tracks. For sites or portions of sites where the office has determined that remediation is needed to meet the remedial program requirements, each remedial alternative that is developed and evaluated shall, in addition to all other requirements in this subdivision and subdivision i of this section, conform to the requirements of one of the following cleanup tracks defined below:

   1. Track one: unrestricted use. The following provisions apply to a site, or portion thereof, being remediated pursuant to track one:

      A. The remedial program shall achieve a cleanup level that will allow the site to be used for any purpose without any restrictions on the use of the site as described in paragraph one of subdivision k of this section.

      B. The soil component of the remedial program shall achieve the unrestricted soil cleanup objectives pursuant to the table in 6 NYCRR § 375-6.8(a) for all soils above bedrock.

      C. The remedial program shall not include the use of long-term institutional or engineering controls; provided, however, that a restriction on groundwater use may be included as a component of the remedial program if the enrollee:

         i. is a volunteer; and

         ii. has demonstrated to the office's satisfaction that there has been a bulk reduction in groundwater contamination to asymptotic levels.

      D. The remedial program may include the short-term employment of institutional or engineering controls provided that:

         i. the remedial program includes an active treatment system, either ex-situ or in-situ, that will operate for, or require, no more than five years to meet the applicable contaminant-specific soil cleanup objectives or remedial goals established for contaminated media other than soils;

         ii. the remedial program requires the institutional control to assure the operation and integrity of the remedy, as well as to address potential human health exposures during this period; and

         iii. the remedial program includes a provision for the enrollee to implement an alternative remedy to meet the soil cleanup objectives in the event that the short-term institutional period is exceeded.

   2. Track two: Restricted use with generic soil cleanup objectives. The following provisions apply to a site, or portion thereof, being remediated pursuant to track two:

      A. The remedial program may provide for the restriction of the use of the site as described in paragraph two of subdivision k of this section.

      B. The soil component of the remedial program shall achieve the lowest of the three applicable contaminant-specific soil cleanup objectives for all soils above bedrock, as set forth in 6 NYCRR §§ 375-6.4, 375-6.5 and 375-6.6, except as provided in subparagraph C below.

      C. The requirement to achieve contaminant-specific soil cleanup objectives pursuant to the table in 6 NYCRR § 375-6.8(b) for all soils above bedrock shall not apply to soils at a depth greater than fifteen feet below ground surface, provided that:

         i. the soils below fifteen feet do not represent a source of contamination;

         ii. the declaration of covenants and restrictions for the site requires that any contaminated soils remaining at depth will be managed along with other site soils, pursuant to a site management plan;

         iii. off-site groundwater affected by on-site contamination does not exceed standards; and

         iv. on-site groundwater use is restricted. If the office determines that a waterfront site that is proposed for industrial use is susceptible to significant coastal erosion from severe storm events, the soil component of the remedial program must achieve the contaminant-specific soil cleanup objectives set forth in 6 NYCRR § 375-6.4(b)(3).

      D. The remedial program shall not use long-term institutional or engineering controls to achieve the restricted soil cleanup objectives. The use of short-term institutional or engineering controls is permitted, provided that:

         i. the remedial program includes an active treatment system, either ex-situ or in-situ, that will operate for, or require, no more than five years to meet the applicable contaminant-specific soil cleanup objectives or remedial goals established;

         ii. the remedial program requires the institutional control to assure the operation and integrity of the remedy, as well as to address potential human health exposures during this period; and

         iii. the remedial program includes a provision for the enrollee to implement an alternative remedy to meet the soil cleanup objectives in the event that the short-term institutional period is exceeded.

      E. The remedial program may include the use of long-term institutional or engineering controls to address contamination related to other media including, but not limited to, groundwater and soil vapor.

   3. Track three: Restricted use with modified soil cleanup objectives. The remedial program for a site being remediated pursuant to track three shall satisfy the provisions for a track two remedial program; provided, however, that the office may approve the modification of one or more of the contaminant-specific soil cleanup objectives set forth in the table in 6 NYCRR § 375-6.8(b) based upon site-specific data. Any such modification shall be performed in accordance with 6 NYCRR § 375-6.9 and in consultation with the New York state department of environmental conservation and/or the New York state department of health.

   4. Track four: Restricted use with site-specific soil cleanup objectives. The following provisions apply to a site, or portion thereof, being remediated pursuant to track four:

      A. In developing the site-specific soil cleanup objectives, the enrollee may, solely or in combination:

         i. use the soil cleanup objectives, as set forth in 6 NYCRR subpart 375-6, except if the office determines that a waterfront site that is proposed for industrial use is susceptible to significant coastal erosion from severe storm events, the enrollee may, solely or in combination, use the soil cleanup objectives as set forth in 6 NYCRR § 375-6.4(b)(1)-(3);

         ii. develop or modify site specific soil cleanup objectives, as set forth at 6 NYCRR § 375-6.9; or

         iii. propose site-specific soil cleanup objectives that are protective of public health and the environment.

      B. The remedial program may include the use of long-term institutional or engineering controls to remediate all media.

      C. Exposed surface soils in a track four remedy shall be remediated as follows:

         i. for residential use:

            (a) the top two feet of all exposed surface soils that are not otherwise covered by the components of the development of the site (such as buildings or pavement) shall not exceed the applicable contaminant-specific soil cleanup objectives pursuant to subparagraph B of paragraph two of this subdivision; and

            (b) where it is necessary to utilize off-site soil to achieve this requirement, the soil brought to the site shall satisfy the requirements of 6 NYCRR § 375-6.7(d).

         ii. for commercial use:

            (a) the top one foot of all exposed surface soils that are not otherwise covered by the components of the development of the site (such as buildings or pavement) shall not exceed the applicable contaminant-specific soil cleanup objectives pursuant to subparagraph B of paragraph two of this subdivision; and

            (b) where it is necessary to utilize off-site soil to achieve this requirement, the soil brought to the site shall satisfy the requirements of 6 NYCRR § 375-6.7(d).

         iii. for industrial use:

            (a) the top one foot of all exposed surface soils that are not otherwise covered by the components of the development of the site (such as buildings or pavement) shall not exceed the applicable contaminant-specific soil cleanup objectives pursuant to subparagraph B of paragraph two of this subdivision; and

            (b) where it is necessary to utilize off-site soil to achieve this requirement, the soil brought to the site shall satisfy the requirements of 6 NYCRR § 375-6.7(d).

   5. All tracks. For remedial programs under all tracks, the threat to public health and the environment resulting from contamination in environmental media other than soil shall be evaluated in the development of remedial alternatives and addressed in the alternatives analysis to ensure that the remedial program meets the requirements of this subchapter.

i. Alternatives analysis.

   1. An alternatives analysis evaluates each remedial alternative developed for a qualified local brownfield site, using the selection factors set forth in subdivision f of this section.

   2. The enrollee shall prepare an alternatives analysis for each site, or operable unit of a site, unless the remedy proposed meets the requirements of track one.

   3. Contents of an alternatives analysis. Each alternatives analysis shall include, but is not limited to, the following:

      A. A description of each alternative evaluated in the analysis. The enrollee shall develop and evaluate alternatives that address:

         i. on-site contamination if the enrollee is a volunteer; or

         ii. on-site and off-site contamination if the enrollee is a participant.

      B. A discussion of how each alternative would achieve the requirements of the remedial program, including the track-specific requirements.

      C. An analysis of each alternative against the remedy selection factors set forth in subdivision f of this section, followed by a comparison of this analysis to any other alternatives under consideration.

      D. An evaluation of the reliability and viability of the long-term implementation, maintenance, monitoring, and enforcement of any proposed institutional or engineering controls set forth in subdivision l of this section.

      E. If applicable, an evaluation of feasible remedial alternatives that can achieve groundwater plume stabilization in accordance with subdivision d of this section.

      F. An identification of the alternative preferred by the enrollee.

      G. A summary of the proposed remedy and basis for concluding that the proposed remedy represents the best alternative among those considered.

      H. Any other information as required by the office.

   4. Alternatives to be evaluated. The enrollee shall develop the alternatives analysis in consultation with the office. The alternatives analysis shall consider at least one unrestricted alternative that meets the requirements of track one. The office may request that the alternatives analysis also shall consider at least one alternative that meets the requirements of track two.

   5. Plume stabilization. In developing remedies for a site where plume stabilization is a necessary component of the remedy, in accordance with subparagraph C of paragraph one of subdivision d of this section, and where such plume is emanating from an on-site source:

      A. A participant shall address, to the extent feasible, the on-site and off-site plume. This requirement includes such actions to maintain and monitor any stabilization of the plume.

      B. A volunteer shall address, to the extent feasible, the on-site plume and prevent or mitigate the further migration of any plume off-site at the site boundary. This requirement includes actions to maintain and monitor any stabilization of the plume.

j. Remedial action work plan.

   1. The office shall issue a decision document establishing the remedy for a site. The remedial action work plan shall implement the decision document.

   2. The remedial action work plan shall provide for the development and implementation of the remedial program for:

      A. on-site contamination if the enrollee is a volunteer; or

      B. on-site and off-site contamination if the enrollee is a participant.

   3. A remedial action work plan shall include at a minimum:

      A. a summary of the site history and the nature and extent of contamination;

      B. remedial action objectives;

      C. a summary of the current, intended, and reasonably anticipated future uses of the site;

      D. identification of the cleanup track to be used for remediation of the site as provided in subdivision h of this section;

      E. identification and evaluation of any and all institutional or engineering controls to be employed as part of the site remedy as required pursuant to subdivision l of this section, if applicable, and subparagraph D of paragraph three of subdivision i of this section;

      F. an alternatives analysis as set forth in subdivision i of this section; and

      G. any other information as required by the office.

   4. A remedial action work plan shall serve as the remedial design document for a site and shall:

      A. be certified by a professional engineer for all engineering design and construction components;

      B. include, but not be limited to, the following:

         i. plans and specifications sufficient to construct the remedy;

         ii. a site health and safety plan;

         iii. a community air monitoring plan and community protection statement;

         iv. quality assurance and quality control plans for sampling, analysis, and construction; and

         v. where required by the office, a sustainability statement.

      C. include a program design for site management, if the remedy includes any institutional or engineering controls.

k. Use of a site. A site or a portion of a site may be used for either unrestricted or restricted use.

   1. "Unrestricted use" means a lawful use without imposed restrictions, such as a declaration of covenants and restrictions or other land use controls. In reviewing applications for unrestricted use, the Office may consider area-wide or city-wide use restrictions.

   2. "Restricted use" means a use with imposed restrictions, such as a declaration of covenants and restrictions. The imposed restrictions are part of the remedy selected for the site and are stipulated in a site management plan. The imposed restrictions rely on institutional controls or engineering controls to manage remaining exposure to contamination at a site. Restricted uses include:

      A. "Residential use" is the land use category that allows a site to be used for any use other than raising livestock or producing animal products for human consumption. Restrictions on the use of groundwater are allowed, but no other institutional or engineering controls are allowed with respect to the residential use soil cleanup objectives. When considering the applicability of this land use category, the office shall consider the ability to implement the proposed site management plan and its implementation program, including the need for common ownership of the site in order to implement the site management plan.

      B. "Restricted-residential use" is the land use category that shall only be considered when there is common ownership or a single owner/managing entity of the site. When considering the applicability of this land use category, the Office shall consider the ability to implement the proposed site management plan and its implementation program. Restricted-residential use:

         i. shall, at a minimum, include restrictions that prohibit: (a) any vegetable gardens on a site, where such gardens in the restricted-residential soil are feasible and reasonably anticipated; and (b) single family housing.

         ii. includes active recreational uses, which are public uses with a reasonable potential for soil contact.

      C. "Commercial use" is the land use category that shall only be considered for the primary purpose of buying, selling or trading of merchandise or services at street grade or below street grade. Commercial use includes passive recreational uses, which are public uses with limited potential for soil contact.

      D. "Industrial use," also known as manufacturing use, is the land use category that shall only be considered for the primary purpose of manufacturing, production, fabrication or assembly processes and ancillary services. Industrial use does not include any recreational component.

   3. The Office may approve a remedial program that relies upon no restrictions on use (unrestricted use) or on a range of restrictions on use (restricted uses). The Office may also consider area-wide or city-wide restrictions on use in approval of a remedial program. The following hierarchy represents the range from a less restrictive to a more restrictive land use:

      A. residential;

      B. restricted-residential;

      C. commercial; and

      D. industrial.

   4. The office's determination of the allowable use of a site as part of a remedial program:

      A. is not a determination by the office relative to a specific future use;

      B. shall be the least restrictive use of the site, as set forth in paragraph three of this subdivision, allowed by such remedial program and permits more restrictive uses to occur on the site (for example, a site cleanup to a commercial use would also be protective of industrial use); and

      C. may disregard the enrollee's proposed use and approve a remedy upon a use that is consistent with existing zoning laws or maps.

   5. The office shall not approve a proposed remedial program when the proposed use of the site does not conform with applicable zoning laws or maps or the reasonably anticipated future use of the site as determined by the office, unless:

      A. the proposed use is based on a cleanup level that would allow a less restrictive use of the site than would be allowed based upon current zoning laws or maps (for example, the office may approve a cleanup to residential levels for a property which is zoned for commercial use); or

      B. it can be shown to the office's satisfaction that zoning changes are or will be sought, in which event the office shall conditionally approve the remedy but shall not issue a notice of completion for such use until such use is consistent with existing zoning laws or maps. In this instance, a notice of completion may be issued for a more restrictive use consistent with the zoning, and reissued by the office for the less restrictive use once it is consistent with the zoning.

   6. For purposes of determining the appropriate land use category, the office shall consider the nature of the uses and the activities that are occurring, or may occur, at the site: A. on the ground level and below ground level of any structure. The office may also consider uses above ground level; or

      B. on the surrounding land.

l. Institutional controls, engineering controls, and restrictive declarations.

   1. Institutional and engineering controls. Institutional and/or engineering controls may be included in a remedial action work plan provided that they are evaluated in the alternatives analysis. A remedy that includes institutional controls and/or engineering controls shall include the following:

      A. a complete description of any use restrictions and/or any other institutional controls, their role in achieving the remedial objectives of the remedy, and the mechanisms that will be used to implement, maintain, monitor, report, and enforce such restrictions and controls;

      B. a complete description of any engineering controls and any site management plan requirements, including the mechanisms that will be used to continually implement, maintain, monitor, report, and enforce such controls and requirements;

      C. an evaluation of the reliability and viability of the long-term implementation, maintenance, monitoring, reporting, and enforcement of any proposed institutional or engineering controls and an analysis of the costs of implementing, maintaining, monitoring, reporting, and enforcing such controls, including costs that may be borne by the state or city;

      D. an analysis sufficient to support a conclusion that effective implementation, maintenance, monitoring, reporting, funding and enforcement of institutional and/or engineering controls can be reasonably expected;

      E. where required by the office, financial assurance, in accordance with 43 RCNY § 43-1410(b), to ensure the long term implementation, maintenance, monitoring, reporting, and enforcement of any such controls; and

      F. any engineering control must be used in conjunction with institutional controls to ensure the continued integrity of such engineering control.

   2. Declaration of covenants and restrictions.

      A. Any site-specific use restrictions, any other institutional controls, any engineering controls and/or any site management requirements applicable to the qualified local brownfield site shall be contained in a declaration of covenants and restrictions, which shall be:

         i. created and recorded, prior to the issuance of the notice of completion, in the recording office for the borough(s) where any portion of the site is located, or in the case of a hazardous materials e-designation, in the official records of the New York city department of buildings; and

         ii. in a form and manner as prescribed by the director.

      B. The office shall notify the department of buildings and other relevant agencies of the declaration of covenants and restrictions.

      C. Agents, employees, or other representatives of the city may enter and inspect the property restricted by a declaration of covenants and restrictions with reasonable prior notice to the property owner, to assure compliance with the restrictions identified by the declaration of covenants and restrictions.

   3. Institutional control/engineering control certification.

      A. The enrollee or owner at a site at which institutional or engineering controls are employed as part of a remedy, shall annually submit, unless an alternate certification period is provided in writing by the office, a written certification:

         i. by a professional engineer for all active remedial systems;

         ii. by a professional engineer or a qualified environmental professional for all mitigation or passive remedial systems; or

         iii. where the only control is an institutional control on the use of the property or a physical barrier or cover, the written certification may be made by the property owner.

      B. The certification shall be included in a report summarizing the site management effort for the certification period, in such form and manner as the office may require, and shall certify that:

         i. the inspection of the site to confirm the effectiveness of the institutional and engineering controls required by the remedial program was performed under the direction of the party making the certification;

         ii. the institutional controls and/or engineering controls employed at such site: (a) are in-place; and (b) are in the office-approved format.

         iii. nothing has occurred that would impair the ability of such controls to protect the public health and environment;

         iv. the enrollee or owner will continue to allow access to such real property to representatives of the office to evaluate the continued maintenance of such controls;

         v. nothing has occurred that would constitute a violation or failure to comply with any site management plan for such controls;

         vi. the report and all attachments were prepared under the direction of, and reviewed by, the party making the certification;

         vii. to the best of his/her knowledge and belief, the work and conclusions described in the certification are in accordance with the requirements of the site remedial program and generally accepted science and engineering practices; and

         viii. the information presented is accurate and complete.

   1. A property shall be located within the city of New York. However, projects that are not supported by the New York city department of housing preservation and development, or the New York city housing development corporation for affordable and /or supportive housing, or are not supported by the New York city economic development corporation for industrial or manufacturing, or are not substantially supported by the City for other projects in Manhattan at or south of 96th Street or projects larger than 100,000 square feet that are not preferred community development projects are ineligible for pre-enrollment and enrollment grants, except for brownfield green job training grants and green property certification grants. Contiguous properties enrolled by the same developer are eligible for only one grant award.

   2. A property shall meet the definition of a qualifying brownfield property for the type of grant(s) sought.

   3. A property admitted to the brownfield cleanup program administered by the New York state department of environmental conservation is ineligible for a grant except for a City pre-enrollment grant as defined in 43 RCNY § 43-1417(b)(3), a City enrollment grant as defined in 43 RCNY § 43-1417(b)(7), a brownfield green job training grant as defined in 43 RCNY § 43-1417(b)(5), and a green property certification grant, as defined in 43 RCNY § 43-1417(b)(6).
