Title 31: Mayor&apos;s Office of Homelessness and Single Room Occupancy
===================================================

Chapter 1: Eligibility of Homeless Families and Individuals To Rent City-Owned Apartment
--------------------------------------------------



*§ 1-01 Eligibility.* ::


(a) Apartments in City-owned buildings may be viewed and rented by families who have been homeless for at least twelve months.

(b) Priority for such housing among eligible families shall be based on length of stay in City-sponsored emergency housing. Families with a longer cumulative stay in such housing shall have a priority for viewing and renting City-owned apartments. In determining the length of stay for this purpose, stays in Tier I or Tier II shelters, Family Centers, hotels (when family has been in continuous receipt of hotel/motel allowance), or City sponsored battered women's programs shall be cumulated. Where a family has a break in residence in excess of 30 days their length of stay should be calculated from the first day of their return to any of the above facilities.

(c) Exceptions to the policy stated in paragraphs (a) and (b) may be granted in exigent circumstances by the Mayor's office or Homelessness and SRO Housing Services. An exception may be granted only if residence in any facility listed in paragraph (b) would pose a serious and present danger to the life, safety or health of a family member and there is no alternative housing available for the family.

(d) Smaller apartments suitable for only single individuals may be assigned to appropriate homeless individuals. They shall be assigned to appropriate homeless individuals:

   (1) to foster and encourage independence by shelter residents participating in employment programs, and

   (2) to address the special medical needs of an individual who may benefit from housing outside of the shelter system, as determined by ERA in conjunction with a designee of the Mayor's Office on Homelessness and SRO Housing Services.




Chapter 2: Single Adult Homeless Shelter
--------------------------------------------------



*§ 2-01 Single Adult Permanent Housing Referral Criteria.* ::


(a)  Homeless shelters for single adults may not refer clients to permanent housing in buildings that meet one or more of the following criteria:

   (1) Buildings that appear on the New York State Department of Health (DOH) Referral Suspension List or on the DOH Uncertified Facilities List, as posted on the DOH website, when a client's exit from shelter is being planned, or when the shelter otherwise considers referring a client to the address.

   (2) Buildings that have active vacate orders listed by the NYC Department of Buildings (DOB), Department of Housing Preservation and Development (HPD) and/or the Fire Department (FDNY) on their respective websites when a client's exit from shelter is being planned, or when the shelter otherwise considers referring a client to the address.

   (3) Buildings against which HPD has pending litigation, or with one or more Hazard Class "I" violations as reflected in the HPD "Complaint, Violations and Registration Information" database, when a client's exit from shelter is being planned, or when the shelter otherwise considers referring a client to the address, or buildings that at such time are identified on the HPD website as enrolled in the HPD Alternative Enforcement Program (AEP) established by the New York Administrative Code § 27-2153.

   (4) Buildings with one or more complaints posted on the DOB website (Buildings Information System or BIS) within the four years preceding the time when a client's exit from shelter is being planned, or when the shelter otherwise considers referring a client to the address, that meet both criteria (i) and (ii) below:

      (i) Coded as one or more of the following Complaint Categories:

      (ii) Complaint Disposition Codes that are blank in BIS or are A1 through A9 (violations or summons served) or are C1 through C4 (failure to gain access/access denied).

(b) Referrals by shelters to housing that meets one or more of the criteria set forth in subdivision (a) of this section will be penalized through the Performance Incentive Program, as set forth in the provider's contract with DHS.

(c) A shelter provider may not stop a client from choosing to exit shelter to housing that meets one or more of the criteria set forth in subdivision (a) of this section. Should a client make such a choice, the shelter staff must inform the client that the housing option he or she has chosen fails to meet the minimum standards outlined by DHS. Shelter staff must document this conversation in the client's case record.

(d) Using the criteria set forth in subdivision (a) of this section, shelter providers must evaluate a housing option provided by a potential landlord or agent before that landlord or agent presents that housing option to clients within a homeless shelter for single adults. If a shelter provider discovers that a housing option is found to meet one or more of the criteria set forth in subdivision (a) of this section, the shelter provider must prohibit the landlord or agent from presenting this housing option to clients in the shelter.

(e) Should a client view a housing option provided by a potential landlord or agent and believe that it meets one or more of the criteria set forth in subdivision (a) of this section, the shelter provider must offer to assist the client in making a complaint to the 311 citizen service center. The shelter provider must provide the client with access to a telephone if the client does not have one available. If the client refuses to accept the housing option based on his/her report of a condition that would make the housing option inappropriate under such criteria, the shelter provider must not make the referral. If an inspection conducted by the Department of Buildings and/or Department of Housing Preservation and Development subsequent to a 311 complaint determines that the housing option does not meet any of the criteria set forth in subdivision (a) of this section, the shelter provider may make the referral. In the event a client refuses the referred housing option, the reason(s) for the refusal must be documented in the client's case record.

(f) Shelter providers must distribute to all clients in shelter a plain language document that describes the conditions that preclude a referral to a housing option meeting one or more of the criteria set forth in subdivision (a) of this section and contains information about how to contact the Department of Buildings and the 311 citizen service center.




Chapter 3: Single Adult Homeless Shelter
--------------------------------------------------



*§ 3-01 Single Adult Resource Assessment.* ::


(a) Definitions.

   (1) Official shelter: The single adult shelter to which an adult shelter client has been assigned, following intake and assessment.

   (2) Extended absence: An exit from the single adult shelter system lasting at least 30 consecutive days.

   (3) Returnee: An adult shelter client who returns to a single adult shelter after an extended absence and within 365 days.

   (4) Single Adult Resource Assessment: An assessment to identify alternative housing options available to a Returnee and to connect a Returnee to resources or benefits to avoid re-entry into shelter.

   (5) Diversion services: Services offered at a single adult intake center directed at finding non-shelter housing alternatives and resources.

   (6) Diversion office: An office located at a single adult intake center that provides diversion services.

(b) Upon a Returnee's return to the adult shelter system, shelter staff must determine whether, based on the entirety of the Returnee's circumstances, the Returnee will return to his or her official shelter or be referred to a diversion office for a Single Adult Resource Assessment. Factors whose presence would allow the Returnee to return to his or her official shelter and not be referred for a Single Adult Resource Assessment include but are not limited to:

   (1) The Returnee has a mental or physical disability;

   (2) Either the Returnee, or the primary tenant of the residence where the Returnee had been living prior to returning to shelter, has been evicted;

   (3) A vacate order has been issued for the residence where the Returnee had been living during his or her extended absence;

   (4) The Returnee was recently discharged from a prison, hospital, residential treatment facility, or other institution;

   (5) The Returnee is a victim of domestic violence; or

   (6) The Returnee has been living on the street.

If one or more of these factors are present, the Returnee must be assigned a bed at his or her official shelter. If a bed at the official shelter is unavailable, the Returnee must be given alternate placement until a bed at the official shelter becomes available. If none of these factors are present, shelter staff must refer the Returnee to a diversion office for a Single Adult Resource Assessment.

(c) If shelter staff determines that the Returnee must be referred for a Single Adult Resource Assessment, the Returnee must appear in person at a diversion office. DHS must provide transportation services or MetroCards to transport the Returnee to a diversion office. No Returnee will be transported at a time, or in a manner, that would be unsafe for the Returnee due to illness or intoxication.

(d) Single Adult Resource Assessment.

   (1) Upon the Returnee's arrival at a diversion office during regular business hours for conducting Single Adult Resource Assessments, diversion staff must conduct a Single Adult Resource Assessment with the Returnee.

   (2) If the Returnee arrives at a diversion office after regular business hours for conducting Single Adult Resource Assessments, he or she must be temporarily assigned a bed and provided meals and shower facilities at the diversion office until a Single Adult Resource Assessment can be conducted the next business day.

(e) Following the Single Adult Resource Assessment, if the Returnee does not have an alternative housing option, or has such an option but does not wish to return to or utilize the option, he or she must be referred back to his or her official shelter as soon as a bed is available. If a bed at the official shelter is unavailable, the Returnee must be given alternate placement until a bed at the official shelter becomes available.

(f) For a Returnee who is not referred to a diversion office for a Single Adult Resource Assessment, diversion staff may, at their discretion, conduct such an assessment over the phone with the Returnee at his or her official shelter.

(c) Participation in the ISP Program will be a shelter program requirement for such individuals.








*§ 4-03 Savings Amounts and Adjustments.* ::


(a) Beginning in the month following their enrollment in the program, program participants residing in a DHS shelter for single adults will receive a monthly savings statement, which shall include:

   (1) The program participant's deposit balance:

      (A) For participants using accounts held by DSS, this amount shall equal the sum of all funds deposited by the program participant to their client account to date, minus any amounts released to the program participant to date.

      (B) For participants approved to use their own commercial bank account, this amount shall equal the change in the participant's account balance between their enrollment in ISP and the most recent bank statement they have provided to DHS.

   (2) The current month's savings request as calculated pursuant to subdivision (b) of this section, and the information on which such amount was calculated, including the program participant's earned income, any approved deductions to such income pursuant to subdivision (c) of this section, and the number of days in shelter during the current savings month;

   (3) The current amount due to be deposited:

      (A) For participants using accounts held by DSS, this amount shall be equal to the sum of any amount due in the previous savings month, the current month's savings request and any funds released to the program participant during the current savings month pursuant to 31 RCNY § 4-05(c), reduced by the sum of any deposits made during the current savings month pursuant to 31 RCNY § 4-03(d) and any one-time adjustments made during the current savings month, all of which shall be listed on the savings statement;

      (B) For participants approved to use their own commercial bank account, this amount shall be equal to the sum of any amount due in the previous savings month and the current month's savings request, either reduced by the difference between the balance in the client's account at the beginning and the end of the month, if the balance has increased, or increased by such difference if such balance has decreased, and further reduced by any one-time adjustments made during the current savings month, all of which shall be listed on the savings statement; and

   (4) For participants using accounts held by DSS, the date the amount is due to be deposited, which shall be no earlier than the twenty-fifth day of the month, and information on how to make a deposit, and for participants approved to use their own commercial accounts, information on how and when to submit a copy of their bank statement.

   (5) Information on how to challenge the amount due and how to request a deduction to earned income or a one-time adjustment to the amount due pursuant to subdivision (c) of this section.

(b) DHS will calculate a program participant's savings request for any given savings month by taking thirty (30) percent of the program participant's earned income as of the last day of the savings month, subject to any deductions to earned income that have been approved pursuant to subdivision (c) of this section, and prorating it based on the number of days the program participant resided in a DHS shelter for single adults in that month. For example, if the program participant was in a DHS shelter for single adults for only one day out of thirty in a given month and no deductions to earned income have been approved pursuant to subdivision (c) of this section, the savings request will be 1/30th of 30% of the program participant's monthly earned income as of the last day of the current savings month. In this example, if a deduction to earned income had been approved pursuant to subdivision (c) of this section, the savings request would be 1/30 of 30% of the program participant's earned income after such deduction was applied.

(c) Program participants may request that DHS apply a deduction to the earned income used to calculate their savings requests or make a one-time adjustment to the amount due to be deposited. DHS will assess such requests for deductions to earned income or adjustments to the amount due for good cause on a case by case basis. If DHS approves a request to apply a deduction to earned income, DHS will determine for what period of time the deduction will apply based on documentation provided by the individual.

(d) If a program participant wishes to deposit more than the amount due in their client account, they may do so at any time. For participants using accounts held by DSS, any deposit amount in excess of the amount due will be deducted from the amount due the following month.

(e) Once enrolled in the ISP Program, program participants must report any changes in income within a timeframe and in a form and manner to be designated by DHS.

(f) The past amount due will be set to zero when a program participant has been out of shelter for thirty (30) consecutive days, regardless of whether the funds in their client account have been returned to them at that time, or whenever funds are released to the program participant pursuant to 31 RCNY § 4-05(b).








*§ 4-04 Enforcement of ISP Program Requirements through Immediately Curable Shelter Sanctions.* ::


(a) If a program participant fails to make the deposits set forth on their savings statements, DHS will schedule a case conference with the individual to discuss their non-compliance with program requirements and will provide the program participant with an opportunity to cure the non-compliance.

(b) If non-compliance remains unresolved following the case conference, the program participant will be provided with written notice that their shelter may be discontinued and an opportunity to demonstrate good cause for the non-compliance or to cure the non-compliance by depositing funds in their savings account.

   (1) Good cause will be determined on a case-by-case basis, taking into account other liabilities, medical or other emergencies, need, and good faith attempts to comply.

   (2) Any temporary discontinuance of shelter shall be non-durational and immediately curable upon deposit of an amount of funds in their ISP Program account consistent with arrangements regarding the timing and amount of the deposit reached between the program participant and DHS in a case conference.

(c) An individual who receives the notice specified in subdivision (b) of this section shall be entitled to administrative review of the decision to discontinue shelter under 31 RCNY § 4-06.








*§ 4-05 Return of Savings.* ::


Funds in client accounts held by DSS pursuant to this chapter will be returned to individuals or their designees under the following circumstances:

(a) Standard Release After Exit: Once a program participant has been out of DHS shelter for thirty (30) consecutive days, DHS will release the funds in their client account, including any interest that has accrued, to the individual, or such other individual or entity that the individual has designated, between thirty (30) and forty-five (45) days after shelter exit. If the client has not provided instructions to DHS as to where and how their funds shall be conveyed to the client or designee, or if funds distributed are returned to DHS as undeliverable or are not taken into possession by the client or designee, DHS will hold the unreturned funds for one year and perform due diligence to locate the individual during that time. Funds that DHS is unable to return within one year of shelter exit will be considered unclaimed and processed in accordance with State law.

(b) Expedited Release After Exit: DHS may release the funds in a program participant's client account, including any interest that has accrued, to the program participant or their designee following their exit from DHS shelter, but before thirty (30) days have passed, at the request of the individual for good cause where DHS has determined that the program participant is unlikely to return to shelter.

(c) Early Release Prior to Exit: DHS may approve early release of funds to a program participant to assist the individual with documented expenses necessary to arrange for permanent housing or, in its discretion and on a case-by-case basis, for reasons other than to arrange for permanent housing. Such approval shall not be unreasonably withheld. In the event that funds are released to an individual pursuant to this subdivision, the individual's current amount due will be increased by the amount of the funds that were released. If the program participant wishes to be relieved of the obligation to return such funds to their client account, they may request a one-time adjustment pursuant to 31 RCNY § 4-03(c).

Upon request by telephone or in writing, DHS shall provide such individual with copies of all such documents, and copies of any additional documents in the possession of DHS that the individual identifies and requests for purposes of preparing for the administrative hearing. DHS shall provide such documents at no charge reasonably in advance of the administrative hearing. If the request for such documents is made less than five business days before the administrative hearing, DHS must provide the individual with copies of such documents no later than at the time of the administrative hearing.

(h) Adjournment. The administrative hearing may be adjourned for good cause by the administrative hearing officer on their own motion or at the request of the individual who requested the hearing or their authorized representative, or DHS.

   (4) An audio recording, an audio visual recording or written transcript of the administrative hearing shall be made.

(j) Abandonment of Request for Administrative Hearing.

   (1) DSS will consider an administrative hearing request abandoned if neither the individual who requested the hearing nor their authorized representative appears at the administrative hearing, unless either the individual or their authorized representative has:

      (A) contacted DSS prior to the administrative hearing to request rescheduling of the administrative hearing; or

      (B) within fifteen calendar days of the scheduled administrative hearing date, contacted DSS and provided a good cause reason for failing to appear at the administrative hearing on the scheduled date.
