   (1) The use of physical restraint or seclusion of inmates being observed or treated for mental or emotional disorders shall be permitted only where there is on-duty psychiatric coverage.

   (2) Physical restraint or seclusion may be used only upon the direct written order of a psychiatrist which includes the reasons for taking such action.

      (i) the inmate presents an immediate danger of injury to self or others;

      (ii) this potential for violence is the result of a mental health disorder for which the inmate is receiving treatment;

      (iii) these measures are absolutely necessary to avert the danger and will be therapeutically beneficial; and

      (iv) all other available alternatives are ineffective in preventing injury.

   (4) An inmate put in restraints or seclusion shall be kept under constant observation and the need for continued restrictive measures shall be assessed by nursing or mental health staff:

      (i) use of restraints shall be assessed every fifteen minutes and seclusion shall be reviewed every thirty minutes;

   (2) When placement in punitive segregation would pose a serious threat to an inmate's physical or mental health, medical staff shall have the authority to determine that the inmate shall be barred from such placement or shall be moved from punitive segregation to a more appropriate housing unit. This determination may be made at any time during the inmate's placement in punitive segregation. All inmates in punitive segregation shall be seen at least once each day by medical staff who shall make referrals to medical and mental health services where appropriate.

Visitation with friends and family plays an instrumental role in an inmate's ability to maintain these connections and should therefore be encouraged and facilitated by the Department. Additionally, the Board recognizes that an inmate's family may not be limited to those related to the inmate by blood or by legally-recognized bonds, such as marriage or adoption. Therefore, the term "family" as it is used in this subdivision should be construed broadly to reflect the diversity of familial structures and the wide variety of relationships that may closely connect an inmate to others. This should include, for example, but may not be limited to: romantic partners; godparents and godchildren; current and former step-parents, children, and siblings; and those connected to the inmate through current or former domestic partnerships, foster arrangements, civil unions, or cohabitation.

(b) Visiting and waiting areas.

   (1) A visiting area of sufficient size to meet the requirements of this section shall be established and maintained in each facility.

   (2) The visiting area shall be designed so as to allow physical contact between prisoners and their visitors as required by subdivision (f) of this section.

   (3) The Department shall make every effort to minimize the waiting time prior to a visit. Visitors shall not be required to wait outside a facility unless adequate shelter is provided and the requirements of paragraph (b)(4) of this section are met.

   (4) All waiting and visiting areas shall provide for at least minimal comforts for visitors, including but not limited to:

      (i) sufficient seats for all visitors;

      (ii) access to bathroom facilities and drinking water throughout the waiting and visiting periods;

      (iii) access to vending machines for beverages and foodstuffs at some point during the waiting or visiting period; and

      (iv) access to a Spanish-speaking employee or volunteer at some point during the waiting or visiting period. All visiting rules, regulations and hours shall be clearly posted in English and Spanish in the waiting and visiting areas at each facility.

   (5) The Department shall make every effort to utilize outdoor areas for visits during the warm weather months.

(c) Visiting schedule.

   (1) Visiting hours may be varied to fit the schedules of individual facilities but must meet the following minimum requirements for detainees:

Visits by properly identified persons providing services or assistance, including lawyers, doctors, religious advisors, public officials, therapists, counselors and media representatives, shall not count against this number.

   (6) There shall be no limit to the number of visits by a particular visitor or category of visitors.

   (7) In addition to the minimum number of visits required by paragraphs (1), (2) and (5) of this subdivision, additional visitation shall be provided in cases involving special necessity, including but not limited to, emergency situations and situations involving lengthy travel time.

   (8) Prisoners shall be permitted to visit with at least three visitors at the same time, with the maximum number to be determined by the facility.

   (9) Visitors shall be permitted to visit with at least two prisoners at the same time, with the maximum number to be determined by the facility.

   (5) Supervision shall be provided during visits solely to ensure that the safety or security of the facility is maintained.

   (6) Visits shall not be listened to or monitored unless a lawful warrant is obtained, although visual supervision should be maintained.

(h) Restrictions on visitation rights.

   (1) The visitation rights of an inmate with a particular visitor may be denied, revoked or limited only when it is determined that the exercise of those rights constitutes a serious threat to the safety or security of a facility, provided that visitation rights with a particular visitor may be denied only if revoking the right to contact visits would not suffice to reduce the serious threat.

      This determination must be based on specific acts committed by the visitor during a prior visit to a facility that demonstrate the visitor's threat to the safety and security of a facility, or on specific information received and verified that the visitor plans to engage in acts during the next visit that will be a threat to the safety or security of the facility. Prior to any determination, the visitor must be provided with written notification of the specific charges and the names and statements of the charging parties, and be afforded an opportunity to respond.

   (2) An inmate's right to contact visits as provided in subdivision (f) of this section may be denied, revoked, or limited only when it is determined that such visits constitute a serious threat to the safety or security of a facility. Should a determination be made to deny, revoke or limit an inmate's right to contact visits in the usual manner, alternative arrangements for affording the inmate the requisite number of visits shall be made, including, but not limited to, non-contact visits.

      This determination must be based on specific acts committed by the inmate while in custody under the present charge or sentence that demonstrate the inmate's threat to the safety and security of a facility, or on specific information received and verified that the inmate plans to engage in acts during the next visit that will be a threat to the safety or security of the facility. Prior to any determination, the inmate must be provided with written notification of the specific charges and the names and statements of the charging parties, and be afforded an opportunity to respond. The name of an informant may be withheld if necessary to protect the informant's safety.

      (ii) compliance is to be achieved in an alternative manner sufficient to meet the intent of the subdivision or section.

   (3) The Department may apply to the Board for an emergency variance when an emergency situation prevents continued compliance with the subdivision or section. An emergency variance for a period of less than 24 hours may be declared by the Department when an emergency situation prevents continued compliance with a particular subdivision or section. The Board or its designee shall be immediately notified of the emergency situation and the variance declaration.

(c) Variance application.

   (1) An application for a variance must be made in writing to the Board by the Commissioner of the Department as soon as a determination is made that continued compliance will not be possible and shall state:

      (i) the type of variance requested;

      (ii) the particular subdivision or section at issue;

      (iii) the requested commencement date of the variance;

      (iv) the efforts undertaken by the Department to achieve compliance by the effective date;

      (v) the specific facts or reasons making full compliance impossible, and when those facts and reasons became apparent;

      (vi) the specific plans, projections and timetables for achieving full compliance;

      (vii) the specific plans for serving the purpose of the subdivision or section for the period that strict compliance is not possible; and

      (viii) if the application is for a limited variance, the time period for which the variance is requested, provided that this shall be no more than six months.

   (2) In addition to the provisions of paragraph (1) of this subdivision, an application for a continuing variance shall state:

      (i) the specific facts and reasons underlying the impracticability or impossibility of compliance within the foreseeable future, and when those facts and reasons become apparent, and

      (ii) the degree of compliance achieved, and the Department's efforts to mitigate any possible danger or hardships attributable to the lack of full compliance; or

      (iii) a description of the specific plans for achieving compliance in an alternative manner sufficient to meet the intent of the subdivision or section.

   (3) In addition to the requirements of paragraph (1) of this subdivision, an application for an emergency variance for a period of 24 hours or more, (or for renewal of an emergency variance) shall state:

      (i) the particular subdivision or section at issue;

      (ii) the specific facts or reasons making continued compliance impossible, and when those facts and reasons became apparent;

      (iii) the specific plans, projections and timetables for achieving full compliance; and

      (iv) the time period for which the variance is requested, provided that this shall be no more than thirty days.

(d) Variance procedure for limited and continuing variance.

   (3) The Board's decision on a variance application shall be in writing.

   (4) Interested parties shall be notified of the Board's decision as soon as practicable, and no later than 5 business days after the decision is made.

(e) Granting of variance.

   (1) The Board shall grant a variance only if it is presented with convincing evidence that the variance is necessary and justified.

   (2) Upon granting a variance, the Board shall state:

      (i) the type of variance

      (ii) the date on which the variance will commence

      (iii) the time period of the variance, if any, and

      (iv) any requirements imposed as conditions on the variance.

(f) Renewal and review of variance.

   (1) An application for a renewal of a limited or emergency variance shall be treated in the same manner as an original application as provided in subdivisions (b), (c), (d) and (e) of this section. The Board shall not grant renewal of a variance unless it finds that, in addition to the requirements for approving an original application, a good faith effort has been made to comply with the subdivision or section within the previously prescribed time limitation, and that the requirements set by the Board as conditions on the original variance have been met.

Where appropriate, the Board shall set an effective date for discontinuance of a continuing variance after consultation with all interested parties.

   (4) The Board shall not grant more than two consecutive renewals of emergency variances.






*§ 1-16 Enhanced Supervision Housing.* ::


(a) Purpose. The primary objective of enhanced supervision housing (ESH) is to protect the safety and security of inmates and facilities, while promoting rehabilitation, good behavior, and the psychological and physical well-being of inmates. To accomplish these objectives, ESH is designed to separate from the general population those inmates who pose the greatest threats to the safety and security of staff and other inmates. It additionally seeks to promote the rehabilitation of ESH inmates by incentivizing good behavior and by providing necessary programs and therapeutic resources.

(b) Policy. An inmate may be confined in ESH if the inmate presents a significant threat to the safety and security of the facility if housed elsewhere. Such a determination shall only be supported by a finding that one of the following has occurred:

   (1) the inmate has been identified as a leader of a gang and has demonstrated active involvement in the organization or perpetration of violent or dangerous gang-related activity;

   (2) the inmate has demonstrated active involvement as an organizer or perpetrator of a gang-related assault;

   (3) the inmate has committed a slashing or stabbing, has committed repeated assaults, has seriously injured another inmate, visitor, or employee, or has rioted or actively participated in inmate disturbances while in Department custody or otherwise incarcerated;

   (4) the inmate has been found in possession of a scalpel or a weapon that poses a level of danger similar to or greater than that of a scalpel while in Department custody or otherwise incarcerated;

   (5) the inmate has engaged in serious or persistent violence; or

   (6) the inmate, while in Department custody or otherwise incarcerated, has engaged in repeated activity or behavior of a gravity and degree of danger similar to the acts described in paragraphs (1) through (5) of this subdivision, and such activity or behavior has a direct, identifiable and adverse impact on the safety and security of the facility, such as repeated acts of arson.

Provided, however, that, where the Department is permitted to consider an inmate's activity occurring or actions committed at a time when the inmate was incarcerated, such activity or actions must have occurred within the preceding five (5) years. Where the Department is permitted to consider an inmate's activity occurring or actions committed at a time when the inmate was not incarcerated, such activity or actions must have occurred within the preceding two (2) years.

(c) Exclusions.

   (1) The following categories of inmates shall be excluded from ESH placement:

      (i) inmates under the age of 18;

      (ii) as of January 1, 2016, inmates ages 18 through 21, provided that sufficient resources are made available to the Department for necessary staffing and implementation of necessary alternative programming; and

      (iii) inmates with serious mental or serious physical disabilities or conditions.

   (2) Medical staff shall be permitted to review ESH placements and participate in placement review hearings. Consistent with these regulations, when ESH assignment would pose a serious threat to an inmate's physical or mental health, medical staff shall have the authority to determine that the inmate shall be barred from ESH placement or shall be moved from ESH to a more appropriate housing unit. This determination may be made at any time during the inmate's incarceration.

   (3) Any inmate placed in ESH who evidences a mental or emotional disorder shall be seen by mental health services staff prior to or immediately upon ESH placement.

   (4) The total number of inmates housed in ESH shall not exceed 250 at any time.

(d) Conditions, Programming and Services.

   (1) To the extent the Department imposes restrictions on an ESH inmate that deviate from those imposed on inmates in the general population, such restrictions must be limited to those required to address the specific safety and security threat posed by that individual inmate.

   (2) To the extent the Department seeks to limit an ESH inmate's access to contact visits, a hearing shall be held, as required by subdivision (g) of this section, which shall address the criteria set forth in subdivision (h) of 40 RCNY § 1-09 with regard to both the inmate and any individual visitors with whom the Department wishes to limit contact.

   (3) No later than July 1, 2015, the Department shall provide ESH inmates with both voluntary and involuntary, as well as both in- and out-of-cell, programming aimed at facilitating rehabilitation, addressing root causes of violence, and minimizing idleness.

   (4) All inmates in ESH shall be seen at least once each day by medical staff who shall make referrals to medical and mental health services where appropriate.

(e) Staffing.

   (1) Correction officers assigned to ESH shall receive forty (40) hours of special training designed to address the unique characteristics of ESH and its inmates. Such training shall include, but shall not be limited to, recognition and understanding of mental illness and distress, effective communication skills, and conflict de-escalation techniques.

   (2) At least twenty-five (25) percent of correction staff assigned to ESH shall be assigned to steady posts.

(f) Notice of ESH Placement.

   (1) When it is determined that an inmate should be confined in ESH, that inmate shall be given written notice of such determination within twenty-four (24) hours of placement. Inmates who are unable to read or understand such notice shall be provided with necessary assistance. Such notice shall:

      (i) state the grounds relied on and the facts that support the inmate's ESH placement; (ii) inform the inmate of the individual restrictions the Department intends to impose during the inmate's ESH confinement;

      (iii) notify the inmate of the upcoming ESH placement review hearing; and

      (iv) inform the inmate of the right to review, prior to the placement hearing, the evidence relied upon by the Department, to appear at the hearing in person, to submit a written statement for consideration, to call witnesses, and to present evidence.

   (2) [Reserved.]

(g) Placement Review Hearing.

   (1) Within three (3) business days of service of notice on an inmate of initial ESH placement and related restrictions, the Department shall conduct a hearing to adjudicate the inmate's ESH placement and the individual restrictions proposed. The hearing may not be adjourned except, in extenuating circumstances, by the inmate's documented request and may in no event be adjourned for longer than five (5) days.

   (2) One or more hearing officers shall conduct the placement review hearing. Department staff who initially recommended the inmate for ESH placement or otherwise provided evidence to support the inmate's ESH placement shall not be eligible to serve as hearing officers at the inmate's placement review hearing.

   (3) The placement review hearing shall consist of following:

      (i) a review of the facts upon which the Department relies to place the inmate in ESH pursuant to subdivision (b) of this section, and a determination of whether such facts exist and whether they support, by a preponderance of the evidence, the conclusion that the inmate presents a current significant threat to the safety and security of the facility such that ESH is appropriate;

      (ii) consideration of the time that has elapsed since the occurrence of the activity or behavior relied on by the Department to support ESH placement;

      (iii) a review of the individual restrictions proposed by the Department and a determination of whether each is supported by evidence of the legitimate safety and security concerns related to that individual inmate;

      (iv) consideration of any relevant information provided by medical staff;

      (v) consideration of any credible and relevant evidence submitted or statements made by the inmate at the hearing; and

      (vi) consideration of any other evidence deemed relevant to the ESH status determination or imposition of individual restrictions.

   (4) The inmate shall be permitted to appear at the hearing in person, submit a written statement, call witnesses, and present evidence.

   (5) In the following circumstances, the inmate shall be entitled to the assistance of a hearing facilitator, who shall assist the inmate by clarifying the charges, explaining the hearing process, and assisting the inmate in gathering evidence:

      (i) the inmate is illiterate or otherwise unable to prepare for or understand the hearing process; or

      (ii) the inmate has otherwise been unable to obtain witnesses or material evidence.

   (6) If it is determined that the ESH placement and each related restriction are supported by a preponderance of the evidence, the placement and each supported restriction may be continued. Written notice shall be provided to the inmate outlining the bases for such determinations. If it is determined that ESH placement or imposition of any individual restrictions is unsupported by a preponderance of the evidence, ESH status or unsupported individual restrictions shall be terminated immediately.

(h) Periodic Review of Placement.

   (1) The placement of an inmate in ESH shall be reviewed every forty-five (45) days to determine whether the inmate continues to present a significant threat to the safety and security of the facility if housed outside ESH such that continued ESH placement is appropriate.

   (2) At least twenty-four (24) hours prior to such periodic review, inmates shall be notified of the pending review in writing and of the right to submit a written statement for consideration. Inmates who are unable to read or understand such notice shall be provided with necessary assistance.

   (3) Periodic review of an inmate's ESH status shall consider the following, with conclusions recorded in a written report made available to the inmate within seven (7) days of the review: (i) the justifications for continued ESH placement;

      (ii) the continued appropriateness of each individual ESH restriction and whether any such individual restrictions should be relaxed or lifted;

      (iii) information regarding the inmate's subsequent behavior and attitude since ESH placement began, including participation in and availability of programming;

      (iv) information regarding the effect of ESH placement or of individual ESH restrictions on the inmate's mental and physical health;

      (v) any written statement submitted by the inmate for consideration;

      (vi) any other factors that may favor retaining the inmate in or releasing the inmate from ESH or any other factors that may favor the lifting of individual ESH restrictions or continuing to impose individual ESH restrictions; and

      (vii) if the inmate's ESH placement is to continue, any actions or behavioral changes that the inmate might undertake to further rehabilitative goals and facilitate the lifting of individual ESH restrictions or ESH release.

   (4) At any time when deemed appropriate, an inmate may be evaluated and recommended for placement in a more appropriate housing unit outside ESH.

(i) Board Review of ESH Implementation.

   (1) No later than sixty (60) days after ESH implementation and every sixty (60) days thereafter, the Department shall submit to the Board information related to implementation of ESH and the inmates housed there. This information shall include, but shall not be limited to:

      (i) the number of inmates housed in ESH, both currently and since implementation;

      (ii) the frequency with which each of the criteria set forth in subdivision (b) of this section is used to support ESH placement;

      (iii) rates of violence in both ESH and the general population since implementation of ESH and rates of violence for comparable time periods prior to ESH implementation;

      (iv) rates of use of force in both ESH and the general population since implementation of ESH;

      (v) programming and mental health resources available to ESH inmates and the extent of inmate participation in each program and resource;

      (vi) training received by correction officers assigned to ESH and the number of steady posts created in ESH;

      (vii) the number of inmates initially assigned to ESH but whose ESH status was terminated in a placement review hearing;

      (viii) the number of inmates released from ESH into the general population through periodic review or other ESH status review mechanisms; and

      (ix) any other data the Department or the Board deems relevant to the Board's assessment of ESH.

   (2) The Board shall review the information provided by the Department and any other information it deems relevant to the assessment of ESH. Eighteen (18) months after implementation of ESH and no later than two (2) years after implementation of ESH, the Board shall meet to discuss the effectiveness and continued appropriateness of ESH.






*§ 1-17 Limitations on the Use of Punitive Segregation.* ::


(a) Policy. As implemented by the Department, punitive segregation is a severe penalty that should not be used under certain circumstances in the Department's facilities. In particular, punitive segregation represents a serious threat to the physical and psychological health of adolescents, with respect to whom it should not be imposed. Moreover, punitive segregation is intended to address a particular offense committed in the course of an inmate's incarceration and should not be imposed in connection with an offense committed by the same inmate during a separate and previous incarceration.

(b) Exclusions.

   (1) The following categories of inmates shall be excluded from punitive segregation:

      (i) inmates under the age of 18;

      (ii) as of January 1, 2016, inmates ages 18 through 21, provided that sufficient resources are made available to the Department for necessary staffing and implementation of necessary alternative programming; and

      (iii) inmates with serious mental or serious physical disabilities or conditions.

   (2) Consistent with these regulations, when assignment to punitive segregation would pose a serious threat to an inmate's physical or mental health, medical staff shall have the authority to determine that the inmate shall be barred from punitive segregation placement or shall be moved from punitive segregation to a more appropriate housing unit.

   (3) An inmate who is excluded from punitive segregation at the time of an infraction due to age or health status shall not be placed in punitive segregation for the same infraction at a later date, regardless of whether the inmate's age or health status has since changed.

   (4) Inmates shall not be confined to punitive segregation as punishment for grade 3 offenses.

(c) Due Process.

   (1) Prior to the infraction hearing provided for in paragraph (2) of this subdivision, the inmate shall receive written notice detailing the charges against the inmate and a description of the inmate's behavior that gave rise to the charges. Inmates who are unable to read or understand such notice shall be provided with necessary assistance. Notice shall be served no later twenty-four (24) hours prior to commencement of the infraction hearing unless the inmate consents to a shorter time period in writing.

   (2) All inmates, except those who qualify for and are placed in pre-hearing detention (PHD), shall be afforded an infraction hearing prior to placement in punitive segregation housing. Inmates who qualify for and are placed in PHD shall be afforded an infraction hearing no later than seven (7) business days after PHD placement, and time spent in PHD prior to the infraction hearing shall count toward the inmate's punitive segregation sentence.

   (3) Inmates shall be permitted to appear in person, make statements, present material evidence, and call witnesses at infraction hearings.

   (4) In the following circumstances, an inmate shall be entitled to the assistance of a hearing facilitator, who shall assist the inmate by clarifying the charges, explaining the hearing process, and assisting the inmate in gathering evidence:

      (i) the inmate is illiterate or otherwise unable to prepare for or understand the hearing process; or

      (ii) the inmate has otherwise been unable to obtain witnesses or material evidence.

   (5) The Department has the burden of proof in all inmate disciplinary proceedings. An inmate's guilt must be shown by a preponderance of the evidence to justify punitive segregation placement.

(d) Time limitations on punitive segregation.

   (1) Except where an inmate has committed a serious assault on staff as described in paragraph (4) of this subdivision, no inmate may be sentenced to punitive segregation for more than thirty (30) days for any single infraction.

   (2) Except where an inmate is serving a punitive segregation sentence for a serious assault on staff as described in paragraph (4) of this subdivision, in no event may an inmate be held in punitive segregation longer than thirty (30) consecutive days. Except where an inmate is serving a punitive segregation sentence for a serious assault on staff as described in paragraph (4) of this subdivision, an inmate who has served thirty (30) consecutive days in punitive segregation shall be released from punitive segregation for at least seven (7) days before that inmate may be returned to punitive segregation.

   (3) An inmate may not be held in punitive segregation for more than a total of sixty (60) days within any six (6) month period, unless, upon completion of or throughout the sixty (60) day period, the inmate has continued to engage in persistent, serious acts of violence, other than self-harm, such that any placement other than punitive segregation would endanger inmates or staff.

      (i) In such instances, the Department shall not be required to release the inmate from punitive segregation after sixty (60) days have elapsed.

      (ii) The Chief of Department must approve such extensions of punitive segregation placement in writing and state: (1) the reasons why placement in a less restrictive setting has been deemed inappropriate or unavailable, and (2) why retaining the inmate in punitive segregation is necessary to ensure the safety of inmates or staff.

      (iii) The Department must immediately provide the Board and the relevant Correctional Health Authority with a copy of the Chief of Department's written approval.

   (4) Inmates sentenced to punitive segregation for an assault on staff that causes staff to suffer one or more serious injuries, as listed under the Department's definition of "A" Use of Force Incidents, may receive a punitive segregation sentence of up to sixty (60) days for that single infraction.

      (i) The Chief of Department or a designee must approve or disapprove in writing any punitive segregation sentence for a serious assault on staff that exceeds thirty (30) days. The written approval or disapproval shall be sent immediately to the inmate, the Board, and the relevant Correctional Health Authority.

      (ii) While an inmate is serving a punitive segregation sentence for a serious assault on staff that exceeds thirty (30) days, the Department shall not be required to release the inmate from punitive segregation housing after thirty (30) consecutive days.

      (iii) Where an inmate's punitive segregation sentence for a serious assault on staff exceeds forty-five (45) days, the Chief of Department or a designee shall complete a review of the sentence forty-five (45) days after its commencement to determine whether the inmate could safely be placed in an available alternative housing unit for the remainder of the sentence. The decision, and the reasoning supporting it, shall be stated in writing and immediately sent to the inmate, the Board, and the relevant Correctional Health Authority.

   (5) In instances not covered by subparagraph (iii) of paragraph (4) of this subdivision, whenever forty-five (45) consecutive days of an inmate's time served in punitive segregation have elapsed, the Chief of Department or a designee shall complete a review of the inmate's time served on the forty-fifth (45th) day to determine whether the inmate can safely be placed in an alternative housing unit for the remainder of the sentence the inmate is serving. The decision, and the reasoning supporting it, shall be stated in writing and immediately sent to the inmate, the Board and the relevant Correctional Health Authority.

   (6) Daily mental health rounds must be provided to inmates housed in punitive segregation who have been held there longer than thirty (30) consecutive days or have served more than sixty (60) days within a six (6) month period. Such rounds must be documented in writing. Beginning August 1, 2016, the Department shall additionally offer such inmates cognitive behavioral therapy or a similar evidence-based intervention aimed at addressing the root causes of the behavior that led to the inmates' extended stays in punitive segregation. Such programming shall be developed in consultation with the relevant Correctional Health Authority.

(e) Required out-of-cell time. Inmates confined to punitive segregation as punishment for non-violent or grade 2 offenses must be permitted at least seven (7) out-of-cell hours per day.

(f) Staffing.

   (1) Correction officers assigned to punitive segregation housing shall receive forty (40) hours of special training designed to address the unique characteristics of punitive segregation and its inmates. Such training shall include, but shall not be limited to, recognition and understanding of mental illness and distress, effective communication skills, and conflict de-escalation techniques.

   (2) At least twenty-five (25) percent of correction staff assigned to punitive segregation housing shall be assigned to steady posts.

(g) Time in punitive segregation owed from a previous incarceration. As of the effective date of this section, no inmate shall be assigned to or held in punitive segregation for any time from a separate and previous incarceration for which such inmate was sentenced to but did not serve in punitive segregation.

(h) Reports on punitive segregation.

   (1) No later than sixty (60) days after implementation of enhanced supervision housing provided for in 40 RCNY § 1-16 of this chapter and every sixty (60) days thereafter, the Department shall submit to the Board information related to implementation of required changes to punitive segregation. This information shall include, but shall not be limited to:

      (i) the number of inmates held in punitive segregation and the number of inmates waiting to be held in punitive segregation;

      (ii) data related to the length of punitive segregation sentences and the frequency of the types of offences resulting in punitive segregation sentences;

*§ 3-12 Shackling of Inmates.* ::


(a) Policy. The Department of Correction, the Health Authority, and the Health and Hospitals Corporation shall develop and implement procedures governing the shackling of inmates who are receiving medical treatment and are housed in beds outside secure medical wards at the municipal hospitals. Inmates housed outside secure medical wards shall not be routinely shackled. The decision to shackle shall be made on a case by case basis and shall not serve as a substitute for appropriate security precautions or as punishment or for the convenience of staff. Shackling of inmates being transported between clinical settings shall be the least restrictive possible. All non-emergency decisions to shackle inmates must not be medically contraindicated.

(b) Definition. Shackling includes the use of all devices which encircle the ankle or wrist of an inmate and restrict movement.

(c) Procedures. The procedures developed for inmates housed in hospitals in beds outside of secure medical wards must include the following:

   (1) Shackling shall be used only upon the direction of the Chief Correctional Officer or his/her designee after a review of the individual case. Pending the receipt of security-related information necessary to perform the review, an inmate may be shackled unless he/she falls into categories listed in (3)(i) through (iv) below. This security-related information must be obtained promptly.

   (2) Shackling shall only be used when a Chief Correctional Officer or his/her designee demonstrates with clear and articulable facts that twenty-four hour officer coverage may be insufficient to protect the safety of others or to prevent escape.

   (3) An inmate who is to be restrained shall be seen by a physician. DOC will not shackle an inmate where a physician has determined that the inmate is:

      (i) pregnant and admitted for delivery of a baby; or

      (ii) dependent on a ventilator or respirator; or

      (iii) in imminent danger or expectation of death (unless the inmate while in the condition described by (i)-(iii) above attempts to escape or engages in violent behavior at the hospital which presents a danger of injury); or

      (iv) where shackling is medically contraindicated. Provided, however, that should an inmate, while in a condition described by (iv) above, attempt to escape or engage in violent behavior at the hospital which presents a danger of injury, he/she may be restrained pending an immediate review of his/her medical condition by a physician to determine whether the use of shackles threatens the inmate's life. DOC shall promptly make alternative security arrangements before the restraints are removed, unless a life-threatening condition exists. In the case of a life-threatening condition, the shackles shall be removed immediately.

   (4) At least daily, physicians shall update and review the medical condition of shackled inmates. They shall convey their findings to the Department of Correction including whether the use of mechanical restraints, while the inmate ambulates is medically contraindicated.

   (5) A shackled inmate shall be given the opportunity to use the bathroom as often as the need arises unless the physician has ordered the use of bed pans instead.

   (6) The decision to shackle an inmate shall be reviewed on a daily basis by a Chief Correctional Officer or his/her designee and must be revised immediately if a physician determines that the shackles have become medically contraindicated. In the latter case, unless a life-threatening medical emergency exists, DOC shall have the opportunity to make alternative security arrangements, if necessary, before the shackles are removed. These arrangements must be made promptly.

   (7) All decisions to apply mechanical restraints will be made by the Department of Correction's office of operations.

   (8) Written records shall be maintained at the hospitals which indicated the reason for shackling, the time and date of the approval for shackling, the name and title of the person giving approval, and the inmate's name, book and case number and medical status.

   (9) Hospital-based physicians caring for inmates outside secure medical wards at the municipal hospitals shall receive training in this standard.

   (2) A Department may apply to the Board for a continuing variance when despite its best efforts and the best efforts of other New York City officials compliance cannot be achieved in the foreseeable future because:

      (i) full compliance with a Section or Subdivision creates extreme practical difficulties as a result of circumstances unique to the design of a particular facility, and lack of full compliance would not create a danger or undue hardship to staff or inmates; or

      (ii) compliance is to be achieved in an alternative manner sufficient to meet the intent of the Section or Subdivision.

   (3) A Department may apply to the Board for an emergency variance when an emergency situation prevents continued compliance with the Section or Subdivision.

The Board or a designee shall be immediately notified of the emergency situation and the variance application.

(d) Variance Application.

   (1) An application for a variance must be made in writing to the Board by the Commissioner of a Department as soon as a determination is made that continued compliance will not be possible and shall state:

      (i) the type of variance requested;

      (ii) the particular Section or Subdivision at issue;

      (iii) the requested commencement date of the variance;

      (iv) the efforts undertaken by a Department to achieve compliance;

      (i) the specific facts or reasons making continued compliance impossible, and when those facts and reasons became apparent;

      (ii) the specific plans, projections and timetables for achieving full compliance; and

      (iii) the time period for which the variance is requested, provided that this shall be no more than thirty days.

(e) Variance procedure for limited and continuing variances.

   (1) Prior to a decision on a variance application for a limited or continuing variance, whenever practicable, the Board will consider the positions of all interested parties, including correctional employees, health service professionals, inmates and their representatives, other public officials and legal religious and community organizations.

   (2) Whenever practicable, the Board shall hold a public meeting or hearing on the variance application and hear testimony from all interested parties.

   (3) The Board's decision on a variance application shall be in writing.

   (4) Interested parties shall be notified of the Board's decision as soon as practicable and no later than 5 business days after the decision is made.

(f) Granting of variance.

   (1) The Board shall grant a variance only if it is convinced that the variance is necessary and justified.

   (2) Upon granting a variance, the Board shall state:

      (i) the type of variance;

      (ii) the date on which the variance will commence;

      (iii) the time period of the variance, if any; and

      (iv) any requirements imposed as conditions on the variance.

(g) Renewal of variance.

   (1) An application for a renewal of a limited or emergency variance shall be treated in the same manner as an original application as provided in 40 RCNY § 3-13(c)-(f). The Board shall not grant renewal of a variance unless it finds that, in addition to the requirements for approving an original application, a good faith effort has been made to comply with the Section or Subdivision within the previously prescribed time limitation, and that the requirements set by the Board as conditions on the original variance have been met.

   (2) A petition for review of a continuing variance may be made upon the Board's own motion or by officials of a Department, or its employees, inmates or their representatives. Upon receipt of a petition, the Board shall review and reevaluate the continuing necessity and justification for the continuing variance. Such review shall be conducted in the same manner as the original application as provided in the 40 RCNY § 3-13(c)-(f). The Board will discontinue the variance, if after such review and consideration, it determines that:

      (i) full compliance with the standard can now be achieved; or

      (ii) requirements imposed as conditions upon which the continuing variance was granted have not been fulfilled or maintained; or

      (iii) there is no longer compliance with the intent of the Section or Subdivision in alternative manner as required by 40 RCNY § 3-13(b)(ii).

   (3) The Board shall specify in writing and publicize the facts and reason for its decision on an application for renewal or review of a variance. The Board's decision must comply with the requirements of 40 RCNY § 3-13(f), and, in the case of limited and continuing variances, 40 RCNY § 3-13(e)(3) and (4). Where appropriate, the Board shall set an effective date for discontinuance of a continuing variance after consultation with all interested parties.
