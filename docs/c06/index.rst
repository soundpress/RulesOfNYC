*§ 1-42 Monitoring Requirements.* ::


Monitoring requirements and procedures for other than post-abatement clearance air monitoring are as follows:

(a) The sampling zone for indoor air samples shall be representative of the building occupants' breathing zone. However, at no time shall the sampling cassette be placed less than 4 feet from the ground. Air samplers shall be placed so that they are not influenced by unusual air circulation patterns or by the configuration of the space or by each other. Air sampling cassettes shall be mounted upon commercially-available aluminum tripods and shall not be placed within two feet of walls or obstructions such as the corners of rooms or furniture.

(b) If possible, ambient samplers should be placed about 6 feet above the ground surface in reasonable proximity to the building and away from obstructions and drafts that may unduly affect airflow. For outdoor samples, if access to electricity and concerns about security dictate a rooftop site, locations near vents and other structures on the roof which would unduly affect airflow shall be avoided.

(c) Samples shall have a chain of custody record. The project air sampling log required pursuant to 15 RCNY § 1-37(f) does not satisfy the chain of custody requirement.

(d) In accordance with the above criteria, area samples (see 15 RCNY § 1-41) shall conform to the following schedule:

   (2) Sampling shall not begin until at least 1 hour after the area is dry from the third cleaning (see 15 RCNY § 1-112(e)) and no visible pools of water or condensation remain. For pre-demolition asbestos abatement activity, sampling shall begin 2 hours after the area is dry and no visible pools of water or condensation remain.

(b) Samplers shall be placed at random around the work area. If the work area contains the number of rooms equivalent to the number of required samples based on floor area, a sampler shall be placed in each room. When the number of rooms is greater than the required number of samples a representative sample of rooms shall be selected.

(c) The representative samplers placed outside the work area but within the building shall be located to avoid any air that might escape through the isolation barriers and shall be approximately 50 feet from the entrance to the work area, and 25 feet from the isolation barriers.

(d) The following aggressive sampling procedures shall be used within the work area during all clearance air monitoring:

   (1) Before starting the sampling pumps, use forced air equipment (such as a 1 horsepower leaf blower) to direct exhaust air against all walls, ceilings, floors, ledges and other surfaces in the work area.

      (i) For asbestos projects: this pre-sampling procedure shall take at least 5 minutes per 1,000 sq. ft. of floor area; then install one 20-inch fan per 10,000 cubic feet of room space. Then immediately place the fan on slow speed and point it toward the ceiling.

      (ii) For pre-demolition asbestos abatement activity, this pre-sampling procedure shall take at least three minutes, after which the 20-inch fan shall be left running unattended in the work area throughout sampling. This procedure shall be acceptable when the floor area of the work area is less than 500 square feet. At or above 500 square feet of floor area within the work area, the aggressive sampling procedures specified in this subdivision (d) for asbestos projects shall be conducted.

   (2) Start the sampling pumps and sample for the required time or volume.

   (3) Turn off the pump and then the fan(s) when sampling is completed.

(e) For post-abatement monitoring, area samples shall conform to the following schedule:

(f) Each homogeneous work area which does not meet the clearance criteria shall be thoroughly recleaned using wet methods, with the negative pressure ventilation system in operation. New samples shall be collected in the work area as described above. The process shall be repeated until the work site passes the test.

(g) For an asbestos project with more than one homogenous work area, the release criterion shall be applied independently to each work area.






*§ 1-44 Analysis and Reporting Results.* ::


Laboratory analyses and reporting shall be considered evidence of compliance with this chapter only if they conform to the following requirements:

(a) PCM area air samples shall be analyzed and reported in accordance with the NIOSH 7400 method using "A" Counting Rules.

(b) TEM area air samples shall be analyzed and reported in accordance with the mandatory or non-mandatory Electron Microscopy Methods set forth at 40 C.F.R. Part 763, Subpart E, Appendix A.

(c) Bulk samples shall be analyzed and reported in accordance with Interim Method for the Determination of Asbestiform Materials in Bulk Insulation Samples found in 40 C.F.R. Part 763, Subpart F, Appendix A as amended on September 1, 1982, or other methods approved by the National Institute of Standards and Technology, the National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health, the United States Environmental Protection Agency, or New York State Department of Health.

(d) Bulk and air sampling results/reports shall be submitted directly to the Department upon request within five calendar days.






*§ 1-45 Action Criteria.* ::


(a) When visible emissions occur outside the work area, or any area air sample has indicated a determinant level of fiber concentrations greater than the larger of baseline levels or 0.01 f/cc, work shall stop for inspection.

   (1) For large or small asbestos projects, the integrity of barriers, if disturbed, shall be restored. Clean-up of surfaces outside of the work area using HEPA vacuums or wet cleaning techniques shall be done prior to resuming abatement activities.

   (2) For tent procedures, HVAC systems to or in the work area shall be shut down and the work area shall be wet cleaned or HEPA vacuumed until the area air samples indicate the fiber concentration is below the determinant level. If fiber concentrations remain above the determinant level for longer than 24 hours, isolation barriers and engineering controls shall be installed and maintained.

(b) Clearance and/or reoccupancy criteria. (1) The clearance criteria shall be applied to each homogeneous work area independently.

   (2) For PCM analysis involved in alteration or renovation projects, the clearance air monitoring shall be considered satisfactory when every sample is less than or equal to 0.01 f/cc or less than the ambient concentration, whichever is larger.

   (3) For TEM analysis, the clearance monitoring will be considered satisfactory if conducted in accordance with 40 C.F.R. Part 763, Subpart E, Appendix A Section IV – Mandatory Interpretation of Transmission Electron Microscopy Results to Determine Completion of Response Actions.

   (4) Clearance air monitoring results shall be submitted directly to the Department within 24 hours of request.

*§ 2-08 Performance Testing.* ::


(a) Performance requirements.

   (1) All installations, including pre-existing equipment, must be required to operate such that upon evaluation of performance tests (as outlined in subdivision (e) below) it is determined that they meet the following minimum requirements:

   (2) When the boiler is fired at 80 to 110 percent of the burner's maximum operational oil/gas delivery rate as specified in the application, provided that this is less than the burner's maximum design oil/gas delivery rate, oil burning installations must have a combustion efficiency of at least 83 percent and gas burning installations must have a combustion efficiency of at least 80 percent. Dual-fuel installations must meet the requirements for each respective fuel.

      Oil fired installations which cannot achieve a combustion efficiency of at least 83 percent but which can achieve a combustion efficiency of at least 80 percent will have no more than one renewal cycle (three years) in which to perform necessary alterations to bring the equipment into compliance. Gas fired installations which cannot achieve a combustion efficiency of at least 80 percent will have one renewal cycle (three years) in which to perform necessary alterations to bring the equipment into compliance.

   (3) When the boiler is fired at 80 to 110 percent of the burner's maximum operational oil/gas delivery rate as specified in the application, provided that this is less than the burner's maximum design oil/gas delivery rate, the maximum acceptable smoke reading must be smoke spot no. 3 in accordance with ASTM International Standard D2156-09.

   (4) When the boiler is fired at 80 to 110 percent of the burner's maximum operational oil/gas delivery rate as specified in the application, provided that this is less than the burner's maximum design oil/gas delivery rate), the installation must be capable of providing adequate pressure differential (e.g., draft) at conditions specified in subdivision (e) of this section.

   (5) For installations which have low-high-low-off or modulating combustion controls, adherence to the requirements in paragraphs (a)(1) and (2), listed above, must also be demonstrated when the burner is fired at low-fire. For installations which utilize modulating combustion controls, the department requires and reserves the right to verify that the performance requirements in paragraphs (a)(1) and (2), listed above, are also met at intermediate firing rates.

   (6) For multiple boiler installations the requirements in paragraphs (a)(1), (2), (3) and (4), listed above, must be demonstrated for each boiler when said boilers are operated simultaneously rather than individually when there is sufficient load demand from the premise. However, each boiler in a multiple boiler installation, when fired separately (i.e., all other boilers are shut down), must also meet these requirements and the department reserves the right to verify same.

   (7) In no case must the flame impinge on any interior surface within the furnace.

(b) Preparation for performance tests. In order to facilitate implementation of the performance test by the department's engineer, provision must be made by the installer, sufficiently in advance of the scheduled inspection, such that:

   (1) Continuous, uninterrupted operation of the boiler at 80 to 110 percent of the burner's maximum operational oil/gas delivery rate as specified in the application, provided that this is less than the burner's maximum design oil/gas delivery rate, for a minimum period of twenty minutes is insured. Under no circumstances must the boiler pressure relief valve(s) be tampered with to accomplish this.

   (2) Two 3/8 inch diameter holes are provided in the breeching, approximately 4 inches apart and placed so that the one closest to the boiler is approximately one breeching diameter downstream from the boiler outlet. Since these holes must be used for the measurement of boiler outlet gas temperature, percentage of O
									2
									 and smoke reading, it is important that they be placed in the system such that air infiltration from a barometric damper, smoke alarm port, etc., does not affect the composition of the combustion gases.

   (3) Two 3/8 inch diameter holes are provided in the breeching placed one on each side of any power operated draft regulator damper, approximately one breeching diameter from the centerline of the damper. Note that the location of one or both of these holes may, of necessity, be in the boiler outlet.

   (4) All test holes are a minimum of one breeching diameter from any flow disturbance such as a bend, expansion or contraction.

   (5) Any insulation is neatly removed from approximately a 4" × 4" area surrounding any test hole in the breeching.

   (6) All test holes are kept closed with a sheet metal screw or other acceptable method when not being used for testing purposes. All test holes must be marked in such a way that their location can be readily determined.

(c) Performance test equipment. All test data obtained during the performance test must be recorded on a form provided by the department.

(d) Procedure for performance tests. The following is an outline of the procedure which must be used to obtain data necessary for evaluating the performance of an installation and determining whether it meets the requirements specified in subdivision (a), above.

   (1) Verify that all conditions in the boiler room are characteristic of proper operating conditions (i.e., boiler room door is shut, non-fixed ventilation sources such as windows are shut, etc.).

   (2) The burner must be started up and operated at 80 to 110 percent of the burner maximum operational oil/gas delivery rate as specified in the application, provided that this is less than the burner's maximum design oil/gas delivery rate, depending on the demand load throughout the sequence of steps specified in paragraph (4) below.

   (3) The probe(s) of the testing equipment must be inserted into the test holes provided at the required locations.

   (4) Commencing after burner startup, boiler outlet gas temperature must be read at one minute intervals until the difference between two successive readings is not greater than 5°F at which time steady state conditions will be assumed and the following data must be obtained and recorded:

      (i) The boiler outlet gas temperature must be determined. In addition, the ambient air boiler room temperature in the vicinity of the burner must be determined.

      (ii) The percent oxygen (O
									2
									) in the flue gas must be determined.

      (iii) The pressure differential across the damper of a power operated draft regulator must be determined. This is not applicable to condensing boilers.

         (A) The pressure differential measurements and the gas temperature and outside ambient air temperature measurements must be used to determine whether adequate pressure differential (e.g., draft) can be provided when outside ambient air temperature is 94F.

         (B) When a power operated draft regulator is used, the pressure differential measured across the damper must be equal to or greater than the value obtained when the height of the stack (H) is multiplied by ΔDr/H, i.e.

            ΔP ≥ H × (ΔDr/H)

            where,

               ΔP (inches H
									2
									O) is the pressure differential measured across the power operated draft regulator damper.

               ΔDr/H (inches H
									2
									O/ft) is the differential draft per foot obtained from Table I using the outside ambient temperature measured when the performance test was conducted.

               H (feet) is the height of the stack.

         (C) When a barometric or manual damper is used, the theoretical pressure differential caused by the barometric or manual damper must be equal to or greater than the value obtained when the height of the stack is multiplied by ΔDr/H, i.e.

            ΔP ≥ H × (ΔDr/H)

            where ΔP, ΔDr/H, and H are defined in (B).

The static pressure is measured at the boiler outlet. The barometric damper or manual damper is gradually opened until the calculated DP is measured. The barometric damper is then returned to its original setting and the manual damper is then returned to its initial position and fixed. The department will review alternative demonstrations of adequate pressure differential if they comply with 2009 ASHRAE Fundamentals Chapter 21, and are stamped by a professional engineer.

   (5) The smoke reading must be determined and recorded in accordance with ASTM D2156 (2009).

   (6) For boilers which have low-high-low-off or modulating controls, upon completion of the above sequence of steps, the burner firing rate must be changed to low-fire for all boilers with a maximum heat input rating greater than 4.2 million Btu per hour.

   (7) Dual-fuel burners will be tested separately for oil and gas on high fire and on low-fire if the maximum heat input rating is greater than 4.2 million Btu per hour.

   (8) For multiple boiler installations, all boilers must be started up and operated simultaneously at 80 to 110 percent of their respective maximum operational oil/gas delivery rates as specified in the application, provided that this is less than the burner's maximum design oil/gas delivery rate, and the boiler outlet gas temperature, boiler room ambient air temperature, percentage of O
									2
									, smoke reading, and pressure differential must be determined for each boiler. The burner firing rates for all boilers must then be changed to their respective low-fire firing rates, and the boiler outlet gas temperature, boiler room ambient air temperature, percentage of O
									2
									 in the flue gas, and smoke reading, must be determined for each boiler at this firing rate.

(e) Evaluation. The boiler outlet gas temperature, boiler room air temperature, percentage of O
									2
									 in the flue gas, draft measurement, and smoke reading data must be used to determine whether the installation meets the minimum performance requirements for combustion efficiency, adequate reserve draft and smoke reading.






*§ 2-09 Annual Tune-ups and Record Keeping Requirements.* ::


An owner of equipment that is required to have a certificate of operation must perform annual tune-ups and combustion tests. Records of the dates and procedures of each tune-up and results of these tests must be kept by the owner for a minimum of five years and must be submitted within five business days if requested by the department.

(a) Annual equipment tune-ups and combustion efficiency test.

   (1) The owner of the equipment must commission a tune-up for the equipment and test the combustion efficiency. The tune-up and combustion efficiency test must occur at both high-fire and normal operating conditions.

      (i) A qualified combustion tester must perform a combustion efficiency test for each piece of equipment and each oil fired boiler in accordance with 15 RCNY § 2-08(a)(1).

      (ii) The tune-up required to increase boiler efficiency must be conducted in accordance with Subpart JJJJJJ of Part 63 of Title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations and the guidelines outlined by the department. The results of the tune-up must be recorded on a form provided by the department.

(b) Combustion Analyzer Requirements.

   (1) The combustion efficiency test must be performed using a qualified combustion analyzer that has passed an annual calibration test. The results of the annual calibration test must be kept and be submitted within five business days if requested by the department. If the minimum combustion efficiencies are not achieved, it is the responsibility of the owner to ensure proper maintenance and repairs occur.

   (3) The following procedure must be followed in the use of the combustion analyzer:

      (i) Set up the combustion analyzer per manufacturer's instructions. In uncontaminated air (outdoor) start the analyzer and allow unit to complete the zeroing process. Never allow the analyzer to zero in the breeching.

      (ii) Verify that the combustion analyzer condensate/water trap plug/access is properly sealed, that there is no water in the water trap, and thermocouple tip is not touching the side of probe tube. The test and record measurement criteria must be provided on a form prescribed by the department.

(c) This section applies to registrations that are subject to the requirements of 15 RCNY § 2-01.








*§ 2-10 [Reserved]* ::


(a) General considerations.

   (1) All equipment and apparatuses, in addition to complying with the requirements of the department, must also meet the requirements of other agencies, such as the New York City Board of Standards and Appeals, the Fire Department of New York, and the New York City Department of Buildings. Compliance with any requirements of either New York State or federal rules and regulations that may be instituted and not covered here is required. In the absence of any regulatory provisions, consideration must be given to recommendations published in the standards of nationally recognized organizations. These organizations include the American National Standards Institute, the American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air Conditioning Engineers, the American Society of Mechanical Engineers, the American Gas Institute, Underwriters' Laboratories, and the National Fire Protection Association, and the recommendations of equipment or apparatus manufacturers.

   (2) The design engineer must estimate the heat demand before selecting a boiler or boilers. When application is made for an installation for a new structure or for a replacement boiler (when the boiler maximum heat input rating size is increased by more than 20 percent from the previously filed application of record), the analysis and calculations for estimating the heat demand must be submitted in a form acceptable to the department. This must be done in accordance with the procedures prescribed by the 2009 ASHRAE Fundamentals Handbook, or as required for the New York City Energy Conservation Code, as codified in Chapter 10 of Title 28 of the New York City Administrative Code, and as accepted by the department.

   (3) For dual-fuel installations using #6 or #4 fuel oil as a back-up fuel for natural gas, design requirements set forth by the department must be followed. However, these installations must still meet the #2 fuel oil emission standards and must be held to the most recent performance requirements.

(b) Fuel burners.

   (1) An oil burner must be capable of atomizing the oil by properly mixing it with adequate combustion air. A gas-fired burner must be capable of mixing the gas with adequate combustion air.

   (2) A new burner must be listed by UL, CSA Group, ETL, or any other national recognized testing laboratory that uses UL testing conditions and have their Listing Mark label.

   (3) A new burner, except for atmospheric equipment, must have, integral with it, a fan which is capable of supplying all combustion air.

   (4) A burner must be sized such that, when fired with a boiler, the fuel delivery rate is within 80 percent and 110 percent of the maximum heat input rating of the boiler.

(c) Fresh Air Requirements.

   (1) Provision must be made to provide a sufficient amount of air for proper combustion (to the oil-or natural gas-burning equipment room) and, in addition, a sufficient amount of bypass air necessary for the proper operation of a barometric damper when used. In addition, sufficient air must be provided to adequately ventilate the room and maintain the ambient temperature at safe and comfortable limits under normal conditions of use. In all cases a separate ventilation system must be provided independent of any other ventilation system.

      (i) Mechanical ventilation must be designed such that 226 cfm @ 94F is provided for each million Btu per hour for up to 30 percent excess combustion air. Larger fan capacities would be needed for installations operating with greater than 30 percent excess combustion air. In all cases, where the combustion air is not ducted directly from the outside to the burner air intake, the room in which the burning equipment is located must be maintained at a pressure not less than outside atmospheric pressure. Exhaust fans are acceptable for ventilation provided the net ventilation is greater than or equal to the amount required for combustion.

      (ii) When mechanical ventilation is not utilized, the minimum requirement for combustion air entrance must be a louvered opening in a wall to the outside air. The louvered opening must have a net free area of 86 square inches for every one million Btu per hour (based on the maximum heat input rating) and must never be less than the average internal cross-sectional area of the chimney. In addition, the net free area of the louver must be increased in size equivalent to the opening of a barometric damper or dampers, when provided, for bypass air. When necessary, a metal grate over a vault below the sidewalk may be permitted as long as the net free area requirement is met and suitable drainage facilities are provided. The net free area when the actual louver efficiency is unknown must be based on a maximum efficiency of 60 percent for both motorized and fixed metal single vane louvers and 50 percent for fixed metal double vane louvers. Where the efficiency of the louver can be demonstrated by the manufacturer to be greater than the above, the greater value may be used. The area of the louver is to be based on the inside frame dimensions and not the outside or nominal dimensions. The louver must be so constructed or suitably located or protected (i.e., cinder blocks, metal bars) so that it cannot be crushed or deformed since this would diminish the free area. Furthermore, any reduction of free area due to protective devices must be considered. Screening over louvers, if provided, must be not smaller than 1/4 inch mesh and must be readily accessible for cleaning.

      (iii) When ducts are required to provide fresh air, they must meet the same minimum requirement for cross-sectional area as specified in subparagraph (ii) above. Note that a louver is not required where ducts are utilized to provide ventilation, although, consideration should be given to protective devices and any diminution of free area resulting from same. Access ports must be provided for the purpose of cleaning and observing conditions within the duct(s). All access ports must be ample size, but not less than 8 × 8 inches. A tight metal fitting cover must be provided for each port. All ports must be closed when not in use.

         (A) Access ports for cleanout must be located to allow accessibility to all duct sections and must be placed at intervals to allow for safe and reasonable access to all sections of the breeching for the purposes of cleaning. The number of clean-outs must be determined by the configuration of the duct lay-out. Every duct must be provided with at least one access port for cleanout.

         (B) Access ports for observation purposes must be provided within one diameter of all internal dampers.

         (C) One access port may be used to serve both functions if suitably located.

      (iv) Motorized louvers or motorized dampers in ducts must be provided, on installations where the maximum heat input rate of the boiler(s) is 7.0 million Btu per hour or greater which must close off the admission of combustion air during burner-off periods.

   (2) Breeching must be installed so as to vent the combustion gases from the boiler to the chimney.

      (i) Access ports must be provided for the purpose of cleaning and observing conditions within the breeching. All access ports must be of ample size but not less than 8 × 8 inches. A tight fitting metal cover must be provided for each port. All ports must be closed when not in use.

         (A) Access ports for the cleanout of oil burning installations must be located to allow accessibility to all breeching sections and must be placed at intervals to allow for safe and reasonable access to all sections of the breeching for the purposes of cleaning. The number of clean-outs must be determined by the configuration of the breeching lay-out. Every breeching must be provided with at least one access port for cleanout.

         (B) For short breeching runs (less than 15 feet in total), the barometric damper may be used as the clean-out port.

         (C) Access ports for observation purposes must be provided within one diameter of all internal motorized damper locations.

         (D) One access port may be used to serve both functions if suitably located.

      (ii) The following should be considered when designing a new breeching:

         (A) The equivalent inside diameter should normally be no smaller than the outlet of the boiler and should be sized on the basis of maintaining a flue gas velocity not greater than 30 feet per second.

         (B) Breechings should be as short and straight as possible to prevent unnecessary draft losses (which may necessitate larger chimneys, induced draft fans, etc.).

         (C) Breechings should be constructed so that changes in direction, shape and cross-sectional area are accomplished separately. All such changes should be accomplished as gradually as possible to eliminate turbulence with consequent adverse effects on available draft. If the width of breeching is greater than the inside width of the chimney, a contoured transition piece should be installed. The transition section should maintain the area of the breeching while altering its configuration so as not to exceed the chimney width.

         (D) The breeching connection to the chimney should be such that it ends flush with the inside surface of the chimney.

   (3) Chimneys must be designed and installed so as to vent the products of combustion to the atmosphere while at the same time avoiding a potential or actual nuisance. Chimneys must not be fitted with raincaps or covers of any kind.

      (i) New chimneys or reconstructed chimneys must be of tight construction and must be provided with a cleanout chamber at the base. The chamber must have a horizontal cross-sectional area equal to that of the chimney and must be equipped with a tightly fitted metal door of ample size but not less than 8 × 8 inches. The bottom of the breeching must be located at least one chimney diameter above the base of the cleanout chamber. Factory-made chimneys and special gas vents must be installed per the manufacturer's specifications.

(d) Control devices.

   (1) A boiler must be provided with acceptable control device(s) so as to maintain the desired boiler output under all normal operating conditions to meet the minimum performance requirements described in 15 RCNY § 2-08.

   (2) A burner must be provided with acceptable control device(s) so as to maintain the desired fuel-air ratio under all normal operating conditions to assure complete and smokeless combustion.

   (3) The burner control system must be permanently interlocked, unless the system is continuously staffed and supervised, with all ventilation fans, motorized louvers and dampers to prevent operation of the burner without the proper operation of the fan, louver, or damper. This must be accomplished with an air switch, or other approved means, to assure that the fan is operating or that the louver/damper has opened before the main fuel valve opens. This requirement does not prohibit operating fans and opening louvers or dampers for ventilation purposes during periods when the burner(s) are not in operation, although continuous, uninterrupted operation of the fan, independent of the burner, must not be permitted except for existing central ventilation systems.

   (4) Provision must be made, concerning the burner fan, to cause minimum pre-purge and post-purge periods as recommended by the burner manufacturer to prevent accumulation of unburned oil.

(e) Draft Regulators.

   (1) All installations must be designed such that an adequate draft can be maintained to provide sufficient combustion air and remove the products of combustion under normal conditions of use or when the outside temperature varies between 11°F and 94°F.

   (2) Power operated draft regulators must be of an acceptable type designed to maintain a safe damper opening at all times and arranged to prevent starting of the burner unless the damper is opened to a safe position. The damper must be sized so that it comprises the full cross-sectional area of the breeching with appropriate allowances for clearance. Upon shut-down of the burner the damper must go to a safe closed position. The axis-rod (i.e., control rod) about which the damper rotates must have a square cross section or if round, must be welded to the control arm. An arrow must be provided on the axis-rod to indicate the position of the damper.

   (3) Draft sensing lines must be a minimum of 1 1/4 inch pipe size, installed through the furnace wall, provided with a full size cleanout plug, and must otherwise conform to the equipment manufacturer's specifications. Details concerning the length and diameter of the draft sensing lines must be shown on the plans or specified in the plan notes.

   (4) Barometric dampers must be of an acceptable type designed so as to provide a constant draft at a point directly upstream of the barometric damper under all normal operating conditions or when the outside temperature varies between 11°F and 94°F. However, in no case under steady state conditions must a pressure exist in the breeching at the barometric damper which is greater than the boiler room pressure. The minimum cross-sectional opening of the barometric damper must be at least as large as the diameter or equivalent diameter of the breeching to which it is connected.

   (5) A draft control must not be required where an acceptable boiler assembly is designed and installed according to the manufacturer's requirements, and a positive pressure exists at a location in the chimney within three diameters of the chimney outlet.

   (6) A boiler must be provided with acceptable control device(s) so as to maintain adequate draft (positive or negative as required) necessary for proper gas flow both to supply sufficient combustion air and exhaust combustion gases under all normal load and atmospheric conditions.

      (i) A separate draft control must be provided for each boiler and be of the same type and must be installed per the manufacturer's specifications.

      (ii) Draft control must be accomplished by a power operated draft regulator with low-draft cut-off. A barometric damper may be substituted for a power operated draft regulator if

         (A) an on-off or low-high-off with low-fire start combustion controller is used or

         (B) a forced draft burner is used.

   (7) Oil-fired equipment, including dual-fuel installations, must be provided with a smoke alarm and combustion shutoff. This equipment must conform to the following specifications as well as applicable sections of the Air Pollution Control Code: The requirements of the above paragraph must not apply to a temperature controlled dual-fuel system (as set forth below) when the maximum heat input rate is less than 4.2 million Btu per hour. A temperature controlled dual-fuel system must comprise a fuel burning installation capable of burning natural gas and #2 fuel oil. The system must be designed and must operate such that the fuel burned will normally be gas except that when the outdoor temperature drops below 20°F, the equipment will automatically switch to #2 fuel oil and when the outdoor temperature rises above 25°F, the equipment will automatically return to natural gas operation.

      (i) The smoke alarm must be regulated for both brightness intensity of the light source and sensitivity of the detector. It is recommended that the light source have a relatively uniform intensity over a reasonably long life.

      (ii) The smoke alarm must cause both an audible (loud enough to be heard 20 feet from the source) and readily visible (a flashing red light) signal upon the emission of an air contaminant of an opacity of 20 percent or greater.

      (iii) The smoke alarm must activate an additional signaling device located at the principal work location of the person supervising the equipment. If there is no principal work location, the additional signaling device must be located at an acceptable alternate location outside the boiler room.

      (iv) The smoke alarm must cause the signaling devices to be activated in the event that the light source in a photoelectric type detector fails to operate properly. The signals must continue until the unit is manually reset.

      (v) The smoke alarm must be provided with a suitable metal grid or equivalent, which meets the manufacturer's recommendations, calibrated so that when placed in the light path of the detector it will cause a response equivalent to an air contaminant as described in subparagraph (ii) above. This calibration must be indicated on the grid holder or frame. This grid must be securely fastened by means of a welded link chain of suitable length to the body of the detector. Provision must be made to temporarily hang the grid in front of the sensing element of the detector to facilitate proper adjustment of the light source and calibration of the instrument.

      (vi) The installation of the smoke alarm must be such that

         (A) it is wired to function at all times and

         (B) it includes means necessary for sealing the breeching to prevent blowout of combustion products when necessary.

      (vii) If two or more units of equipment are connected to a single flue, one air contaminant detector may be used if installed to monitor all of the units. This arrangement, however, will result in the shut-down of all units of equipment upon activation of the combustion shutoff.

      (viii) The combustion shutoff automatically halt the operation of equipment within two minutes of continuous emission of an air contaminant of a density which appears as dark or darker than 20 percent opacity, unless the system is continuously staffed and supervised. The combustion shutoff must be designed such that once it has been activated, the equipment cannot resume normal operation without manual reset.








*§ 2-12 [Reserved]* ::


Several factors affect the location of the chimney outlet including the need to avoid a potential or actual nuisance. The following applicable requirements must be met.

(a) For all new installations (new building or new chimney):

   (1) The chimney must extend above all construction such as roof ridge, parapet wall, penthouse, roof tank, elevator enclosure, etc., as follows:

      (i) Chimneys must extend at least 3 feet above said construction located within 10 feet of the chimney outlet.

   (2) The chimney outlet must not be located within the minimum radial distance specified in Table II.

(b) For existing installations:

   (1) The chimney must extend at least as high as all construction such as roof ridge, parapet wall, penthouse, roof tank, elevator enclosure, etc., within 10 feet of the chimney outlet.

   (2) The chimney outlet must not be located within the minimum radial distance specified in Table II. Such requirement must apply to receptors which are at a height equal to or greater than the chimney outlet.

      For receptors located below the chimney outlet, the chimney outlet must not be located within the minimum radial distance specified in Table II.

      In those instances where the above is applicable, the following statement must be provided as a plan note in place of the statement required in 15 RCNY § 2-04(c)(2)(iv) - (vi): "The minimum radial distance from the centerline of the existing chimney to an acceptable receptor location (a) located at a height equal to or greater than the chimney outlet is ________ ft. and (b) located below the chimney outlet is ________ ft.," with the distance specified.

(c) Whenever a building is erected, enlarged, or increased in height so that any receptor location in such building is within the minimum radial distance, as specified in Table II, of any previously constructed chimneys, the owner of such new or altered building must have the responsibility of altering such chimneys to make them conform with subdivision (a) of this section above. This must not apply to chimneys no longer connected to combustion equipment.

(d) 1) The criteria employed in determining stack heights and chimney outlet to receptor distance in this section must only apply to off-site receptors.

   (2) Receptors, sources and geometry with the following features will be considered on-site and not subject to 15 RCNY § 2-13.

      (i) A single boiler stack servicing a single building structure.

      (ii) Contiguous construction (i.e., attached "row" houses).

      (iii) Separate entrances with separate addresses all serviced by the same boiler room.

   (3) This section will be applied to existing facilities to the maximum extent possible consistent with good engineering practices. Alternative and less costly options to altering the stack should be permitted if it can be shown that this will not cause degradation of boiler performance. Degradation of boiler performance would increase air pollutant emissions or inhibit compliance with boiler upgrading criteria.

   (4) For new and existing chimneys, emission impacts upon sensitive receptors including, but not limited to, windows, doors that open, people, and building fresh air intakes must be minimized by employing good air pollution control engineering practices. Such practices include, without limitation:

      (i) Avoiding locations that may be subject to downwash of the exhaust; and

      (ii) Installing stacks of sufficient height in locations that will prevent and minimize flue gas impacts upon sensitive receptors.

   (5) Since this chapter's tables were developed using assumed average meteorological conditions in New York City, situations being disputed may be resolved by the submission of individualized computations of pollutant concentration at the receptor using realistic and applicable factors in dispersion models recommended and approved by the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation and the federal Environmental Protection Agency. The modeling must show that National Ambient Air Quality Standards will not be exceeded at any sensitive receptors, including openable windows and fresh air intakes. The tests, modeling, analysis and costs for these study(s) must be the responsibility of the applicant.

"Tunneling" shall be defined as any activity to construct a tunnel carried out by tunneling methods, i.e., mining, boring, jacking, lining, shielding, and where the above methods are not practical, cut and cover shall also be considered a tunneling method. Tunneling does not include cut and cover operations for the installation of minor utility lines by cut and cover methods. In order to obtain a permit for shaft and tunnel construction the applicant shall submit an application to the Division of Noise Abatement for use in determining after completion the conditions necessary to conform to the New York City Noise Control Code. The tunnel permit shall be issued for each shaft site to cover the operation and hours of use of all equipment. The applicant will be required to submit an application completed in full. It is intended that the permit will be applicable for the site and equipment therein designated. Should there by any change of conditions, location or equipment substitution, the Division of Noise Abatement must be notified and the appropriate specifications of the permit modified.




Chapter 8: Industrial Equipment
--------------------------------------------------



*§ 8-01 Submission of Environmental Rating Reports from Industrial Sources.* ::


Environmental Rating Reports are required for every industrial process capable of emitting solid, liquid or gaseous contaminants to the open air, and are required regardless of when the equipment became operational. The Department requires that all operational industrial equipment, as defined in § 24-104(25) of the Administrative Code, in New York City submit an Environmental Rating Report pursuant to § 24-154 of the Code. The Environmental Rating Report is required to contain substantive information showing that the equipment is being operated in compliance with § 24-153 of the Code. The Environmental Rating Reports must be filed with the Bureau of Air Resources when specifically requested by the Bureau, and/or upon application for renewal of a Certificate of Operation if an Environmental Rating Report was not previously submitted. In accordance with § 24-138 of the Code an administrative fee must be submitted with the Environmental Rating Report. No fee is required if the Report is filed in support of an application for an operating certificate. Environmental Rating Reports are not required for oil or gas burners and boilers, unit space heaters, and exhausts used for comfort heating, ventilating and air conditioning systems. Any owner or operator who is unsure whether an Environmental Rating Report should be filed should complete and submit Form AR 510 to the Bureau of Air Resources. No fee is required when filing Form AR 510. The Bureau of Air Resources will notify the owner or operator within 60 days of filing Form AR 510 if an Environmental Rating Report must be submitted.




Chapter 9: Gas Fired Burner Installations
--------------------------------------------------



*§ 9-01 Installation of and Conversion to Gas or Gas/Oil Fired Burners.* ::


(a) For those installations where it is necessary to install a new gas or gas/oil burner then a complete new filing will be required.

(b) For those installations for which the Department of Environmental Protection has an application to use oil as a fuel and a decision is made to convert to straight gas, an amendment to the filing is required which must show compliance with subdivision (e) of this section.

(c) For those installations for which the Department has an application to use oil as a fuel and a decision is made to convert to a combination of oil and gas, and amendment to the active filing is all that is required provided the burner is accepted for both gas and oil firing. It should be understood that the installation will be required to meet the Engineering Criteria for Oil Burning Equipment for the grade of oil being used.

(d) For those installations which have a valid Certificate of Operation under current criteria for fuel oil and a decision is made to convert to straight gas or gas and oil and the burner for which the Certificate of Operation was issued is accepted for burning gas or gas and oil, than an amendment to the original application will suffice to document the change in the grade of fuel. It should be noted however, that in those cases where oil is burned in combination with gas, that the grade of oil must be the same or a lighter grade than that for which the Certificate of Operation was issued.

(e) In all of the above cases, it will be the responsibility of the filing engineer to advise the owner that an appropriate filing is required in the Department of Buildings. A copy of the Letter of Completion from the Building Department must be submitted. Same will be accepted in lieu of burner labeling by Underwriters Laboratories and will not require inspection by the Bureau of Air Resources with reference to modification on burner, but we may require inspection on the boiler for compliance with Chapter 2 of these Rules. There will be no requirement to update the UL label to indicate oil/gas operation.

(f) Whenever an application is filed for natural gas, the application will be required to meet the criteria in effect on June 30, 1973 (Chapter 2 of these Rules).* Where this criteria refers to natural gas, the specific requirements for natural gas will be used, in all other cases, the requirements for number 2 fuel oil will be used on an equivalent BTU basis as has been the policy in the past.

**Subchapter B: Use of Best Available Technology and Ultra Low Sulfur Diesel Fuel**



*§ 14-02 Best Available Technology Determination.* ::


An engine that has been certified to meet the United States Environmental Protection Agency's ("EPA") Tier IV Exhaust Emission Standards is deemed to be using the Best Available Technology ("BAT"), and does not require additional retrofit technologies. EPA's Tier IV Exhaust Emission Standards are described in Table 1 of the EPA`s Clean Air Nonroad Diesel Rule Fact Sheet, EPA420-F-04-032, May 2004, available at http://www.epa.gov/nonroaddiesel/2004fr/420f04032.htm. If an engine has not been certified to meet the Tier IV Exhaust Emission Standards, pursuant to § 24-163.3 of the Administrative Code, the BAT that must be utilized is one of the following, provided, that this technology shall achieve the greatest reduction in emissions of particulate matter and shall in no event result in an increase in the emissions of either particulate matter or nitrogen oxides:

Category I (a) Any properly installed and functioning system utilizing a Diesel Particulate Filter ("DPF") that primarily reduces emissions of particulate matter ("PM"), demonstrating an 85% or greater reduction in PM, and secondarily nitrogen oxide ("NOx") that appears on either the United States Environmental Protection Agency ("EPA") or the California Air Resources Board ("CARB") verified lists at http://www.epa.gov/otaq/retrofit/verif-list.htm and http://www.arb.ca.gov/diesel/verdev/background.htm for onroad or nonroad engines.

Category I (b) Any properly installed DPF from either the EPA or CARB verified lists.

Category I(c) A filter that has undergone the Verminderung der Emissionen Realer Dieselmotoren im Tunnelbau ("VERT") test procedure and appears as approved for continuous use on the VERT list maintained by http://akpf.org/pub/vert__filterliste.pdf or similar test procedures to those conducted by EPA/CARB and has demonstrated an 85% or greater reduction in emissions of PM.

Category II Any properly installed and functioning system utilizing a Flow through Filer ("FTF") that primarily reduces emissions of particulate matter ("PM") and secondarily nitrogen oxide ("NOx") that appears on either the verified lists for onroad or nonroad engines or any properly installed FTF on the verified list and that produces the greater PM reduction but not less than a 50% reduction in PM.

Category III Any properly installed and functioning system utilizing a Diesel Oxidation Catalyst ("DOC") or any emulsified diesel fuel that appears on either the EPA or CARB verified lists for onroad or nonroad engines that produces not less than a 25% reduction in FM. Fuel technologies must be compatible with the use of ultra low sulfur diesel fuel.






*§ 14-03 Method of Best Available Technology Selection.* ::


(a)  Any contractor or agency operating a type of nonroad vehicle must select the appropriate BAT for use with such type of nonroad vehicle. For each type of nonroad vehicle subject to the BAT requirement, the contractor or agency operating such type of vehicle must identify, in list form, all types of pollution control technology devices that qualify as BAT in Category I for such nonroad vehicle.

(b) All types of pollution control technology devices identified by the contractor or agency as Category I (a) BAT that are not technologically feasible for use with the subject type of nonroad vehicle are to be eliminated from the list of Category I (a) BAT. To eliminate a specific type of pollution control technology or individual device, the contractor or agency must demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Commissioner and document that operational constraints or physical, chemical or engineering principles preclude the successful and effective use of the nonroad vehicle when used with the specific pollution control technologies of that type. The contractor or agency shall then consider DPFs that satisfy the requirements set forth in Category I(b). If use of a Category I(b) DPF is technologically feasible, the contractor or agency must notify the Commissioner of the selection and the installation schedule. If none are technologically feasible, the contractor or agency shall select the technology devices set forth in Category I(c).

(c) If, after the elimination process, no technologies remain in Category I (a), (b), or (c) from which the contractor or agency can select a BAT, the contractor or agency shall apply for Approval of a Written Finding of Unavailbility. Upon approval by the DEP, the same identification and elimination process shall be done for Category II. If, after the elimination process, no technologies remain in Category II from which the contractor or agency can select a BAT, the same identification and elimination process shall be done for Category III. If, after the elimination process, no technologies remain in Category III from which the contractor or agency can select a BAT, the contractor or agency operating the subject nonroad vehicle shall apply for an Approval of a Written Finding of Unavailability or a Safety Waiver.

(d) Once a category is selected as provided for in (c) above, an economic impact analysis is to be performed on the remaining technologies if the technology reduces both PM and NOx. If the cost of the technology that provides NOx control is equal to or greater than thirty percent more than that of the technology without NOx control, then the technology without NOx control shall be selected. For the purpose of this paragraph, the criteria that shall be considered is the cost of the strategies, themselves and the cost of installation.

(e) For newly purchased vehicles, BAT may be Original Equipment Manufacturer ("OEM") installed control technology, provided that the technology is selected in a manner such that it provides the greatest reduction in particulate matter above the PM standard that the EPA has certified without increasing NOx and that reduction is verified by the manufacturer. The BAT need not be on EPA or CARB verified retrofit lists.

(f) The contractor or agency must use the pollution control technology identified as BAT by the process set forth in this subchapter.

(g) Prior to the installation of the selected technology, the contractor or agency shall notify the DEP of the BAT selection and contact the DEP when the DPF or other BAT is installed pursuant to this chapter and § 24-163.3 of the Administrative Code. The contractor or agency shall make arrangements to have the unit inspected and registered and the DEP shall label the vehicle as compliant. The contractor shall retain all documentation generated in the BAT selection process for as long as the selected BAT is in use. A contractor's failure to fully document the selection process or to provide such documentation shall be considered a violation of subdivision e of § 24-163.3 and is subject to applicable penalties.






*§ 14-04 Best Available Technology Selection Applicability.* ::


(a)  The BAT listed in this subchapter may be amended, superseded, or repealed at any time. However, no contractor or agency will be required to replace a selected BAT within three years of first using such BAT on any nonroad vehicle.

(b) A contractor or agency who is using a DPF that does not appear on the EPA or CARB verified lists may use such DPF for three years from the date it was first installed. After such three-year period, if such DPF does not appear on either the EPA or CARB verified lists, such DPF may not be used in nonroad vehicles used in City projects.

(c) A contractor or agency who is using Category I(c) technology may use such technology for three years from the date it was first installed. After such three-year period, if such technology does not appear on either the EPA or CARB verifid lists, such technology may not be used in nonroad vehicles used in City projects.

(d) A contractor or agency that has installed technology that appears on either the EPA and/or CARB verified lists at the time of installation, but which has been removed from the EPA and/or CARB verified lists during the thirty months following installation, may not use such technology in nonroad vehicles used in City projects at the conclusion of the three-year period following installation. A contractor or agency that has installed technology that appears on the EPA and/or CARB verified lists at the time of installation, but which has been removed from the EPA and/or CARB verified lists during the six months preceding the conclusion of the three-year period following installation, or at any time after the conclusion of such three-year period, may use such technology in nonroad vehicles for an additional six months following the date it was removed from the EPA and/or CARB verified lists.






*§ 14-05 Use of Ultra Low Sulfur Diesel Fuel.* ::


All nonroad vehicles subject to this rule must be powered by ultra low sulfur diesel fuel, regardless of which BAT is selected, unless the Commissioner has issued a written determination pursuant to subdivision i of § 24-163.3 permitting the use of diesel fuel that has a sulfur content of no more than thirty parts per million.






*§ 14-06 Public Works Contracts.* ::


Any contractor acting pursuant to a public works contract that is subject to the provisions of paragraph four of subdivision f of § 24-163.3, but not paragraph one or three of such subdivision, shall comply with this subchapter and subchapters A and C of this chapter as of June 19, 2005.

*§ 17-08 Damage to Persons or Property.* ::


(a)  The permittee shall indemnify and save the City harmless from all damages resulting from injury to persons or property arising from the use of City land, structures or other property under this Permit. Insurance policies naming the City, together with its officials and employees and the New York City Water Board as additional insureds must be provided as follows:

   •   All individuals and Not-for-Profit Organizations: Personal or General Liability or Homeowners' Insurance with minimum limits of $500,000;

   •   All Commercial entities: Commercial General Liability Insurance with minimum limits of $2,000,000 per occurrence, $5,000,000 aggregate;

   •   All Utilities and Municipalities: Commercial General Liability Insurance with minimum limits of $2,000,000 per occurrence, $5,000,000 aggregate.

In lieu of such insurance policies, municipal permittees may provide proof of self-insurance in an amount satisfactory to DEP and municipal and Commercial entities may provide other forms of undertakings, such as, but not limited to, letters of credit in amounts satisfactory to DEP. All permittees must provide proof of insurance, self-insurance or other undertaking annually.

(b) The permittee shall be required to furnish a surety bond in a minimum amount of $250,000 in favor of the City of New York to be continued during the period that City property is occupied by the permittee for siting major improvements or infrastructure, including, but not limited to, the following:

     •     pump stations,

     •     filtration plants, and

     •     other improvements of a similar nature.

The purpose of such bond is to cover the cost of any repairs or remediation necessitated by the permittee's use of City property or for removal of permittee's improvements remaining on City property after Permit revocation or termination and restoration of the property to its original conditions after such removal. Such bond shall be continued in force by the permittee until City property is cleared of all encumbrances placed there by permittee and shall not limit in any way the liability of the permittee for damage to life or property resulting from the use or occupancy of City property.

(c) In the event any City infrastructure or lands are damaged by the permittee's use of City property, DEP will determine, based on the nature and location of the damage, whether DEP or the permittee will perform such repair. Regardless of whether DEP or the permittee performs such repairs, the permittee shall be responsible for any and all costs for such repairs to the satisfaction of DEP. If DEP allows the permittee to undertake such repairs, failure to complete these repairs to the satisfaction of DEP may result in revocation of the Permit and any additional legal remedies available to DEP.

(d) In case of emergency, insurance verification must be submitted to DEP within ten (10) business days of the date of emergency Permit issuance.






*§ 17-09 Revocation.* ::


Permits are revocable at the will of the Commissioner upon thirty (30) days' written notice of the proposed revocation, except in the case of emergencies that present immediate risks to water quality, City infrastructure(s) or to the health of employees or members of the public. Reasons for revocation include, but are not limited to, the following:

•    violation by the permittee of any regulation or condition(s) of the Permit,

•    failure to pay Permit fees,

•    failure to maintain improvement or structure allowed by such Permit,

•    failure to provide proof of insurance, and

•     DEP's need to use its land for water supply operations.

Such revocation, other than for DEP's need to use its land for water supply purposes, may be cured by the permittee within the thirty (30) day written notice period. Failure by DEP to revoke a Permit shall not prohibit DEP from exercising any other legal remedies available.






*§ 17-10 Permittee's Improvements to be Removed and City Property Restored on Notice of Permit Revocation or Permit Termination.* ::


Upon Permit revocation, any improvements belonging to the permittee must be removed from City property, at the permittee's expense, within thirty (30) days of such revocation unless otherwise authorized by DEP in writing. The property must be restored by the permittee or DEP in accordance with 15 RCNY § 17-08(c) within thirty (30) days of revocation or as otherwise agreed upon. Any improvement(s) remaining on City property beyond thirty (30) days of the written notice shall be considered abandoned and title to such improvement(s) shall become vested in the City, at the City's option. Should the City elect to take title, the improvement(s) shall be disposed as the Commissioner may direct in lieu of any other procedure for the disposition of abandoned property required or permitted by law, and the former permittee waives any right to assert a claim against DEP pursuant to the provisions of the New York State Personal Property Law, Abandoned Property Law or any such other procedure. DEP shall seek reimbursement for any costs incurred for the removal of any such improvement(s) and shall also seek forfeiture of any bond provided.






*§ 17-11 Title of Property.* ::


Title and ownership of all City property, including all natural resources above, on and beneath the property, such as, but not limited to, minerals, soils, trees and metals upon, in or under the land shall remain and be vested in the City of New York. Removal of City resources from any Permitted location, unless approved in writing in advance by DEP, is strictly prohibited and will be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law.






*§ 17-12 Unenforceability.* ::


If any clause, sentence, paragraph, subdivision, section, rule or part of this chapter shall be adjudged by any court or competent jurisdiction to be invalid, such judgment shall not affect, impair or invalidate the remainder thereof, but shall be confined in its operation to the clause, sentence, paragraph, subdivision, section, rule or part thereof directly involved in the controversy in which such judgment shall have been rendered.






*§ 17-13 Repeal.* ::


These rules are intended to repeal those rules entitled Issuance of Temporary Permits for the Occupation of City Property, effective September 2, 2001; provided, however, that with respect to Permits issued before the effective date of these rules, all restrictions, conditions and requirements upon the permittee contained in the earlier rules shall remain in effect until such Permit is renewed, cancelled, terminated or revoked.




Chapter 18: Protection from Contamination, Degradation and Pollution of the New York City Water Supply and Its Sources
--------------------------------------------------




**Subchapter A: General Provisions**



*§ 18-11 Preface.* ::


(a)  The health, welfare and economic well-being of nearly nine million residents in the five counties of New York City ("the City"), and of an increasing number of upstate New York communities is inextricably tied to the quality of the source waters in the watersheds of the New York City Water Supply located in Westchester, Putnam, Dutchess, Delaware, Ulster, Greene, Sullivan and Schoharie Counties, and Fairfield County in Connecticut. The high quality of these waters faces a continuing threat from the cumulative and episodic impacts of pollution sources generated by certain land uses and activities in the watersheds. It is the duty of the Commissioner of the New York City Department of Environmental Protection (the "Department") to protect the high quality of waters from which the City's water supply is drawn and preserve it from degradation for the purpose of protecting the health and general welfare of its consumers.

(b) These rules and regulations repeal in their entirety and supersede the Rules and Regulations for the Department of Water Supply, Gas and Electricity of the City of New York enacted the 11th day of June, 1953.

(c) These rules and regulations are hereby enacted pursuant to the authority vested in the Commissioner of the Department of Environmental Protection, as set forth in 15 RCNY § 18-13.






*§ 18-12 Purpose and Findings.* ::


(a)  The quality of the drinking water supplied to the City and upstate communities which draw from the New York City water supply depends primarily on the quality of the source waters which feed the reservoirs. The source waters and reservoirs are vulnerable to degradation and contamination from various sources and activities, including, but not limited to:

   (1) Wastewater discharges to surface water and groundwater;

   (2) Urban, suburban, rural, mining, silvicultural and agricultural land use practices that result in nonpoint source runoff of pollution and/or in adverse changes in the natural rate at which water flows into and through a delineated drainage basin; and

   (3) Improper use, handling, storage, transport and/or disposal of substances, including but not limited to, hazardous substances, radioactive materials, pesticides, fertilizers, winter highway maintenance materials, solid wastes, and animal wastes.

(b) The Department finds that such sources and activities, either alone or in conjunction with any other related activities, may constitute a source of contamination to or degradation of the water supply, may cause a contravention of the State water quality standards set forth in 6 NYCRR Parts 701-705, and Subchapter D of these rules and regulations, and may result in the impairment of the use of the water supply for drinking, culinary or food processing purposes.

(c) In response to the Safe Drinking Water Act Amendments of 1986, the United States Environmental Protection Agency has begun implementing a significant expansion of regulatory requirements for public water systems. In order to protect the public health, and to satisfy the legislative mandates of the Safe Drinking Water Act Amendments and the rules and regulations in 40 C.F.R. Parts 141 and 142, the New York State Department of Health has amended the State Sanitary Code, 10 NYCRR Part 5, Subpart 5-1, Public Water Systems, which contains New York State's Surface Water Treatment Rule. Although both Federal and State law propose filtration as a method for water quality treatment for pathogen control, the effectiveness of the filtration process and complexity of plant operation is dependent upon the quality of the water entering the filtration plant. In addition, many contaminants are not removed by conventional filtration. Therefore, it is clear that enhancement of the City's existing watershed rules and regulations would be necessary even if the City were to build filtration plants to filter its entire water supply.

(d) It is the goal and intent of these rules and regulations to protect the public health by averting future contamination to and degradation of the water supply and by remediating existing sources of pollution or degradation of the New York City water supply. These rules and regulations implement the Department's intention to minimize the discharge of pollutants into the source waters from both point and nonpoint sources, minimize the adverse impacts of erosion, limit the discharge of phosphorus to source waters which may accelerate the eutrophication process, and provide notification to the City of ongoing or proposed activities, which either alone or in conjunction with other existing and proposed regulated activities, may cause contamination to or degradation of the water supply.

(e) It is the purpose of these rules and regulations to insure compliance with the Federal and State standards by providing a comprehensive watershed protection program. Furthermore, these rules and regulations articulate an antidegradation policy for the New York City water supply system. These rules and regulations are promulgated to govern those activities in the watershed that threaten the quality of the water supply of the numerous upstate communities and the City of New York. While bound by its responsibility to protect the public health, the City has also taken the needs of the communities and businesses in the New York City watershed into consideration in drafting and promulgating these rules and regulations.

(f) The City reserves the right to re-examine these rules and regulations periodically to insure that they continue to further the goal and intent referred to in paragraph (d) of this subdivision and the purposes referred to in paragraph (e) of this subdivision. Without limiting the foregoing, and without limiting the City's rights to continue, modify, amend, suspend, waive or revoke any or all of these rules and regulations at any time in accordance with applicable law, the City intends to re-examine these rules and regulations ten (10) years after the effective date hereof to ascertain whether, and to what extent, these rules and regulations should be modified or amended so that they continue to serve their intended purposes.






*§ 18-13 Authority.* ::


These rules and regulations are promulgated pursuant to Article 11 of the New York State Public Health Law and § 24-302 of the New York City Administrative Code, and have been duly promulgated by the Commissioner of the Department of Environmental Protection of the City of New York and approved by the Commissioner of the New York State Department of Health. These rules and regulations shall become effective upon completion of any conditions set forth in the approval issued by the New York State Department of Health pursuant to § 1100(1) of the Public Health Law; publication of these rules and regulations pursuant to § 1100(2) of the Public Health Law; and upon completion of the requirements of the New York City Administrative Procedure Act.

**Subchapter B: Standards and Procedures For Regulated Activities and Noncomplying Regulated Activities**



*§ 18-21 Standards for Regulated Activities.* ::


(a)  The following general standards apply to all regulated activities unless specifically noted otherwise, whether or not the regulated activity also requires the review and approval of the Department. In addition, certain regulated activities must meet additional standards or procedures where specifically set forth in this subchapter or in other subchapters:

   (1) All regulated activities shall be planned, designed, scheduled and conducted in such manner as to not constitute a source of contamination to or degradation of the water supply.

   (2) The Department shall base its review and approval of any regulated activity on compliance with these rules and regulations, including the water quality standards set forth in Subchapter D, and shall additionally take into consideration the system specific water quality characteristics set forth in Appendix 18-B.

   (3) The burden of demonstrating compliance with the requirements of these rules and regulations shall be on the person proposing to engage in a regulated activity. In the event that any person finds that compliance with any standard set forth in these rules and regulations is not possible, then she or he may apply for a variance in accordance with the provisions of Subchapter F of these rules and regulations. Variances may be granted provided that the Department makes the findings required by Subchapter F of these rules and regulations.

   (4) Failure to comply with the conditions of any approval issued by the Department under these rules and regulations shall be a violation of these rules and regulations.

   (5) The Department may order that a regulated activity cease, and/or a facility where such regulated activity is taking place be closed or removed, if such regulated activity is causing contamination to or degradation of the water supply, such that the activity is a threat to the life, health, or safety of water supply users that requires immediate corrective action. Any person who receives such an order may request a hearing on such order in the manner provided in 15 RCNY § 18-29.






*§ 18-22 Procedures for Notification and/or Reporting.* ::


Where any notification, application or reporting to the Department required by these rules and regulations is to be made in writing, it shall be sent by certified mail to both the local Department representative in the portion of the watershed in which the regulated activity takes place and to the Engineering Section. Addresses are listed in 15 RCNY § 18-15.






*§ 18-23 Application Procedures and Requirements.* ::


(a)  These procedures shall apply to the following:

   (1) Applications for review and approval of regulated activities, including renewals of approvals of regulated activities. An application for renewal of an approval of a regulated activity shall be submitted to the Department no less than 180 days prior to the expiration of the approval. This deadline shall apply unless stated otherwise in a special condition of the approval.

   (2) Applications for review and approval of a substantial alteration or modification of any regulated activity;

   (3) Applications for review and approval of any substantial alteration or modification of a noncomplying regulated activity; and

   (4) Applications for variances pursuant to Subchapter F of these rules and regu- lations.

(b) The applicant shall meet the following requirements:

   (1) No person shall undertake any activity listed in 15 RCNY § 18-14 which requires the review and approval of the Department without first obtaining written approval from the Department, except where a temporary emergency approval has been obtained from the Department pursuant to 15 RCNY § 18-24.

   (2) Any person proposing to undertake any activity listed in 15 RCNY § 18-14 which requires the review and approval of the Department, shall submit to the Department, at the address of the Department representative for the area where the regulated activity is to be undertaken set forth in 15 RCNY § 18-15, an application for review and approval which includes a plan of the activity which meets the requirements of this Subchapter and any additional requirements for the specific activity set forth in these rules and regulations. Failure by the applicant to submit information to the Department or to follow the Department procedures set forth in these rules and regulations is sufficient grounds to deny the approval.

   (3) Any person seeking approval of an activity may be subject to such terms and conditions as the Department may require, including time limitations and limitations on transfer of the approval given by the Department.

   (4) (i)  An applicant shall affirmatively state in the application whether any enforcement action has been commenced during the five (5) years preceding the application against the applicant, or any principal or affiliate of the applicant, for alleged violations of law related to the specific regulated activity for which the approval is sought, or related to the facility or site at which the activity is located. The applicant shall supply the following information with respect to each enforcement action: the agency or entity commencing the action, the date of commencement, the facility location and address where the alleged violation occurred, and disposition of the action.

      (ii) Failure to fully and accurately disclose any material information required to be disclosed pursuant to subparagraph 4(i) shall be a basis for the Department to deny a permit application.

      (iii) Failure to cure any adjudicated violation of this Chapter or any law, rule or regulation enforced by the Department shall be a basis to deny a permit application.

      (iv) If the Department or the City has commenced an enforcement action against the applicant for violations of law related to the facility or site at which the activity for which the approval is sought is located, the Department may suspend processing of the application until such alleged violations are cured.

   (5) Any property owner may request that the Department perform a site visit and evaluation to determine and flag the presence of a watercourse, reservoir, reservoir stem or controlled lake on the owner's property. If the property owner supplies the Department with a surveyor's map of the property which includes a representation of the flagged watercourses, reservoirs, reservoir stems or controlled lakes identified by the Department, the Department shall confirm or annotate the findings upon the surveyor's map as soon as is practicable. A confirmed survey map shall be binding upon the Department for five years following the date of the confirmation.

   (6) If an applicant for Department review and approval of a regulated activity requests that the Department conduct a site visit and evaluation to determine and flag the presence of a watercourse, reservoir, reservoir stem or controlled lake on the applicant's property the Department shall do so as soon as is practicable. If the applicant supplies the Department with a surveyor's map of the property which includes a representation of the flagged watercourses, reservoirs, reservoir stems or controlled lakes identified by the Department, the Department shall confirm or annotate the findings upon the surveyor's map within 20 business days of receipt thereof. A confirmed survey map shall be binding upon the Department for five years following the date of the confirmation. The absence of a Department confirmed surveyor's map will not cause an application to be considered incomplete.

(c) An application shall contain the following information:

   (1) An application for the review and approval of any activity listed in 15 RCNY § 18-14 shall provide a description of the activity, the location and topography of the area of the activity, identification of any existing structures at the location, and any engineering, construction or other plans which detail the methods to be used in undertaking the activity such that it shall meet the requirements of this Subchapter and any additional requirements for the specific activity set forth in these rules and regulations.

   (2) An application for review and approval of any activity listed in 15 RCNY § 18-14 shall include a copy of any Environmental Assessment Form (EAF), and either a Draft Environmental Impact Statement (DEIS) or a determination of nonsignificance by the lead agency, where such documents are prepared pursuant to Article 8 of the Environmental Conservation Law and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder.

   (3) When a regulated activity requires a related approval from any other agency or more than one approval from the Department, the application for review and approval shall include a list of such approvals which the applicant knows to be required, and a statement of the status of any required approval at the time of filing of the application with the Department.

   (4) An application for review and approval of any regulated activity shall include the name, address, telephone number, and fax number of the applicant or the applicant's authorized representative, and of the design professional(s), if any, involved in preparing the application.

(d) Review and Approval Procedures:

   (1) The applicant proposing to engage in any activity listed in 15 RCNY § 18-14 which requires the review and approval of the Department shall certify in writing that she or he believes that the application is complete and in compliance with the requirements of this Subchapter and any additional requirements for the specific activity set forth in these rules and regulations.

   (2) An application is complete when it is determined by the Department to contain sufficient information for the purpose of commencing review of the application. The Department retains the right to seek additional information in order to enable the Department to make a determination pursuant to these rules and regulations. Within ten (10) days of receiving an application for review and approval of a conventional individual sewage treatment system to be installed on an individual lot which is not within a subdivision, or within twenty (20) days of receiving any other type of application for review or approval, the Department shall either:

      (i) Notify the applicant in writing that the application is complete and that the Department shall commence its review; or

      (ii) Notify the applicant in writing that the application is incomplete and specifically request all additional information from the applicant as the Department deems necessary. If additional information is requested or comments are issued by the Department that need to be addressed by the applicant, the twenty (20) day period described in paragraph (d)(4) of this subdivision or the forty-five (45) day period described in paragraph (d)(5) of this subdivision shall not commence to run. The Department shall notify the applicant in writing within ten (10) days of receiving the additional information that has been requested either that the application is complete and that the Department has commenced its review or that further information is required.

      (iii) Except in cases where the applicant has submitted false or misleading information or where a change in relevant law has occurred or changes have been proposed for the project, the Department may require further information based only upon the additional information submitted by the applicant or new issues raised by such information. In addition, the Department may also require further information based on a change in ownership of the property, the identity of the applicant, or the identity of the applicant's owners, principals, shareholders, directors, or officers.

   (3) If the Department fails to notify an applicant in writing of its determination as to the completeness or incompleteness of the application within the time periods set forth in paragraph (d)(2) of this subdivision, the applicant may notify the Department of its failure by means of certified mail, return receipt requested, to the local Department representative identified in 15 RCNY § 18-15 who is responsible for processing the application and a copy to the Engineering Section. If the Department fails to notify the applicant of its determination as to the completeness or incompleteness of the application within ten (10) business days of receiving the notice, the application shall be deemed complete as of the eleventh day.

   (4) The Department shall notify the applicant in writing of its determination within twenty (20) days of determining that an application for review and approval of a conventional individual sewage treatment system to be installed on an individual lot which is not within a subdivision is complete pursuant to the procedures set forth in paragraph (d)(2) of this subdivision unless the Department and the applicant mutually agree in writing upon an extension of the twenty (20) day review period. If, during the twenty (20) day review period, the Department requests revisions to the application, the review period shall be suspended from the date such request is made until the date on which the Department receives such revisions, provided that the Department shall have no fewer than ten (10) days from the date of receipt to issue a determination.

   (5) For all applications for review and approval, other than for a conventional individual sewage treatment system to be installed on an individual lot which is not within a subdivision, the Department shall notify an applicant in writing of its determination within forty-five (45) days of notifying the applicant that the application is complete pursuant to the procedures set forth in paragraph (d)(2) of this subdivision unless the Department and the applicant mutually agree in writing upon an extension of the forty-five (45) day review period. If, during the forty-five (45) day review period, the Department requests revisions to the application, the review period shall be suspended from the date such request is made until the date on which the Department receives such revisions, provided that the Department shall have no fewer than ten (10) days from the date of receipt to issue a determination.

   (6) If the Department fails to notify an applicant in writing of its determination within the twenty (20) day time period as set forth in paragraph (d)(4) of this subdivision or the forty-five (45) day time period as set forth in paragraph (d)(5) of this subdivision, the applicant may notify the Department of its failure by means of certified mail, return receipt requested to the local Department representative identified in 15 RCNY § 18-15 who is responsible for processing the application and a copy to Regulatory and Engineering Programs. The notice shall contain the applicant's name, location of the proposed project, the office in which the application was filed, and a statement that a decision is sought in accordance with this subdivision. Any notice failing to provide this information will not invoke this provision.

      (i) If the Department fails to notify the applicant of its decision within ten (10) business days of the receipt of such notice, the application shall be deemed approved subject to the standard terms and conditions applicable to such an approval.

   (7) Notwithstanding the time period for notifying an applicant of the Department's determination specified in paragraphs (d)(4), (d)(5) and (d)(6) of this section, if a lead agency has determined that a project may have a significant effect on the environment for purposes of the State Environmental Quality Review Act (SEQRA), such time periods shall be suspended pending receipt from the lead agency of either a Final Environmental Impact Statement (FEIS) or a determination of nonsignificance. Upon receipt of either document, the time periods shall resume, provided, however, that the Department shall have at least twenty (20) days to notify an applicant of its determination.

   (8) Notwithstanding the time periods for decisions specified in this subdivision, the Department may condition an approval on the applicant providing satisfactory proof of any bonds required by the Department within thirty days of the applicant receiving the conditional approval from the Department.

   (9) Any notice required or permitted to be given by the Department under this Subchapter shall be given in such manner designed to reach the applicant, as the Department deems appropriate, and may include, but is not limited to, regular mail, certified mail return receipt requested, or telecopier.






*§ 18-24 Emergency Procedures.* ::


(a)  Notwithstanding any other provision of this Subchapter, where an expedited review and approval of a regulated activity is necessary to respond to an imminent threat to the health and safety of humans or animals, or to respond to a substantial imminent threat to property, an applicant seeking such review and approval shall notify the Department by telephone at the office of the local representative listed in 15 RCNY § 18-15, and shall meet with the Department within 24 hours. At the meeting the applicant shall present to the representative of the Department such available information regarding the regulated activity as would otherwise be required in a written application for review and approval of the regulated activity.

The Department shall review and approve such an alteration or modification in accordance with the standards and procedures set forth in Subchapter F (variances). However, a noncomplying regulated activity may be reduced in size or extent without such review and approval provided that such reduction does not cause any increase in any existing discharge or any increase in the potential for contamination to or degradation of the water supply. An application for a regulated activity to be located on a site with a noncomplying regulated activity, which does not involve a substantial alteration or modification of a noncomplying regulated activity, shall be reviewed in accordance with the standards for that regulated activity.

   (4) In the event that any noncomplying regulated activity is discontinued for a period of one year or more, it shall permanently desist. However, a noncomplying regulated activity shall not be deemed discontinued in the following situations:

      (i) Seasonal use of a residence or business;

      (ii) Destruction of 75 percent or more of the market value of a noncomplying regulated activity and its related property, by flood, fire, or other natural disaster, provided that any replacement of a noncomplying regulated activity shall be identical in capacity, intensity, volume and type to the former noncomplying regulated activity and provided that such replacement shall take place within two years of such destruction, and provided further that such replacement shall comply with these rules and regulations, where possible;

      (iii) Transfer, sale, or lease of a residence or business provided further that the noncomplying regulated activity is not changed to a different noncomplying regulated activity, unless approved by the Department, and provided that such transfer, sale or lease occurs within three years of the offering for sale or lease of the residence or business.

   (5) Should any noncomplying regulated activity cause contamination to or degradation of the water supply, such that the activity is a threat to the life, health, or safety of water supply users, the Commissioner may order that such noncomplying regulated activity conform either in whole or in part to the requirements of these rules and regulations, immediately or within a limited period of time at the Commissioner's discretion, or be discontinued immediately. Any person who receives such an order may request a hearing on such order in the manner provided in 15 RCNY § 18-29.

   (6) Any owner or operator of a noncomplying regulated activity who was not required by these rules and regulations to notify the Department pursuant to paragraph (1) of subdivision (b) of this section, may request, in writing, a determination from the Department that such property or activity is a noncomplying regulated activity. The written request shall include all of the information required in such paragraph.

   (2) The Department shall publish a directory of all commercial, industrial, institutional or governmental noncomplying regulated activities located in the watershed based upon the information submitted pursuant to paragraph (1) of this subdivision, and any additional information available to the Department.

   (3) The directory shall be published in a newspaper of general circulation for two consecutive weekdays in each of two consecutive weeks.

   (4) Within sixty days of the last date of such publication, any commercial, industrial, institutional, or governmental owner or operator of a noncomplying regulated activity shall notify the Department in writing of any objection to the information set forth in the directory. Furthermore, any owner or operator of a noncomplying regulated activity shall notify the Department in writing of the omission from the directory of his or her noncomplying regulated activity.

   (5) Within 120 days of the last date of publication of the directory, the Department shall publish a revised directory, in accordance with the procedures provided for in paragraph (3) of this subdivision.

   (6) If, within five years of the effective date of these rules and regulations, a commercial, industrial, institutional or governmental owner or operator of a noncomplying regulated activity discovers that his or her property should have been included in the final directory and was not included, such owner or operator shall write to the Department and request that the property be added to the directory. The request shall include all of the facts surrounding the omission from the listing and the reason why the property should be designated a noncomplying regulated activity, as well as all supporting documentary evidence, such as title searches, deeds, etc. Based upon the submission, the Department shall determine whether to add the property to the directory and shall notify the petitioner in writing of its decision.

   (7) Upon written notification by the Department, a commercial, industrial, institutional, or governmental owner or operator of a noncomplying regulated activity may be required to submit any results of local, state or federally mandated or conducted tests or environmental audits. In addition, such owner or operator may be required to provide to the Department copies of any reports or applications submitted to local, state and federal agencies relating to the noncomplying regulated activity.

A stormwater pollution prevention plan shall ensure that any closed stormwater conveyance measures are sized appropriately to convey, at a minimum, the 10-year, 24-hour storm flow.

   (3) Stormwater Treatment Volume. All stormwater pollution prevention plans prepared pursuant to this section shall include measures to capture and treat the greater of the volume of runoff generated by the 1-year, 24-hour storm or the Water Quality Volume (WQv). Stormwater management practices which provide treatment shall be designed to accommodate the quantity of runoff flowing to the stormwater management practice, including runoff from off-site areas.

   (4) Where a stormwater pollution prevention plan prepared pursuant to this section includes a stormwater infiltration practice, to the maximum extent practicable, no portion of such stormwater infiltration practice shall be located within 100 feet of any portion of the absorption area of a subsurface sewage treatment system.

   (5) To the maximum extent practicable, an activity requiring a stormwater pollution prevention plan, and the stormwater pollution prevention plan prepared for such activity, shall be designed:

      (i) To minimize the alteration of the existing drainage areas and to maintain the volumes of flow at design points at pre-construction levels, except as necessary to alleviate downstream flooding problems or other adverse conditions in existence prior to construction, or to divert runoff from off-site and/or undisturbed areas away from areas proposed to be disturbed.

      (ii) To minimize loss of annual recharge to groundwater by maximizing the use of stormwater infiltration practices where suitable soil conditions exist.

   (6) If an activity requiring a stormwater pollution prevention plan will result in impervious surfaces covering twenty percent (20%) or more of the drainage area for which a stormwater management practice is designed, the stormwater pollution prevention plan shall provide for stormwater runoff from that drainage area to be treated by two different types of stormwater management practices in series, except that only one stormwater management practice is required if either:

      (i) the stormwater management practice provided is a stormwater infiltration practice; or

      (ii) the activity requiring a stormwater pollution prevention plan is in the West of Hudson watershed within a village, hamlet, village extension, or area zoned for commercial or industrial uses or in the East of Hudson watershed within a Designated Main Street Area.

   (7) For purposes of the design criteria incorporated by reference in New York State Department of Environmental Conservation General Permit GP-0-10-001, "detention time" shall mean the time runoff is detained in a stormwater management practice. It can be computed using either the center of mass method or the plug flow method.

(d) Application requirements and procedures.

   (1) An application for approval of a stormwater pollution prevention plan shall include:

      (i) The pollution prevention plan; and

      (ii) The information required in a Notice of Intent under New York State Department of Environmental Conservation SPDES General Permit No. GP-0-10-001.

      (ii) The Department shall not be required to meet with or otherwise further consult with a member of the Committee concerning an application where the Committee member declines to review the application or fails to attend a meeting of the Committee convened to consider the application.

   (3) Upon completion of their review of the application, and upon a majority vote of the Committee members, including the Department's Committee member, who reviewed the application, the Committee may recommend to the Department that an application for approval of a stormwater pollution prevention plan be approved, approved with conditions or disapproved.

      (i) If the Department's Committee member agrees with the majority recommendation of the Committee, the Department may proceed to issue its determination to the applicant.

      (ii) If the Department's Committee member disagrees with the majority recommendation of the Committee, the application, together with the written recommendation of the Committee, shall be submitted to the Commissioner of the Department for review and a determination. The Commissioner shall issue a written record of decision setting forth the basis for the determination and responding to any contrary written recommendations submitted by any member of the Committee.

      (iii) If the Committee fails to make a recommendation to the Department at least fifteen (15) days prior to the date the Department is required to notify an applicant in writing of its determination pursuant to 15 RCNY § 18-23(d)(5), the Department may proceed to issue its determination and the Department shall not be required by these rules and regulations to further consult with or consider the comments of the Committee or any member of the Committee.

   (4) Failure of any Committee member, other than the Department Committee member, to act in accordance with the procedures or within the time frames set forth in these rules and regulations, shall relieve the Department of any obligation to consult with or consider the comments of the Committee member. Failure of any Committee member, other than the Department Committee member, to act in accordance with the procedures or within the time frames set forth in these rules and regulations, shall not invalidate any determination issued by the Department.

   (5) A Committee may only make recommendations to the Department and shall have no authority to make decisions on behalf of the Department.

*§ 18-82 Watershed Planning in the Croton System.* ::


(a)  Notwithstanding the prohibitions set forth in 15 RCNY § 18-36 on new or expanded wastewater treatment plants with surface discharges within the sixty day travel time to intake or within phosphorus restricted basins, the Department shall allow for the preparation and implementation of a Comprehensive Croton System Water Quality Protection Plan ("Croton Plan") and an accompanying phosphorus offset program and diversion credit program in accordance with this 15 RCNY § 18-82. 15 RCNY § 18-82 is independent of, does not govern, and is not governed by, 15 RCNY § 18-81.

(b) (1) At the request of Dutchess, Putnam or Westchester County, and in partnership with Dutchess, Putnam or Westchester County, and the municipalities located in the Croton system watershed, the Department shall prepare or assist in the preparation of a Croton Plan only in a participating County or Counties which:

      (i) Identifies significant sources of pollution to the Croton system;

      (ii) Recommends measures to be taken by the Department, the Counties, and the municipalities which, in conjunction with other federal, State, local and Department water quality protection programs, will prevent degradation to, and improve, water quality, with the long term goal of attaining water quality standards in the Croton system; and

      (iii) Recommends measures to be taken to protect the character and special needs of communities located within the watershed.

   (2) A County wishing to do so may, when joined by a majority of municipalities located within the County's watershed, choose to prepare the Croton Plan for the portion of the watershed located within the County. Such Croton Plan shall be prepared in partnership with the Department.

   (3) The Croton Plan shall be developed in the manner set forth in subdivisions (c), (d) and (e) below and may allow for new wastewater treatment plants with a surface discharge or for the expansion of existing wastewater treatment plants with a surface discharge, provided the additional flow is either offset by a diversion of wastewater off of the watershed pursuant to subparagraph (e)(4)(i), or the additional phosphorus load is offset pursuant to subparagraph (e)(4)(ii).

   (4) Any data that would benefit the Croton Planning process that is in the possession of the Department or one of the Counties or municipalities participating in the development of a Croton Plan shall be shared among the participants and appropriately considered in developing a Croton Plan.

(c) The Croton Plan shall consist of the following three elements:

   (1) Identification of water quality problems and community character needs. Such identification shall include the following elements:

      (i) An identification of growth or development projected to occur under existing municipal zoning and master plans and allowed under existing land use controls, other than these rules and regulations, and including development necessary to maintain community character, public facilities and institutions and to serve local, regional or special needs;

      (ii) An identification of specific existing water quality problem areas and specific sources of pollution to the Croton system, including areas of existing or imminent subsurface sewage treatment system failures, areas of concentrated point source discharges and substantial non-point source pollution, and areas in need of streambank stabilization.

      (iii) An assessment of future water quality impacts related to growth or development identified in paragraph (i) above.

      (iv) An identification of areas identified in paragraph (i) above where site constraints may prevent the siting of new subsurface sewage treatment systems in accordance with the requirements set forth in these rules and regulations.

      (v) An identification of areas identified in paragraph (i) above where these rules and regulations prohibit new surface discharges from wastewater treatment plants and site constraints prevent the siting of a new wastewater treatment plant with a subsurface discharge.

   (2) Identification of investments to correct existing water quality problems in accordance with developed priorities. Such identification shall include the following elements:

      (i) The identified investments may include investments (i.e., capital projects and best management practices) implemented during the development of the Croton Plan, investments that the participating Counties and municipalities commit to implement, and an identification of priorities for future investments, without any commitment on the part of the Counties and municipalities to implement such investments.

      (ii) Proposed measures to address water quality problems identified in paragraph (c)(1)(ii) above. Such measures may include subsurface sewage treatment system maintenance, rehabilitation and replacement programs, installation of community septic systems, the construction of sewer extensions or new sewer systems, stormwater controls, and the permanent diversion of wastewater to a discharge point outside of the watershed.

   (3) Strategies for prevention of future water quality problems and the consideration of future community character needs in conjunction with the water quality goals of the Croton Plan. Such strategies shall include the following:

      (i) An assessment of the economic, water quality, community character, and special needs impacts of directing growth away from areas identified in paragraphs (c)(1)(iv) and (v) above;

      (ii) An identification of the economic, water quality and community character impacts of allowing growth within those areas identified in paragraphs (c)(1)(i), (iv) and (v) above, if directing growth in accordance with paragraph (c)(3)(i) above is not feasible or practical;

      (iii) An identification of potential areas for the construction of new or expanded wastewater treatment plants, as provided for in (e) below, either under a future permanent phosphorus offset program or utilizing the 10 percent credit provision for an implemented diversion project and a statement of the reasoning for the selection of such potential areas;

      (iv) An identification of land use and local laws and regulations that the participating Counties and municipalities have already implemented and/or agree to implement in the future which are intended, in combination with other measures in the Croton Plan, to mitigate the water quality impacts identified in subsection (c)(1)(iii) above;

      (v) With respect to future land use issues, identification of mechanisms to ensure the improvement and protection of water quality is taken into consideration by the local government and that the local government agrees to use best efforts to implement such mechanisms; and

      (vi) At the option of the local government, designation of "village centers" as provided for in 15 RCNY § 18-39(a)(7)(i).

(d) (1) If a County requests, pursuant to 15 RCNY § 18-82(b), that a Croton Plan be developed within five (5) years of the effective date of these rules and regulations, the Department, in partnership with the participating Counties and municipalities, and in consultation with the New York State Department of Health, shall complete a draft Croton Plan and release such draft Croton Plan for public review and comment. If a Croton Plan has been prepared by a County and its municipalities, the County and municipalities, in partnership with the Department and in consultation with the New York State Department of Health, shall complete a draft Croton Plan within five (5) years of the effective date of these rules and regulations and release such draft Croton Plan for public review and comment. The Department, the participating Counties and municipalities shall consider and respond to comments received from the public in preparing the final Croton Plan.

   (2) Within six (6) months after the release of the draft Croton Plan, the final Croton Plan shall be agreed to by the Department and the Counties and municipalities which participated in the preparation of the Croton Plan, and in consultation with the New York State Department of Health. In determining whether to agree to the Croton Plan, the Department will consider the Croton Plan, including the level of commitments therein, taken as a whole and consistent with subsection (d) of this section, meets the overall goals of the Croton Plan, set forth in subsection (b) of this section. The Department will not approve or disapprove individual components of the Croton Plan. The Department and the participating Counties and municipalities shall make a reasonable effort to resolve any and all issues which preclude their agreement to the Croton Plan. The five (5) year period referred to in paragraph (1) above, and/or the six (6) month period referred to in this paragraph (2) may be extended by agreement of the Department and the participating Counties and municipalities. In addition, the participating Counties and municipalities may, at any time, agree to discontinue the development of the Croton Plan.

   (3) A failure of any participating County or municipality to agree to the Croton Plan shall not affect the ability of another participating County or municipality to agree to the Croton Plan and to site new wastewater treatment plants or to expand existing wastewater treatment plants with a surface discharge in accordance with subdivision (e).

   (4) Once the Croton Plan is agreed to by the Department and the participating Counties and municipalities, the Croton Plan shall be considered valid and effective. The participating Counties and municipalities agreeing to the Croton Plan may, upon 60 days written notice to the City, modify the Plan at any time after it has been agreed upon. If the Croton Plan is proposed to be modified, the Department shall make a determination within sixty (60) days of notice of the proposed modification, whether the Croton Plan, as modified, shall continue to be valid and effective. In making such a determination, the Department shall consider whether the Croton Plan, as modified and taken as a whole, is consistent with subsection (d) of this section and meets the overall goals of the Croton Plan set forth in subsection (b) of this section. Any approved Croton Plan remains in effect pending any determination on a proposed modification and shall remain in effect until and unless either the Department agrees to a modification or a local government modifies it without the Department's approval or ceases to implement it.

   (5) Any Croton Plan agreed to shall be reviewed by the participants to the plan fifteen (15) years after the Croton Plan becomes effective in order to determine whether the Croton Plan has met and will continue to meet its goals, and to determine whether new goals are appropriate.

   (6) The Counties and the municipalities agreeing to the Croton Plan shall submit to the Department an annual report each year the Croton Plan is in effect. The annual report shall be submitted on the anniversary of the date the Croton Plan became effective and shall include:

      (i) A statement of the status of the developmnt or implementation of measures proposed in the Croton Plan;

      (ii) A statement of expenditures incurred by the Counties and municipalities in implementing, and administering measures proposed in the Croton Plan; and

      (iii) An identification of the financial, personnel and other resources needed to continue implementation and administration of the measures proposed in the Croton Plan.

(e) The Croton Plan may allow for the siting of a new wastewater treatment plant with a surface discharge or the expansion of an existing wastewater treatment plant with a surface discharge in the Croton system within a phosphorus restricted basin or a basin located within the 60 day travel time, but not within a coliform restricted basin, pursuant to the following conditions:

   (1) Site constraints prevent the proposed new wastewater treatment plant or the expanded existing wastewater treatment plant from discharging subsurface;

   (2) The municipal government and the County in which the wastewater treatment plant would be sited, confirms in writing that the proposed new wastewater treatment plant or the expansion of an existing wastewater treatment plant is consistent with the Croton Plan;

   (3) The Department, in consultation with the New York State Department of Health, determines that the proposed new wastewater treatment plant or expansion of an existing wastewater treatment plant is consistent with the water quality objectives of the Croton Plan; and

   (4) The discharge from the new wastewater treatment plant or the expansion of an existing wastewater treatment plant complies with one of the following conditions:

      (i) The total volume (or flow) of surface discharge from such new wastewater treatment plant or expansion of an existing wastewater treatment plant, together with the total volume of surface discharges from all other new wastewater treatment plants and expansions of wastewater treatment plants which have been permitted in the subject County pursuant to this subparagraph (i), shall not, in the aggregate, exceed 10 percent of the total volume (or flow) of surface discharge from wastewater treatment plants located in the Croton system, within the subject County, which previously discharged into the Croton system but have been permanently diverted, since the effective date of these rules and regulations, to a discharge point outside of the Watershed. The Department may approve applications to construct new wastewater treatment plants with surface discharges pursuant to this subdivision prior to the permanent diversion of wastewater, and allow construction to begin on such new wastewater treatment plants, provided that the wastewater treatment plant may not commence operation until the diversion for which the credit is received has actually occurred; or

      (ii) In phosphorus restricted basins located outside of the sixty day travel time, provided that the Department has determined pursuant to 15 RCNY § 18-84, based upon the results of the pilot programs set forth in 15 RCNY §§ 18-82(g) and 18-83(a), or of other studies conducted within the watershed, that the phosphorus offsets sought by the pilot programs have been achieved, the Department may require that for each one (1) kilogram of projected increase in the phosphorus load resulting from the proposed new wastewater treatment plant, together with any accompanying non-point source runoff, is actually offset by at least three (3) kilograms of reductions in phosphorus loading within the basin within which the proposed project is located, including reductions from measures identified in and implemented in accordance with the Croton Plan pursuant to paragraph (c)(8) above, and otherwise eligible for an offset hereunder, whether the source of the offsets is in the same basin or within an upstream, hydrologically connected phosphorus restricted basin.

   (5) With respect to any new or expanded wastewater treatment plant allowed pursuant to this subdivision (e), the Department will not impose additional requirements on the siting of such new or expanded wastewater treatment plant other than the requirements specifically set forth in these rules and regulations applicable to all wastewater treatment plants, the requirements of this subdivision (e), and, with respect to new or expanded wastewater treatment plants in phosphorus restricted basins relying on phosphorus offsets, the requirements of any phosphorus offset program pursuant to 15 RCNY §§ 18-82(g), 18-83(a) and 18-84.

(f) (1) A County or municipality wishing to participate in the preparation of the Croton Plan shall indicate its intention to participate by written notice to the Department given within one year of the effective date of these rules and regulations. Such notice shall include a commitment by the subject County or municipality to cooperate with the Department in generating and analyzing the data and information reasonably necessary to address the Croton Plan elements identified in subdivision (c) above, and an agreement to minimize the use of offsets as a basis for new wastewater treatment plants or expansions of existing wastewater treatment plants pursuant to subdivision (e), to the extent that the economic and social needs of such County or municipality can be reasonably addressed without the use of such offsets.

   (2) Within thirty (30) days after receipt of a notice as described in subdivision (f)(1) above, the Department shall notify a County or municipality of its inclusion in the preparation of a Croton Plan.

   (3) If a County and its municipalities wish to prepare a Croton Plan, in accordance with subdivision (b)(2) above, the Department shall, within thirty (30) days of receipt of a notice as described in subdivision (f)(1) above, authorize the County and municipalities to begin preparation of such a Croton Plan. Such authorization shall include a commitment by the Department to cooperate with the County and municipalities in generating the data and information reasonably necessary to address the Croton Plan elements identified in subdivision (c) above.

   (4) The provisions of subdivision (e) above shall not apply in any County or municipality which fails to participate in the preparation of the Croton Plan, fails to cooperate with the Department in the manner described in paragraph (f)(1) above in preparing the Croton Plan; fails or ceases to implement any water quality protection measures which such County or municipality has committed to implement as part of the final Croton Plan agreed upon by the County, municipality and the Department; or where a previously agreed upon Croton Plan is no longer valid and effective.

(g) In Putnam County, provided that Putnam County has committed in writing to participate in the development of the Croton Plan pursuant to subdivision (d) above, the Department shall allow for a pilot program to evaluate the effectiveness of phosphorus offsets as a potential basis for allowing construction of new wastewater treatment plants within phosphorus restricted basins in the Croton system. Such pilot program shall be limited to a term of five (5) years, commencing on the effective date of these rules and regulations and expiring on the fifth anniversary thereof. During the term of the pilot program, the Department may approve within a Putnam County municipality which has committed in writing to participate in development of the Croton Plan, the construction of a new wastewater treatment plant with a surface discharge within a phosphorus restricted basin in the Croton system provided that the following conditions are met:

   (1) The applicant proposing a new wastewater treatment plant demonstrates that the County or municipality agrees to the plant's inclusion in the pilot program;

   (2) The applicant demonstrates, and commits to take action to insure, that for every one (1) kilogram of projected increase in the phosphorus load resulting from the new wastewater treatment plant and accompanying non-point source runoff, there will be an offset which achieves at least three (3) kilograms of reduction in phosphorus within the basin in which the new wastewater treatment plant is located, whether the source of the offset is in the same basin or within an upstream hydrologically connected phosphorus restricted basin;

   (3) All new wastewater treatment plants proposed to be constructed pursuant to this pilot program shall be reviewed and approved by the Department in accordance with 15 RCNY § 18-36;

   (4) No more than three (3) wastewater treatment plants with surface discharges may be located in the Croton system in Putnam County pursuant to this pilot program.

   (5) Any wastewater treatment plant constructed pursuant to this pilot program shall be designed and operated to meet a total phosphorus effluent limit of .2 mg/l.

(h) Nothing in this Subpart is intended to constrain, limit or preclude an applicant from seeking, or the Department from issuing, approval of or a variance for a proposed regulated activity under any other applicable provision of these rules and regulations.

(i) Nothing in this section or in the Croton Plan is intended to constrain or limit the authority of local governments under State law to make local land use and zoning decisions, and nothing in this section or the Croton Plan should be construed to have the effect of transferring such local land use and zoning authority from the participating local governments to the Department or any other entity.






*§ 18-83 Watershed Planning in the West of Hudson Watershed.* ::


(a)  The Department shall establish a pilot program to evaluate the effectiveness of phosphorus offsets as a potential basis for allowing the construction of new wastewater treatment plants, or the expansion of existing plants, with a surface discharge in a phosphorus restricted basin located in the West of Hudson watershed. Such pilot program shall be limited to a term of five (5) years, commencing on the effective date of these rules and regulations and expiring on the fifth anniversary thereof. During the term of the pilot program, the Department may approve the siting of a new wastewater treatment plant, or the expansion of an existing plant, with a surface discharge in a phosphorus restricted basin located in the West of Hudson watershed, provided that the following conditions are met:

   (1) The County in which the new wastewater treatment plant, or the expansion of an existing plant, is proposed to be sited has prepared, or is in the process of preparing, a Comprehensive Strategy, in partnership with the Department and with the local governments located within the County and affected by the Comprehensive Strategy. The Comprehensive Strategy should identify existing economic resources, water quality problems, potential remedies for such problems and potential strategies and recommendations of economic development initiatives that could be undertaken to sustain local economies while remaining protective of the water supply.

   (2) The applicant demonstrates that the new wastewater treatment plant, or the expansion of an existing plant, together with the offsets the applicant is proposing to make under paragraph (3) below, is consistent with the Comprehensive Strategy.

   (3) The applicant demonstrates, and commits to take action to insure, that every one (1) kilogram of projected increase in the phosphorus load resulting from the new wastewater treatment plant or the expansion of an existing plant, and the accompanying non-point source runoff will be actually offset by at least three (3) kilograms of reductions in phosphorus loading within the basin in which such new wastewater treatment plant, or the expansion of an existing plant, is located. For purposes of this subdivision, the applicant may use as an offset any phosphorus reduction funded by the Catskill Fund for the Future or achieved from stormwater pollution prevention measures installed on existing structures or impervious surfaces in a village center or hamlet and funded by the Department.

   (4) All new wastewater treatment plants, or expansions of existing plants, proposed to be constructed pursuant to this pilot program shall be reviewed and approved by the Department;

   (5) No more than three (3) new wastewater treatment plants, or expansions of existing plants, with surface discharge shall be allowed into any phosphorus restricted basin pursuant to this pilot program. The total capacity, as constructed, of the three (3) plants shall not exceed a maximum of 100,000 gpd aggregate surface discharge.

   (6) Any wastewater treatment plant, or expansion of an existing plant, constructed pursuant to this pilot program shall be designed and operated to meet the total phosphorus effluent limit of .2 mg/l.

(b) Nothing in this Subpart is intended to constrain, limit or preclude an applicant from seeking, or the Department from issuing, approval of or a variance for a proposed regulated activity under any other applicable provision of these rules and regulations.






*§ 18-84 Permanent Phosphorus Offset Program.* ::


(a)  Upon completion of the pilot programs set forth in 15 RCNY §§ 18-82(g) and 18-83(a), the Department may determine, based on the results of the pilot program or of other studies conducted in the Watershed that:

   (1) Phosphorus offsets sought pursuant to 15 RCNY §§ 18-82(g) and 18-83(a) have been achieved and that a permanent phosphorus offset program should be established, with such conditions as may be appropriate based on the results of the pilot program or other studies conducted in the Watershed.

      (i) Pending completion of any necessary rulemaking for the continuation of a permanent phosphorus offset program, including any appropriate modifications thereto, the Department may allow the construction of new wastewater treatment plants with surface discharges into phosphorus restricted basins located outside of the sixty day travel time on a case-by-case basis pursuant to the standards set forth in 15 RCNY § 18-61 and subject to such conditions as may be appropriate based upon the results of the pilot program and other studies conducted in the watershed; or

   (2) There is insufficient data on which to make a determination that phosphorus offsets have been achieved; therefore, the time frame for the pilot programs shall be extended for a period not to exceed five years to allow for the acquisition of further data. Nothing contained in this subdivision shall allow for an increase in the number or size of the wastewater treatment plants allowed pursuant to the pilot programs as set forth in 15 RCNY §§ 18-82(g) and 18-83(a).

   (3) In the West of Hudson watershed, in any permanent phosphorus offset program, provided the applicant demonstrates, and commits to take action to insure, that every one (1) kilogram of projected increase in the phosphorus load resulting from the new wastewater treatment plant or the expansion of an existing plant, and the accompanying non-point source runoff will be actually offset by at least three (3) kilograms of reductions in phosphorus loading within the basin in which such new wastewater treatment plant, or the expansion of an existing plant, is located, the applicant may use as an offset any phosphorus reduction funded by the Catskill Fund for the Future or achieved from stormwater pollution prevention measures installed on existing structures or impervious surfaces in a village center or hamlet and funded by the Department.

(b) (1) Notwithstanding anything contained in 15 RCNY § 19-04(a) above, when the volume of a single toxic discharge or the combined toxic discharges of a group of establishments within a single drainage area is large enough, in the opinion of the Commissioner, to create unacceptable total concentrations of a toxic substance either in the influent entering a sewage treatment plant or in the receiving waters, the Commissioner may by order impose more stringent concentration limits than those listed in 15 RCNY § 19-04(a), or impose mass limits upon the person or persons so discharging. Conversely, when a toxic discharge is sufficiently diluted or rendered innocuous before reaching a sewage treatment plant or the receiving waters, the Commissioner may, in his absolute discretion, grant written permission for discharge concentrations greater than those listed in 15 RCNY § 19-04(a).

   (2) The Commissioner may by order impose maximum amounts or concentrations of a toxic substance which may be discharged directly or indirectly to a public sewer from an industrial source notwithstanding that such amounts or concentrations are less than those demanded by other subdivisions of this section or that the substance is not regulated by such subdivisions for that source, provided that such amounts or concentrations are economically achievable by that source as determined by the Commissioner. Within 20 days after service of the Commissioner's determination and order, the person discharging the toxic substance may request a hearing at which evidence may be presented only upon the issue of the economic achievability of the maximum amounts or concentrations of the toxic substance, as imposed by the Commissioner, to be discharged to the public sewer. Following such hearing, the hearing officer designated by the Commissioner shall report his findings and recommendations to the Commissioner who, in his discretion, may sustain, revoke, or modify his original determination and order. The Commissioner shall, upon his decision to sustain or modify his original determination and order, issue a final order to the person discharging the toxic substance to comply with such decision.

(c) Pursuant to § 24-523(e)(2) of the Administrative Code, all pretreatment standards and requirements promulgated pursuant to the Federal Water Pollution Control Act, commonly referred to as the Clean Water Act, as amended, including time limitations for compliance with such standards, monitoring of wastewater and the reporting of the results of such monitoring are hereby incorporated into these regulations and all such reports shall also be made to the Commissioner. All sources of pollutants or toxic substances to the public sewers, subject to such pretreatment standards, shall discharge wastewaters to the public sewers in conformance with such standards, provided however, that if a more stringent standard is applicable under 15 RCNY §§ 19-04(a) or 19-04(b) or any other section of these Regulations then the said more stringent standard shall be controlling.

(d) Pretreatment systems shall be maintained in good working order and operated properly so as to insure continued compliance with 15 RCNY §§ 19-03 and 19-04.

(e) No person shall increase the use of process water or in any way attempt to dilute a discharge as a partial or complete substitute means of pretreatment in order to comply with any provision of any section of these Regulations.

      (i) The Developer/Builder does not have a Prospectus at the time house connection permits have to be issued as consequence of a hardship.

      (ii) The Developer/Builder does not have a Prospectus which is most likely early on in the construction sequence of his Building Construction, however needs one or several connections to drain his construction site.

   (2) The manner in which conditional House Connection Permits are issued is as follows: The Local Office will approve a Permit Application conditionally by indicating on it that the Certificate of Inspections are not to be released until a Prospectus has been secured.

(b) Trailer connections. Basically there are two types of trailer connections:

   (1) A construction trailer that is necessitated by the construction of a Building. The trailer connection(s) in such a case should be tied in with the certification of the Site Connection Proposal and the issuance of the House Connections Permits for this building as follows:

      (i) The Plumber requesting the trailer connection should present a copy of the certified Site Connection Proposal with his Permit Application.

      (ii) The Local Office will issue a house connection permit subject to the following condition: We will withhold the Certificate of Inspection for at least one of the Buildings House Connections until the plug for the trailer connection is performed.

   (2) If the construction trailer is necessitated by D.O.T. (or any other Agency's) Capital Project the plumber should present an original letter from D.O.T. (or any other Agency) to D.E.P. indicating the following:

      (i) The number and size of connections needed.

      (ii) The duration of the construction operations at the end of which the plumber will plug the trailer connection(s).

      (iii) Guarantee from D.O.T. (or any other Agency) that the Plumber will obtain a plug permit(s) at the end of their construction operations to plug the trailer connection(s). The Local Office will not issue any other trailer connections to the agency in question if it is common knowledge that a job has been completed and there are outstanding open connections.

(c) BSA letter. Letters to the Board of Standards and Appeals for situations where there are no allowable storm/combined sewer outlets for storm discharge within 500 feet will be sent out upon verification by D.E.P. provided: The filing Engineer/Architect requests such a letter and encloses the following:

   (1) NB/BN/ALT numbers

   (2) Street address

   (3) Block &amp; Lot

   (4) Site Plans

   (5) Tentative Lot Sheets

   (6) Survey

(d) House connection charges (private sewers).

   (1) For private sewers that are still recoupable. (meaning either/or:

      (i) All property owners abutting the sewer have not paid their proportionate part of the sewer cost for sewers built prior to 1963)

      (ii) For sewers where the Construction Permits were obtained after January 1, 1963 the seven year period is not up and all the abutting property have not paid their share of the private sewer cost.)

   (2) The following procedure is to be followed:

      (i) Case I (Plumber has "Consent Letter"). At the time of applying for the House Connection Permit the Plumber will present the "Proof of Payment Letter" (Sewer Owner's Consent Letter) to the Local Office of the Permit Control Section in order to be able to connect to the Private Sewer.

      (ii) Case II (Missing Sewer Owner). At the time of applying for the House Connection Permit the plumber will present the following additional documents:

(A) Registered Letter Envelope with Post Office Stamp: Return to sender not at this address or something similar. (The addressee on the envelope should be the latest address we have on record which would prove that an attempt was made to contact the sewer owner.)

(B) A properly executed Missing Owner Affidavit.

(C) A House Connection Bond for a six year period which should be the House Connection Charge to the Private Sewer plus 25 percent (the computation of the House Connection Charge is determined/provided by the Local Office).

      (iii) Case III (House Connection Charge Dispute with Sewer Owner). At the time of applying for the House Connection Permit the plumber will present the following additional documents:

(A) A properly executed "Fee in Dispute Affidavit".

(B) A House Connection Bond for a six year period which should be the House Connection Charge to the Private Sewer plus 25 percent (the computation of the House Connection Charge is determined/provided by the Local Office).

(b) Submission of Business Confidentiality Claims ("Claims") in Response to Requests for Information by the Department.

   (1) Method and time to assert a claim. A business may assert a claim concerning information requested by the Department, by placing a cover sheet, stamped legend or any other suitable form of notice on the information, employing language such as "trade secret", "proprietary" or "company confidential" at the time such information is submitted. Allegedly confidential parts of otherwise non-confidential documents should be clearly marked as such. Effluent data, as defined in Part 2.302 of Title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations, cannot be treated as confidential.

   (2) Failure to submit a timely claim. If a business submits information in response to a Department request, without a claim accompanying such information at the time it is received by the Department, the Department need not make further inquiries to the business concerning confidentiality of the submitted information; the information may be made available for public inspection. If a claim is submitted after the Department has received the information, the Department may make efforts that are administratively practicable to process the late claim with the previously submitted information.

(c) Department requests for comments and their submission by claimants.

   (1) The Department shall give written notice to each business asserting a claim, in accordance with 15 RCNY § 19-09(b)(1), stating that written comments, as described in 15 RCNY § 19-09(c)(5), must be submitted no later than 15 business days after receipt by the business of the request for comments. The request for comments will indicate the address of the appropriate Department official to whom comments should be sent, and will also state that failure to submit timely comments will be construed as a waiver of the claim. This notice by the Department shall be made in such a manner that the fact and date of receipt may be verified.

   (2) The comment period may be extended, if, before comments are due, a written request for an extension has been made and approved by the Department.

   (3) If disclosure of information under a claim would be helpful in alleviating a situation posing an imminent and substantial danger to public health or safety, the Department may prescribe and make known to an affected business a shorter comment period that it finds necessary under the circumstances.

   (4) Information submitted by a business as part of its comments, pertaining to its claim, will be treated as part of the claim.

   (5) Written notice will invite comments on:

      (i) the period of time for which confidential treatment is desired;

      (ii) the extent to which the information has been disclosed to others and any measures or precautions taken to guard against undesired disclosure;

      (iii) whether any other governmental agency determination or any judicial decision has held the claimed information to be confidential. If so, a copy of such determination or decision, if available, must be included; and

      (iv) whether the business asserts that disclosure would be likely to result in substantial harmful effects on their competitive position, what those harmful effects would be, and why they should be viewed as substantial. The reasons why the information is considered to be confidential (i.e. why the information should be regarded as a trade secret or proprietary information) must be stated in detail.

(d) Non-final recommendation by the Department. When a business submits information to the Department that is claimed to be confidential, the Department shall consider the claim and comments, previously issued determinations, material submitted to the Department in response to requests, applicable substantive criteria and any other material that it finds appropriate.

Note: Aggregate volume is the maximum volume (e.g. length times width times height to the overflow if rectangular) in cubic inches of all fixtures, vessels and receptables that may flow simultaneously through the interceptor. * Subject to the sizing requirements specified in 15 RCNY § 19-11(i) through (p). If a premises contains fixtures listed in Table I and fixtures, vessels and/or receptacles listed in Table II, all of which are tributary to the same grease interceptor, then the method for determining the minimum grease interceptor retaining capacity, in pounds, shall be to separately calculate the retaining capacities for the fixtures in Table I, and the fixtures, vessels and/or receptacles in Table II. These retaining capacities shall then be added together to obtain the total minimum grease interceptor retaining capacity required for such premises. If the aggregate volumes listed in Tables I and II are exceeded then a New York State Licensed Professional Engineer or a New York State Registered Architect shall extrapolate the appropriate grease interceptor sizing requirements.

(d) Vented flow control fittings shall be installed to insure that the flow capacity of the grease interceptor, as specified by the manufacturer, is not exceeded. Flow-control valves and/or fittings that are manually adjustable may not be used to limit flow to an interceptor.

(e) Grease interceptors must have a retention capacity, in pounds, of at least twice the numerical flow through rating in gallons per minute.

(f) Grease interceptors shall remove an average of 90 percent or more of the grease or other extractable matter in the wastewater.

(g) The temperature of water entering a grease interceptor shall not exceed 180°F.

(h) All grease interceptors must be readily accessible for inspection by duly authorized employees of the Department.

(i) Grease interceptors for scraper sinks shall be sized in accordance with Table II, except that the minimum retaining capacity shall be at least 30 pounds. When determining the aggregate volume of all fixtures, vessels and receptacles specified in Table II that may flow simultaneously through an interceptor, a minimum of 3,465 cubic inches, per scraper sink, shall be used.

(j) Discharges from automatic dishwashers must be tributary to a grease interceptor. Whether connected separately or in conjunction with other fixtures, the total volume, in gallons, of each automatic dishwasher shall be converted to cubic inches and added to the aggregate volume of Table II.

(k) Discharges from high-temperature sanitizer cycles of automatic dishwashers or from dedicated sanitization compartments of sinks need not be tributary to a grease interceptor.

(l) Floor drains which may receive grease must be tributary to a grease interceptor. The size of such grease interceptor shall be determined as follows:

   (1) For floor drains where grease may be discharged during washdowns, Table I shall be used and an additional 1,540 cubic inches, per floor drain, shall be added to the aggregate volume.

   (2) Grease interceptors for floor drains, which receive discharges directly from fixtures, receptacles and/or vessels, shall be sized in accordance with the grease interceptor sizing requirements for the fixtures, vessels and/or receptacles tributary to it.

   (3) For floor drains having a diameter larger than 3 inches or for trench and/or trough drains, a New York State Licensed Professional Engineer or a New York State Registered Architect shall extrapolate the appropriate sizing requirements of the tributary grease interceptor based on (1) and/or (2) above.

(m) For soup and/or stock kettles, the calculation of aggregate volume to be used in Table II shall be made based upon the total volume of all soup and stock kettles tributary to the grease interceptor, even if discharges from these vessels are made to a floor drain or similar fixture.

(n) Where woks, either alone or in conjunction with other types of fixtures are tributary to a grease interceptor, each wok shall be deemed to contribute 1,617 cubic inches to the aggregate volume of Table II.

(o) Discharges from the cleaning of kitchen hoods, which may extract grease from cooking operations, must be made to receptacles or floor drains that are tributary to a grease interceptor. The sizing of the tributary grease interceptor must account for such discharges using standard engineering practice. For kitchen hoods with automatic rinse cycles, the tributary grease interceptor must be sized to account for the peak flow from the automatic rinse cycle as specified by the manufacturer.

(p) Interceptors smaller than those described in Tables I and II may be used, but only if connected in parallel to another interceptor(s), and the aggregate capacity of such interceptors must either equal or exceed the interceptor capacity required by Tables I and/or II. For parallel connections, vented flow control fixtures must be installed on each interceptor.

(q) Grease interceptors shall be properly installed, maintained and operated, to insure that the requirements of this section and other applicable sections of the regulations are met. This shall include routine cleaning and grease removal from the interceptor, as needed to insure the proper operation of the interceptors.

(r) New York State Licensed Professional Engineers and New York State Registered Architects may petition the Commissioner, in writing, for acceptance of an alternate pretreatment device, technology, equipment, or procedures varying from, but equivalent to, those listed in this section. Such a petition must contain detailed documentation and calculations substantiating their equivalency. In no event shall any alternative pretreatment device, technology, equipment or procedures be less stringent than the requirements of this section.

(s) Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, (1) existing grease interceptors shall conform to the specific requirements of this section no later than one year after the effective date of this section and (2) grease interceptors installed after the effective date of this section pursuant to an application filed before such effective date shall conform to the specific requirements of this section no later than 90 days after such effective date.

(t) Notwithstanding anything contained in 15 RCNY § 19-11 the Commissioner, in his discretion, may require any grease interceptor to be installed, at any time, and to have a retention capacity equal to those listed in Tables I and/or II.

*§ 20-02 Taps to City Water Mains.* ::


(a)  Separate supply. A separate corporation stop (tap) and service pipe shall be installed for each building supplied with City water, except for buildings that have service pipes supplied by internal water mains as described in 15 RCNY § 20-03(b). One tax lot cannot be supplied with water from another tax lot. Siamese corporation stops (taps) or service pipes on the inlet side of the main house control valve are prohibited. A service pipe connected to the City main by a T-connection, or by any means other than a corporation stop (tap) or a wet connection, shall be controlled by a gate valve placed in the service pipe, and located within two (2) feet of the point of connection to the main.

(b) Connections to city mains.

   (1) Corporation stops (taps) and wet connections to a City Main shall be inserted or installed only by Department employees. Waivers may be granted for T-connections in extenuating circumstances (i.e. connections to two (2) inch mains and two (2) or three (3) inch connections to a four (4) inch main).

   (2) A two (2) or three (3) inch connection to any main four (4) inches in diameter or less shall be made by a T-Connection with an adjacent valve.

   (3) Direct corporation stop connections (taps) shall not exceed one (1) inch in diameter for mains four (4) inches or less in diameter. Each one and one-half (11/2) inch corporation stop connection (tap) to such a main shall be made through a tapping saddle, as directed by the Department. The tapping saddle is to be provided and set by the Licensed Master Plumber.

   (4) Direct corporation stop connections (taps) shall not exceed one and one-half (11/2) inches in diameter for six (6) inch mains. Larger connections to mains of this size shall be wet connections.

   (5) Direct corporation stop connections (taps) shall not exceed two (2) inches in diameter for all mains larger than six (6) inches in diameter. All connections larger than two (2) inches shall be wet connections.

   (6) Tapping saddles shall be provided by the Licensed Master Plumber whenever, in the opinion of the Department, a pipe to be tapped lacks sufficient wall thickness to securely hold the corporation stop (tap).

(c) Spacing of corporations stops (taps) and wet connections.

   (1) No corporation stop (tap) or wet connection shall be inserted on a fitting or within twenty-four (24) inches of a hub, fitting, hydrant branch, dead end, etc.

   (2) The minimum spacing interval for corporation stops (taps) and wet connections shall be twelve (12) inches for both three quarter (3/4) inch and one (1) inch corporation stops (taps), and eighteen (18) inches for one and one-half (1 1/2) and two (2) inch corporation stops (taps) and wet connections.

   (3) No corporation stop (tap) or wet connection shall be installed below the horizontal diameter of the main.

(d) Location of corporation stops (taps) and wet connections. Water main corporation stops (taps) or wet connections shall be installed in front of the property to be supplied with water. All old taps or wet connections shall be plugged or destroyed prior to the installation of the new tap or wet connection, unless interruption of service to building occupants dictates that installation of the new tap or wet connection be completed prior to plugging or destroying the old tap or wet connection.

(e) Charges for corporation stops (taps) and wet connections. The charges for the installation of a corporation stop (tap) or a wet connection shall be as fixed by the New York City Water Board Water and Wastewater Rate Schedule.

(f) Permits at job site. Permits for corporation stops (taps), wet connections and plugs shall be displayed at the work site.

(g) Plugs. If an approved excavation for the removal or destruction of a single corporation stop (tap) reveals that the service pipe is supplied by two (2) or more corporation stops (taps), the Licensed Master Plumber making the excavation shall plug or destroy the additional corporation stops (taps). The Department will make its records relative to the location of any corporation stop (tap) to be plugged or destroyed available to the licensed plumber. The Licensed Master Plumber shall be solely responsible for locating the corporation stop (tap). A separate permit will be required for each corporation stop (tap) destroyed.

(h) Destruction of wet connections, corporation stops (taps) and three-way connections.

   (4) When a corporation stop (tap) or wet connection has been shut off and the service pipe connected thereto is not to be used, the Licensed Master Plumber shall take the necessary steps to plug the corporation stop (tap), as outlined above.

   (5) Three-way connections to be abandoned shall have all piping disconnected and removed from the branch hub of the three-way, and an approved plug inserted into the hub. The plug shall be anchored to the main as directed by the Department. All work shall be done by a Licensed Master Plumber, and the permittee shall pay all costs associated with shutting the main. When a three-way hub is not available, the existing three-way outlet shall be capped and anchored to the main. All work shall be consistent with the Standard Water Main Specifications of the Department of Design and Construction (DDC).

(i) Use of tap location electrical indicator. When a building is to be demolished and the Tap Location Electrical Indicator Permit has been obtained, the Department will assist a Licensed Master Plumber in locating a tap through the use of an electrical indicator. If the indicator fails to locate the tap within five (5) feet of the expected location, the Licensed Master Plumber will be relieved of the obligation to plug and destroy the tap. No refund or credit of the permit fee will be granted if the indicator fails to locate the tap.

(j) Sizes of corporation stops (taps) and services pipes. The size of the corporation stop (tap) and service pipe to supply a premise shall be determined by the water demand load (gpm) of the premises, as determined by fixture units. In premises used for commercial and industrial purposes, where it is not feasible to determine the size of the tap and service pipe as indicated above, these sizes shall be determined solely by the water demand load (gpm) of the premises. (Tables for determining the appropriate sizes of taps and service pipes are found in Appendix Tables #1, #2 and #3.) The minimum tap shall be three quarter (3/4) inch, and the service pipe shall be at least one (1) inch in diameter. Unless otherwise approved by the Department, all taps shall be the same size as their corresponding service pipes and the goosenecks required by 15 RCNY § 20-03(n) shall be the same size as the service pipes.

(k) Fire connections and supply.

   (1) Fire connections. The Department of Buildings shall determine the size of all fire service pipes to be installed. The size of corporation stops (taps) or wet connections for fire service pipes shall be subject to the approval of the Department. All fire connection sizes shall be as follows:

      (i) The size of the corporation stop (tap) or wet connection for fire service pipes up to, and including, four (4) inches in diameter shall be the same size as the fire service pipe.

      (ii) For fire service pipes larger than four (4) inches in diameter, the size of the wet connection shall be one size smaller than the size of the fire service pipe.

   (2) Combined service pipes/dual fire and domestic service pipes. A connection for domestic purposes may be made from a fire service pipe only upon approval of the Department of Buildings. For such installations, valve(s) and meter(s) must be installed as required by 15 RCNY § 20-05.

   (3) Prohibitions. Fire service pipes shall not be cross-connected with any system of piping except as described in 15 RCNY § 20-02(1)(2).

(l) Appointments for tapping, wet connections, and inspections.

   (1) The Licensed Master Plumber shall provide the Department with advance notification of the requested corporation stop (tap) or wet connection installation date.

   (2) An inspection shall also be requested by the Licensed Master Plumber before backfill is placed on new or repaired service pipes.

   (3) The Department shall schedule corporation stop (tap) and wet connection installations during business hours, for the next available date.

(m) Rescheduling of corporation stop (tap), wet connection installation or service pipe inspection.

   (1) When a permittee fails to provide a safe and adequately sized excavation for installation of a corporation stop (tap) or wet connection on the date and time for which an appointment has been scheduled, the installation will not be made and the permittee will be required to schedule a new appointment.

   (2) When a permittee fails to have a completed service pipe installation or plug ready for inspection on the date and time for which an inspection has been scheduled, the permittee will be required to schedule a new appointment.

   (3) If a permittee must leave an excavation open for a subsequent corporation stop (tap)/wet connection installation or service pipe inspection, the excavation shall be made safe, in accordance with DOT requirements.

(n) Size of excavation. Sizes of excavations for wet connections and corporation stops (taps) shall be in accordance with the requirements of Appendix Table #4. If subsurface conditions prevent a plumber from making an excavation of the dimensions indicated therein, the plumber shall immediately notify the Department. The Department has the discretion to determine whether the dimensions should be changed, and what the new dimensions for the excavation shall be. All excavations shall be made safe by sheeting and bracing, where necessary, and shall conform with all applicable laws, rules and regulations.

(o) Driven corporation stops (taps). Where a drive corporation stop (tap) is uncovered, it must be maintained and protected. If a driven corporation stop (tap) is disturbed, it must be replaced with a screw corporation stop.

(p) Service pipe leak.

   (1) Upon discovery of a leaking service pipe, the Department will shut the corporation stop (tap) or wet connection unless it determines that there is no immediate threat to life or property. When there is no immediate threat to life or property, a Three-Day Notice to Repair will be served upon the owner or occupant of the premises. If the notice is not complied with, the Department will shut the corporation stop (tap) or wet connection.

   (2) When the corporation stop (tap) or wet connection is shut off by the Department, the owner/occupant must engage a Licensed Master Plumber to assume responsibility for the street excavation and make the necessary repairs. If the owner/occupant fails to engage a Licensed Master Plumber, the corporation stop (tap) or wet connection will remain closed, the excavation will be backfilled, and the street will be properly restored.

(q) Shut-off of tap by licensed master plumber. A Licensed Master Plumber must secure a permit to open or shut a tap controlling a service pipe connected to a City water main for any repair, replacement or installation. If it is necessary to shut off the water main while repairing, replacing or installing a service pipe, the Licensed Master Plumber shall immediately notify the Department. The shut off shall be made only by the Department, and the permittee must pay all costs associated with shutting off the main. If a property is vacant and sealed longer than one year, the property owner must have the tap destroyed or plugged and the service line plugged. If the property owner fails to take this action, the Department may perform the work upon written notice to the property owner at the mailing address on file with the Department and assess the cost to the property owner.






*§ 20-03 Water Service Pipes.* ::


(a)  Advance conceptual design approval.

   (1) A Licensed Professional Engineer, Registered Architect or Licensed Master Plumber may obtain advance conceptual design approval for corporation stops (taps), wet connections, service pipes or relays by submitting a conceptual design drawing to the Department and paying the required fee. Information on the related water demand, length of service pipe, proposed size of the corporation stop (tap)/wet connection, service pipe and fire sprinkler heads to be utilized must also be provided.

   (2) The advance review and approval of a conceptual design may be the basis for a permit application for a period of two (2) years.

   (3) Prior to the expiration of an advance conceptual design approval, the Department may extend the approval for an additional sixty (60) days upon receipt of a written request for an extension.

      (iv) Single-jet, electromagnetic, or other meters designed for variable flow rates shall be used on services one-and-a-half (11/2) inch and larger in diameter and operating on street pressure, and may be used in buildings with booster pumps or pressurized system applications.

      (v) Single-jet meters shall be installed on a level horizontal plane +/- 10 degrees. Turbine, electromagnetic, and other meter types may be installed on an incline or vertical plane if a horizontal installation is not possible and the configuration is supported by the meter manufacturer's specifications. The meter register must always face outward for reading.

   (2) An approved flat plate or "Z" meter strainer shall be installed on all new or replacement turbine meter installations, unless the turbine meter is manufactured with an internal strainer. Such a strainer is not required for electromagnetic or single-jet meters, but its use is permitted.

   (3) [Repealed.]

   (4) [Repealed.]

(f) Used or repaired meters. No used or repaired meter shall be installed to cover a service pipe at the same or a different location unless it has been repaired, tested for accuracy, found to conform to AWWA new meter accuracy standards and has been approved by the Department.

(g) Sizing.

   (1) A meter shall be restricted to a size and type that will insure accurate registration on the basis of the water requirements of the premises, or portion of the premises, to be metered. For residential premises, the permit applicant shall perform a fixture count and develop a peak flow estimate using Appendix Tables #1 and #2. The meter shall be sized according to Appendix Table #8. For non-residential premises, the flow rate shall be based on the analysis of a Licensed Professional Engineer or Registered Architect. The meter shall be sized according to that flow rate and Appendix Table #8.

   (2) A meter shall not be larger than the service pipe supplying the meter, the piping in the meter setting, or the water distribution piping in the building, unless specifically approved in writing by the Department or as noted in 15 RCNY § 20-05(a)(5) for two-and-one-half (2 1/2) inch fire services or combined services. If two meters both cover the calculated peak flow rate, the smaller of the two meters shall be used unless approved in writing by the Department. Unless a fixture count and flow analysis, as described in 15 RCNY § 20-05(g)(1), has been approved by the Department, a one- or two-family home with gravity-flush water closets shall not have a meter on a domestic service without fire sprinklers larger than three-quarters (3/4)) inch and three-, four-, five- and six-family homes shall not have a meter on a domestic service larger than one (1) inch. Exceptions to these requirements, and the use of Appendix Table #8 for meter sizing, will be considered by the Department only when a building's plumbing system uses only street water pressure and documented incoming water pressure is less than 35 psi for buildings four (4) through six (6) stories high, or less than 30 psi for buildings less than four (4) stories in height.

   (3) The minimum size meter for new installations and replacements shall be five-eighths (5/8) inch.

   (4) The appropriate low-flow range for compound meters varies with the manufacturer. The ranges of sizes in Appendix Table #8 refer to the high-flow side. The Department may require that a permit applicant provide a basis for using a compound meter instead of another type of meter. That justification must outweigh the higher maintenance and other operating costs to the Department of the compound meter.

(h) Tests. The permit applicant shall submit the manufacturer's meter accuracy test results to the Department at the time of permit application. The Department retains the right, in specific instances, to require that a new, used or repaired meter be sent to a designated Department facility for testing at the owner's expense.

(i) Settings. Notwithstanding any other provisions to the contrary, all meters shall be set or reset according to the following requirements:

   (1) Meters shall be set as near as possible to the point of entry of the service pipe through the building or vault wall and shall be placed so that they may be easily inspected, maintained and replaced. Evaporative cooling tower meters or other meters used to calculate a wastewater allowance when located downstream of a billing meter shall be placed as close to the end use as practical. A property owner shall not erect or maintain any physical barrier that prevents access to, or repair or replacement of, the water meter.

      (i) Displacement meters shall not be set beyond three (3) feet of the entry point without written approval from the Department.

      (ii) Turbine and compound meters shall be set with straight sections of pipe as provided in Appendix Figures #7, #7A, #9, #9A, #10 and #10A. If pipe lengths cannot conform to those indicated in Appendix Figures #7, #7A, #9, #9A, #10 and #10A, a meter technology shall be used which does not require minimum straight pipe lengths. The Department shall identify such meter technologies in its list of approved meters. An approved meter strainer is required unless one is included in the meter design or in the case of single-jet or electromagnetic meters, is not required by the meter manufacturer.

   (2) No fittings capable of a branch connection shall be permitted in the section of pipe upstream of the meter or meter setter with the exception of an approved strainer. The strainer shall be located immediately before the inlet side of the meter. The service pipe between the point of entry and the meter setting shall be kept visible. No fittings, devices, or equipment shall be permitted in the section of pipe upstream or downstream of the meter that interferes with the required laminar flow through the meter.

   (3) If conditions exist that prevent the setting of a meter in accordance with the above requirements, the meter may be set outside the building in a meter pit, vault or above-ground meter box (See 15 RCNY § 20-05(k)).

   (4) Meter settings shall have an inlet valve immediately upstream of the meter and any strainer, and an outlet valve downstream of the meter. For meters two (2) inches in size or smaller, the valves shall be full-port ball valves. For meters larger than two (2) inches in size, the valves shall be rising stem, resilient seated, and epoxy-coated gate valves. If a backflow prevention device is located after the meter setting and both the backflow prevention device and meter setting are located on the same floor of a building, then an outlet valve serving both the backflow prevention device and meter setting may be placed immediately after the device. If the backflow prevention device and meter setting are located on different floors of a building, each set of equipment shall have its own outlet valve and test tee.

      (i) Except for meters two (2) inches or smaller where space constraints prevent any approved meter technology from being installed with an inlet valve, or as noted in 15 RCNY § 20-05(a)(5), a house control valve shall not be used in lieu of a meter inlet valve.

      (ii) A meter outlet valve is not required for fire meters on a dedicated fire service or the fire service branch of a combined service, for a Detector Check Valve Assembly or if the property has approved backflow prevention equipment which includes an outlet valve.

      (iii) A plain tip test tee shall be provided before the meter outlet valve or incorporated into the design of the meter outlet valve. For meters up to two (2) inches in diameter, the test tee shall be the same size as the meter. For meters larger than two (2) inches in diameter, the test tee shall be two (2) inches. An exception shall be provided for installations using an outlet valve that incorporates an one-and-a-half (1 1/2) inch rather than two (2) inch test tee into the design of its two (2) inch outlet valve. Factory-fabricated setters five-eights (5/8) inch through two (2) inches shall have test ports as described in paragraph 6 of this subdivision. Test port plugs on meter bodies shall be drilled for seal wire. Test tees are not to be used as connections for domestic service. Where a meter is placed in a pit alongside a sewer trap, the meter test tee shall be located outside of the pit in an accessible location.

   (5) Connections shall be made by coupling, union, flange union or approved compression fittings and bored for sealing with holes not less than three thirty-seconds (3/32) of an inch in diameter. Compression fittings are permitted for three quarter (3/4) inch through two (2) inch meters only. Unions, couplings or compression fittings that permit removal of the meter and/or setter without breaking the seal wire are prohibited. Grooved end mechanical pipe joining systems are not permitted between the meter inlet valve and the outlet side of the meter. If used on the service side of the house valve, such systems shall be drilled for seal wire. In all other circumstances, pipe joining specifications shall conform to the New York City Plumbing Code. All water meter settings of two (2) inches and smaller sizes shall utilize valves and fittings constructed of bronze with a lead content that shall not exceed current NSF/ANSI Standard 61 limits. Bolts, studs, nuts, screws and other external fastening devices shall be made of a bronze alloy or stainless steel conforming to AWWA standards, and shall be designed for easy removal following lengthy service.

(a)  For each solid waste or recyclable materials contract that specifies that all diesel fuel-powered motor vehicles and diesel fuel-powered nonroad vehicles used in the performance of such contract that operate primarily within the city of New York shall utilize BART, the contractor operating such vehicle must identify, in list form, all types of pollution control technology devices verified for such vehicle at classification Level 4.

(b) All types of pollution control technology devices identified by the contractor as classification Level 4 devices that are not technologically feasible for use with respect to the particular vehicle, engine or application are to be eliminated from such list. To eliminate all types of pollution control technology devices identified by the contractor at classification Level 4, or a specific type of pollution control technology, or a particular pollution control technology device, the contractor must demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Commissioner that operational constraints or physical, chemical or engineering principles preclude the successful and effective use of the vehicle when used with such types of technology devices, or type of technology, or particular pollution control technology device.

(c) If, after the elimination process, no pollution control technology devices remain in classification Level 4 from which the contractor can select a BART, the same identification and elimination process must be done for classification Level 3. If, after the elimination process, no pollution control technology devices remain in classification Level 3 from which the contractor can select a BART, the same identification and elimination process must be done for classification Level 2. If, after the elimination process, no pollution control technology devices remain in classification Level 2 from which the contractor can select a BART, the same identification and elimination process must be done for classification Level 1.

(d) Once a level is selected as provided for in subdivisions (a), (b), and (c) of this section, an economic impact analysis is to be performed on the remaining technologies where the technology reduces both PM and nitrogen oxide (NOx). The contractor shall select the technology achieving, at a reasonable cost, the greatest reduction in NOx emissions. If the NOx emission does not meet the reasonable cost test, the technology that achieves the greatest PM reduction from the other remaining technologies must be selected.






*§ 27-06 Best Available Retrofit Technology Selection Applicability.* ::


No contractor shall be required to replace a selected BART within three years of having first utilized such technology. Furthermore, no contractor shall be required to replace Level 4 technology until it has reached the end of its useful life.

Chapter 28: Citywide Construction Noise Mitigation
--------------------------------------------------



*§ 28-100 General Construction Noise Mitigation Plan.* ::


In accordance with § 24-219 of the New York City Noise Code, every construction site where construction activities take place shall have, conspicuously posted, a complete and accurate Construction Noise Mitigation Plan. So long as the plan complies with this chapter, it need not be filed with the Department of Environmental Protection (DEP); however, such plan must be readily available for inspection at the construction site. The Construction Noise Mitigation Plan Form is available at: http://www.nyc.gov/dep or at DEP's Offices at:

New York City Department of Environmental Protection Bureau of Environmental Compliance, 9th Floor 59-17 Junction Blvd. Flushing, NY 11373.






*§ 28-101 Required Noise Mitigation Measures for General Construction.* ::


a. The responsible party shall self-certify in its Construction Noise Mitigation Plan that all construction tools and equipment have been maintained so that they operate at normal manufacturer's operating specifications, including at peak loading. Such self-certification shall be indicated on the Construction Noise Mitigation Plan form required by 15 RCNY § 28-100. Upon a DEP inspection of the work site, DEP shall use the noise level guidelines in the Federal Highway Administration Roadway Construction Noise Model User's Guide, Jan. 2006, page 3, located in the Appendix to this chapter, as a means of identifying equipment that may be the cause of a noise complaint. If an individual piece of equipment is identified by DEP as exceeding the level specified in such Guide located in the Appendix to this chapter, upon notification by DEP, the responsible party shall have the option of: (i) performing maintenance to demonstrate a good faith effort, notwithstanding the model year of the equipment, to mitigate the noise by a measurable level acceptable to the Department, (ii) replacing the equipment with equipment that complies with said level, or (iii) filing an Alternative Noise Mitigation Plan pursuant to 15 RCNY § 28-104, within five business days of said inspection. If the responsible party elects to perform maintenance pursuant to option (i), but cannot demonstrate within five business days a reduction in noise by a measurable level acceptable to the Department, such party shall pursue one of the other two options to the satisfaction of the Department. The failure to exercise and complete one of such three options within five business days of said inspection shall be a violation of this rule.

b. All construction equipment being operated on site must be equipped with the appropriate manufacturer's noise reduction device(s), including, but not limited to, a manufacturer's muffler (or equivalently rated material) that is free of rust, holes and exhaust leaks.

c. The responsible party shall mitigate noise from construction devices with internal combustion engines by ensuring that the engine's housing doors are kept closed, and by using noise-insulating material mounted on the engine housing that does not interfere with the manufacturer's guidelines for engine operation or exhaust. The responsible party shall further reduce noise by operating the device at lower engine speeds during the work to the maximum extent possible.

d. Portable compressors, generators, pumps and other such devices shall be covered with noise-insulating fabric to the maximum extent possible that does not interfere with the manufacturer's guidelines for engine operation or exhaust, and shall further reduce noise by operating the device at lower engine speeds during the work to the maximum extent possible.

e. Vehicle engine idling on site shall be prevented in accordance with New York City Administrative Code § 24-163.

f. Quieter back-up alarms shall be used in pre-2008 model year vehicles when practicable for the job site. 2008 model year or newer vehicles shall be equipped with a quieter back-up warning device in accordance with OSHA standards, as set forth in paragraph 4 of subdivision d of 15 RCNY § 28-102.

g. When DOB regulations require a perimeter barrier, or "construction fence," and the site is within 200 feet of a receptor or a receiving property as defined in 15 RCNY § 28-109, perimeter noise barriers shall be fabricated in accordance with the standards set forth in subdivision e of 15 RCNY § 28-107 and lined with material set forth in subdivisions c and e of 15 RCNY § 28-107. Further, the responsible party shall fill in any gaps and holes in adjacent panels of noise barriers with noise attenuation material, so as to maximize the effectiveness of such barriers. Such noise attenuation material shall include noise curtain material, additional plywood, or similar material. When viewing ports are required in the curtain material, they shall be filled in with clear plastic attached to the curtain.

h. The contractor shall create and utilize a noise mitigation training program, which shall be implemented for all field-worker supervisory personnel including sub-contractor supervisors. Supervisory personnel shall field-train all field workers to minimize construction noise. Such training program shall be developed in consultation with DEP.

i. When work is planned near sensitive receptors, including but not limited to facilities such as schools, hospitals, places of worship, and homes for the aging, the responsible party shall cooperate with the facility owner or operator to coordinate the work schedule so as to minimize the noise impact on the facility.

j. A DEP inspector may visit a construction site to examine the Noise Mitigation Plan upon receiving a complaint, or as a matter of routine inspection, to ensure that the responsible party is complying with such Plan. A responsible party found not to be complying with such Plan shall be provided a cure period of three business days to correct the condition or to file an Alternative Noise Mitigation Plan under 15 RCNY § 28-104. If the condition is not corrected nor an Alternative Noise Mitigation Plan filed with DEP within three business days, then a Notice of Violation shall be issued against the responsible party. Said violations may be issued on-site or by mail. Notwithstanding the preceding sentences in this subdivision, there shall be no cure period afforded with respect to compliance with 15 RCNY §§ 28-100; 28-101(a), (b), (e), (f), (h); 28-104; 28-105; and 28-106(a), (b), (d) (g) &amp; (i).

k. Construction activities may take place during the hours of 7:00 a.m. to 6:00 p.m. on weekdays. At all other times, the permitee shall obtain after-hours authorization, pursuant to 15 RCNY § 28-103.

l. Where construction projects are of shorter duration of less than 15 days and within the property line and do not require Department of Buildings (DOB) perimeter barriers ("construction fences"), and where the work site is within 75 feet of a residential receptor, a temporary or portable (i.e. unanchored) noise barrier shall be fabricated in accordance with the specifications in 15 RCNY § 28-108. For long-term street work, defined as 15 days or longer, that is outside the property line and within 75 feet of a residential receptor and where there is a dedicated lane available, a temporary barrier in accordance with the specifications in 15 RCNY § 28-108 shall be required.

m. Whenever a responsible party is engaged in sandblasting operations that require a perimeter or other barrier during sandblasting, said barrier shall be lined with noise barrier material as set forth in subdivision e of 15 RCNY § 28-107.

n. Responsible parties conducting construction and roadway work that will commence and be completed within a continuous period of no longer than 24 hours, that occurs between the hours of 7:00 a.m. and 6:00 p.m. on weekdays, need not post or file with DEP a Construction Noise Mitigation Plan. However, the responsible party for such construction work shall not create unreasonable noise. In addition, if the work occurs near or adjacent to a sensitive receptor as defined in 15 RCNY § 28-101(i), then the responsible party shall make modifications including scheduling changes or employing additional noise mitigation methods listed in 15 RCNY §§ 28-102, 28-107, and 28-108. This subdivision shall not apply to construction work that occurs after hours.

o. Technical terms in these rules are defined in the Noise Code or in 15 RCNY § 28-109.






*§ 28-102 Construction Devices and Activities.* ::


The devices listed in this section require additional noise mitigation. A responsible party using any of these devices shall mitigate the noise by following the rules set forth in this section for the specific device. There are five categories of devices:

a. Impact Equipment: Pile Drivers, Jackhammers, Hoe Rams, Blasting.b. Earth Moving Devices: Vacuum Excavators.c. Construction Trucks: Dump Trucks.d. Stationary Devices: Cranes, Auger Drills, Street Plates, Backup Alarms.e. Manual Devices: Concrete Saws. If the responsible party cannot in good faith comply with the noise mitigation rules for each device, the responsible party shall file with DEP an Alternative Noise Mitigation Plan in accordance with 15 RCNY § 28-104.

a. Impact Equipment.

   1. Pile Drivers. This rule provides noise mitigation strategies that responsible parties shall utilize in order to reduce the noise emissions from pile driving and related equipment. Pile drivers for sheet piles and/or column piles are a common necessity on a construction project. Piles can be used to stabilize trench walls during excavation, create coffer dams to hold back water, or to provide an anchored platform upon which structures can be built. There are two basic types of pile drivers – impact hammers and vibratory drivers. Noise emission levels from pile drivers can vary widely based on the type of driver, the type of pile (steel, concrete, wood), and the underlying ground conditions.

      A. GENERAL RULES OF OPERATION

         i. The hours of operation shall be in accordance with 15 RCNY § 28-103.

      B. SOURCE CONTROLS: QUIETER MODELS &amp; MUFFLERS

         i. The quietest pile driving method shall be selected that allows the work to be performed based on structural, geotechnical, and pile friction requirements and ground conditions. The following list or their equivalent are acceptable pile-driving methods to the Department: a hydraulic pile pushing system, a vibratory pile driver; a hydraulic impact pile driver; a drop hammer, a diesel impact pile driver.

         ii. Hydraulic pushing method pile drivers, including the Ken-Jet Still Worker, the Giken Silent Piler, or the SERF Pilemaster, or equivalent, shall be utilized rather than louder impact or vibratory pile drivers when ground conditions permit such use. Further, such quieter pile drivers shall be utilized whenever a responsible party is working within 100 feet of a receptor.

         iii. In accordance with the noise mitigation criteria outlined in 15 RCNY § 28-101(b), an impact pile driver shall be equipped with a well maintained exhaust muffler in order to mitigate the amount of noise escaping out with the diesel exhaust.

         iv. The responsible party shall select the type of pile being driven based on structural and/or geotechnical performance requirements. In order of loudness , wooden piles shall be preferred first, followed by concrete piles, and then steel piles.

         v. The responsible party shall pre-auger or pre-trench the pile holes to soften the underlying ground, reduce ground resistance, and thus reduce pile driving noise based upon geotechnical conditions at the location. Auger drill rigs may be mounted to the same crane as the pile driver or alternatively, an excavator with a long bucket arm may pre-trench as deep as 25 feet below grade.

         vi. A properly secured impact cushion shall be installed on top of piles that are being driven by an impact hammer. Commercially available pile cushions or those fabricated on the job site, out of scrap wood, leather or rubber, may be utilized.

         vii. Quieter alternative methods to pile driving, including the use of drilled caissons filled with concrete, or slurry walls dug out initially with a milling machine, shall be used whenever possible, depending on structural and geotechnical performance requirements.

         viii. Noise bellows systems such as the IHC Hydrohammer, or an equivalent bellows device, may be used to provide further noise attenuation. Bellows enclosures accompany the pile down to the ground and collapse accordion style as the pile reaches the ground.

         ix. When the responsible party uses a vibratory pile driver or a hydraulic impact pile driver as set forth in clause (ii) of this subparagraph and/or noise bellows as set forth in clause (viii) of this subparagraph, between the hours of 7:00 a.m. to 6:00 p.m. on weekdays, the responsible party need not utilize additional pathway controls listed in subparagraph C of this paragraph, unless the responsible party is performing work within 35 feet of an indoor receptor and with the exception of any required perimeter barriers as specified in 15 RCNY § 28-101(g).

         x. No violation shall be issued to the responsible party if the bellows in clause (viii) of this subparagraph B or the barriers listed in subparagraph C of this paragraph are adjusted such that the operator can view the end of the hammer for safety purposes.

      C. NOISE PATHWAY CONTROLS: NOISE BARRIERS &amp; ENCLOSURES. The responsible party shall utilize one of the following pathway controls. However, if the Department receives noise complaints concerning the site, the responsible party shall utilize additional pathway controls listed in this subparagraph as required by DEP.

         i. The responsible party shall construct a portable noise barrier that shall be free from gaps and holes and constructed of a sufficiently massive material to achieve a Sound Transmission Class rating of STC 30 or greater. It shall be positioned as close as possible to the pile driver. A portable (i.e. unanchored) noise barrier can be made, for example, of concrete jersey bases with 3/4-inch plywood panels attached to fence posts extending upwards to an overall height of 15 feet. This shall be the maximum height for a free-standing barrier in order to avoid it tipping over from wind load. Multiple jersey bases and plywood panels shall be positioned adjacent to one another to form a barrier of any desired length. The gaps between adjacent panels shall be filled-in with noise curtain material, additional plywood, or similar material when practicable. A properly balanced canted panel, not susceptible to windy conditions, may be placed on top of the barrier in order to provide better shielding for multi-story receptors. However, said barrier's height shall not exceed 15 feet including the balanced canted portion.

         ii. The noise barrier shall be long and tall enough to completely block the line of sight between the pile driver and any indoor receptor within 200 feet and that is a maximum of 20 feet above grade level, when work occurs. The barrier should be placed as close to the actual pile driving work as feasible. Greater noise attenuation occurs when barriers are placed as close as possible to the noise source.

         iii. Where applicable, portable noise shields made of steel frames wrapped with noise curtain material, such as SoundSeal model BBC-13-2, or equivalently rated material, shall be hoisted up into position on the crane's second cable to form a noise barrier in the direction of sensitive receptors. The shield shall be large enough to completely block the line of sight between the receptors and the pile driver, and shall be lowered to the ground as the pile is being driven in order to maintain the shielding effect. Such portable noise shield shall be utilized when the pile driver is higher than any barrier at the site required under 15 RCNY § 28-101(g).

         iv. Alternative barriers may be utilized in accordance with site-specific conditions. For example, shipping container (Conex) boxes or truck trailers may be positioned along the edge of the work site to form an effective semi-permanent noise barrier. Sufficient space at the site is necessary, as these containers are generally 8 feet wide by 8 feet tall and can be double-stacked to form a noise barrier 16 feet in height. The gaps between and/or under container boxes shall be filled-in with heavy vinyl noise curtains or similar materials. It should be noted that gaps and spaces are one of the primary contributors to degrading a noise barrier's performance.

   2. Jackhammers/Pavement Breakers. This rule shall provide noise mitigation strategies that the responsible party shall utilize in order to reduce the noise emissions from jackhammers and pavement breakers. These devices are defined as manually-operated, powered (pneumatic or other) devices, consisting of chisel-hammers or bits used to cut or break through pavement, concrete, or street surfaces. Jackhammers can be very loud as the steel chisel or bit hits the target object.

      A. GENERAL RULES OF OPERATION

         i. The hours of operation shall be in accordance with the rules as set forth in 15 RCNY § 28-103.

      B. SOURCE CONTROLS: QUIETER MODELS &amp; MUFFLERS

         i. Quieter makes and models of jackhammers such as the Copco model TEX P90S or equivalent model with an elongated effective muffler casing or bellows measuring a total of greater than 15 inches in length, shall be used whenever practicable.

         ii. The quietest jackhammer suitable to perform the given work shall be selected for use. The quieter jackhammers, including the jackhammer specified in clause (i) of this subparagraph or the Chicago Pneumatic CP1240, with a model F-814004 muffler, or equivalent, shall be used when suitable and whenever a responsible party is working in close proximity to receptors, whenever a responsible party is using multiple jackhammers, and whenever jackhammer operations are occurring during after hours as set forth in § 24-223 of the Administrative Code.

         iii. In all cases, jackhammers shall be equipped with an effective muffler, provided either from the manufacturer or from an aftermarket vendor, which effectively reduces noise from the exhaust air by about 4 dBA or more. In accordance with 15 RCNY § 28-101(b), an effective muffler shall be properly fitted to the jackhammer to insure against air or noise leakage.

         iv. If appropriate to the size of the job, smaller jackhammers shall be used, as they tend to be quieter.

         v. When the responsible party uses a device described in clause (i) of this subparagraph between the hours of 7:00 a.m. to 6:00 p.m. on weekdays, the responsible party need not utilize additional pathway controls listed in subparagraph C of this paragraph, unless the responsible party is performing work within 35 feet of an indoor receptor and with the exception of any required perimeter barriers as specified in 15 RCNY § 28-101(g).

      C. NOISE PATHWAY CONTROLS: NOISE BARRIERS &amp; ENCLOSURES. The responsible party shall utilize one of the following pathway controls for jackhammers or pavement breaker operations within a property line or for long-term work when outside of the property line as specified in 15 RCNY § 28-106(p) or 15 RCNY § 28-101(l). However, if the Department receives noise complaints concerning the site, the responsible party shall utilize additional pathway controls listed in this subparagraph as required by DEP. The pathway controls are set forth as follows: jersey barriers, tents, or other portable noise barriers.

         i. The responsible party shall construct a portable noise barrier that shall be free from gaps and holes and constructed of a sufficiently massive material to achieve a Sound Transmission Class rating of STC 30 or greater and that shall be positioned as close as possible to the jack hammer. The noise barrier shall be long and tall enough to completely block the line of sight between the jackhammer and any indoor receptor within 200 feet and that is a maximum of 20 feet above grade level, when work occurs. The barrier shall be placed as close to the actual jackhammering work as feasible. Greater noise attenuation occurs when barriers are placed as close as possible to the noise source. A balanced canted panel, not susceptible to high winds shall be placed, when feasible, on top of the barrier in order to provide better shielding for multi-story receptors. However, said barrier's height shall not exceed 15 feet including the balanced canted portion.

         ii. Jersey barriers. A portable (i.e. unanchored) noise barrier can be made, for example, of concrete jersey bases with 3/4-inch plywood panels attached to fence posts extending upwards to an overall height of 15 feet. This shall be the maximum height for a free-standing barrier in order to avoid it tipping over from wind load. Multiple jersey bases and plywood panels can be positioned adjacent to one another to form a barrier of any desired length. The gaps between adjacent panels should be filled-in with noise curtain material, additional plywood, or similar material. All jersey barriers shall comply with the requirements in clause (i) of this subparagraph, including a Sound Transmission Class rating of STC 30 or greater.

         iii. Portable noise enclosures.

            (a) Portable noise enclosures (so-called "noise tents") made of steel frames wrapped with noise curtain material, such as SoundSeal model BBC-13-2, or equivalently rated material, may be built to surround the jackhammer (on the top and 3 sides) and the operator. A properly constructed enclosure, using curtain material with a Sound Transmission Class rating of STC 30 or greater, generally provides a 5 dBA insertion loss. Such barrier shall meet OSHA standards for worker exposure to particulate matter.

            (b) The responsible party shall utilize multiple tents for multiple jackhammers. For example, when two jackhammers are being utilized and they cannot fit under the same noise tent, the responsible party shall provide an additional noise tent.

            (c) The noise tent shall be moved as the jackhammer work progresses in order to maintain the tent's ability to block the line of sight between the jackhammer and the receptors.

            (d) In accordance with § 24-223 of the Administrative Code, when emergency jackhammering occurs after normal working hours within 500 feet of any residential receptor, the responsible party shall use noise tents with double thick noise curtain material or a noise tent augmented with a portable noise barrier to form a double layer of mitigation. See 15 RCNY § 28-108. Quieter jackhammers and compressor vehicles shall also be utilized during after hours work whenever feasible.

            (e) Where there are receptors surrounding the jackhammer work site on all sides, two tents shall be used on either side of the jackhammer to form a complete enclosure as close to the jackhammer as practicable.

   3. Hoe Rams. This rule shall provide noise mitigation strategies that the responsible party shall utilize in order to reduce the noise emissions from hoe rams. Hoe rams, and hoe ram-like devices, are used to cut through roadway pavement or concrete walls and for demolition of large concrete or steel structures. They are typically large hydraulic chisel-hammers attached on the end of a backhoe or excavator arm that can be very loud as the steel chisel hits the target object.

      A. GENERAL RULES OF OPERATION

         i. The hours of operation shall be in accordance with the rules as set forth in 15 RCNY § 28-103.

      B. SOURCE CONTROLS: QUIETER MODELS &amp; MUFFLERS

         i. Quieter makes and models of hoe rams, such as the Bosma Hammer-Head or equivalent quieter devices, shall be used whenever feasible, especially near receptors.

         ii. The smallest hoe ram necessary shall be selected to perform the task, as smaller devices tend to produce less noise.

         iii. A noise shroud enclosure shall be wrapped around the head (i.e. chisel) of the hoe ram whenever working within 200 feet of a receptor. Shrouds may be selected from various manufacturers such as Krupp Industries, Allied Hi-Ram, Montabert, or Rammer Inc. with steel shrouds to attach to the hoe ram head. Alternatively, a shroud may be fabricated on-site by wrapping the chisel head with a heavy vinyl noise curtain material, such as SoundSeal BBC-13-2, or equivalently rated material, and securing it with tie wire.

         iv. A skilled hoe ram operator can significantly affect the amount of noise produced during the work. In accordance with 15 RCNY § 28-101(h), responsible party and sub-contractor personnel shall be trained on the proper angle or position when the hoe ram chisel is placed against the work. The operator shall position and operate the device in such a manner as to minimize its noise output. A violation shall only be issued for failure to train the operator as set forth in subdivision (h) of 15 RCNY § 28-101.

         v. Alternative methods to hoe ramming concrete, including hydraulic jacks or chemical splitting (use of expansive demolition agents), shall be utilized whenever feasible. For steel demolition, alternative quieter methods may include the use of hydraulic shears and grapples, or the use of torches to cut the steel into more manageable pieces, which can then be trucked off-site for further demolition.

         vi. When the responsible party uses specific makes and models as set forth in clause (i) of this subparagraph or a noise shroud as set forth in clause (iii) of this subparagraph, between the hours of 7:00 a.m. to 6:00 p.m. on weekdays, then the responsible party need not utilize additional pathway controls listed in subparagraph C of this paragraph, unless the responsible party is performing work within 35 feet of an indoor receptor and with the exception of any required perimeter barriers as specified in 15 RCNY § 28-101(g).

         vii. No violation shall be issued to the responsible party if any of the shrouds in clause (iii) of this subparagraph are adjusted such that the operator can view the end of the bit for safety purposes.

      C. NOISE PATHWAY CONTROLS: NOISE BARRIERS &amp; ENCLOSURES. The responsible party shall utilize one of the following pathway controls below. However, if the Department receives noise complaints concerning the site, the responsible party shall utilize additional pathway controls listed in this subparagraph as required by DEP.

         i. The responsible party shall construct a portable noise barrier that shall be free from gaps and holes and constructed of sufficiently massive material to achieve a Sound Transmission Class rating of STC 30 or greater and shall be positioned as close as possible to the hoe ram. A portable (i.e. unanchored) noise barrier can be made, for example, of concrete jersey bases with 3/4-inch plywood panels attached to fence posts extending upwards to a overall height of 15 feet. This shall be the maximum height for a free-standing barrier in order to avoid it tipping over from wind load. Multiple jersey bases and plywood panels can be positioned adjacent to one another to form a barrier of any desired length. The gaps between adjacent panels should be filled-in with noise curtain material, additional plywood, or similar material. A balanced canted panel, not susceptible to high winds shall be placed, when feasible, on top of the barrier in order to provide better shielding for multi-story receptors. However, said barrier's height shall not exceed 15 feet including the balanced canted portion.

         ii. The noise barrier shall be long and tall enough to completely block the line of sight between the hoe ram and any indoor receptor within 200 feet and that is a maximum of 20 feet above grade level, when work occurs. The barrier should be placed as close to the actual hoe ram work as feasible. Greater noise attenuation occurs when barriers are placed as close as possible to the noise source.

         iii. Alternative barriers may be utilized in accordance with site-specific conditions. For example, shipping container (Conex) boxes or truck trailers may be positioned along the edge of the work site to form a semi-permanent noise barrier. Sufficient space must be available since containers are generally 8 feet wide by 8 feet tall and can be double-stacked to form a noise barrier 16 feet in height. The gaps between and/or under container boxes should be filled-in with heavy vinyl noise curtains or similar material.

         iv. Where there are receptors surrounding the hoe ram work site on all sides, several noise barriers shall be used to form a complete enclosure around the hoe ram.

   4. Blasting. This rule shall provide noise mitigation strategies that the responsible party shall utilize in order to reduce the noise emissions from blasting. The controlled use of explosives is occasionally necessary on a construction site, primarily to loosen hard rock ledges or to demolish large concrete structures. This rule does not apply to tunneling activities subject to the regulations set forth in § 24-246 of the Administrative Code.

      A. GENERAL RULES OF OPERATION

         i. The hours of operation shall be in accordance with the rules as set forth in 15 RCNY § 28-103.

         ii. The necessary and FDNY-regulated use of blasting shall be done in close coordination with the affected public in order to minimize potential disturbance.

      B. SOURCE CONTROLS:

         i. The smallest appropriate blasting charge possible shall be used in order to minimize blasting noise at its source. The quietest explosive material possible shall also be selected. Relatively slow-burning explosives produce quieter noise emissions as compared to faster-burning explosives.

      C. NOISE PATHWAY CONTROLS: BLAST MATS AND BARRIERS

         i. Blast mats made of heavy rubber shall be laid over the blast site.

         ii. When blasting occurs close to receptors, the responsible party shall construct a portable noise barrier that shall be free from gaps and holes, constructed of a sufficiently massive material to achieve a Sound Transmission Class rating of STC 30 or greater, and positioned as close as possible to the blast site.

         iii. The noise barrier shall be long and tall enough to completely block the line of sight between the blasting and any indoor receptor within 200 feet and that is a maximum of 20 feet above grade level, when work occurs. A portable (i.e. unanchored) noise barrier can be made, for example, of concrete jersey bases with 3/4-inch plywood panels attached to fence posts extending upwards to a maximum height of 15 feet.

b. Earth Moving Equipment.

   1. Vacuum Excavators. This rule shall provide noise mitigation strategies the responsible party shall utilize when working with a vacuum excavator, or vac-truck. A vac-truck is a vehicle equipped with a low pressure suction hose leading to an on-board storage tank. Vac-trucks are generally used when removing dirt to avoid disrupting underground utility services such as telecommunications cables, water and sewer pipes, gas lines, or electrical cables.

      A. GENERAL RULES OF OPERATION

         i. The hours of operation shall be in accordance with the rules as set forth in 15 RCNY § 28-103.

      B. SOURCE CONTROLS: QUIETER MODELS &amp; SILENCERS

         i. Smaller capacity (lower suction) vac-trucks tend to be quieter and shall be used whenever practicable. Listed from the quietest to the loudest order, examples include GapVac, BSI Dewitz, BoVac and Guzzler.

         ii. Vac-trucks shall be run in their lower power setting whenever practicable. While suction capacity is reduced with lower engine speeds, there remains adequate suction to perform almost any job.

         iii. Several manufacturers do provide silencers on the air intake and exhaust sides of the blower. Heavier duty silencers including Universal, Industrial Acoustics, McGill and Burgess-Manning, or equivalent, shall be used whenever practicable.

         iv. The vac-truck's suction creating component (i.e. blower) shall be covered with a noise-reducing housing or enclosure.

         v. When the responsible party uses a specific vac-truck as set forth in clause (i) of this subparagraph and/or silencers specifically set forth in clause (iii) of this subparagraph between the hours of 7:00 a.m. to 6:00 p.m. on weekdays, then the responsible party need not utilize additional pathway controls listed in subparagraph C of this paragraph, unless the responsible party is performing work within 35 feet of an indoor receptor and with the exception of any required perimeter barriers as specified in 15 RCNY § 28-101(g).

      C. NOISE PATHWAY CONTROLS: NOISE BARRIERS &amp; CURTAINS. The responsible party shall utilize one of the following pathway controls below. However, if the Department receives noise complaints concerning the site, the responsible party shall utilize additional pathway controls listed in this subparagraph as required by DEP.

         i. The responsible party shall construct a portable noise barrier that shall be free of gaps and holes and constructed of a sufficiently massive material to achieve a Sound Transmission Class rating of STC 30, or greater, and shall be positioned as close as possible to the vac-truck. A portable (i.e. unanchored) noise barrier can be made, for example, of concrete jersey bases with 3/4-inch plywood panels attached to fence posts extending upwards to an overall height of 15 feet. This shall be the maximum height for a free-standing barrier in order to avoid it tipping over from wind load. Multiple jersey bases and plywood panels shall be positioned adjacent to one another to form a barrier of any desired length. The gaps between adjacent panels should be filled-in with noise curtain material, additional plywood, or similar material. A properly balanced canted panel, not susceptible to windy conditions, may be placed on top of the barrier in order to provide better shielding for multi-story receptors. However, such barrier's height shall not exceed 15 feet including the balanced canted portion.

         ii. The noise barrier shall be long and tall enough to completely block the line of sight between the vac-truck and any indoor receptor within 200 feet and that is a maximum of 20 feet above grade level, when work occurs. The barrier should be placed as close to the actual vac-truck work as feasible. Greater noise attenuation occurs when barriers are placed as close as possible to the noise source.

         iii. Portable noise shields made of steel frames wrapped with noise curtain material, such as SoundSeal model BBC-13-2, or equivalently rated material, shall be used to form a noise barrier in the direction of sensitive receptors and completely block the line of sight between the receptors and vac-truck. Noise curtains are typically made out of a 1/4-inch thick heavy vinyl material, often with a noise absorptive quilt attached to one side. These noise curtains generally weigh 1.5 lbs/sq. ft., have an STC rating of about 32, and come in 4-foot wide sheets complete with grommets and Velcro edges to aid in hanging the curtains and sealing the sheets side-by-side.

         iv. Alternative barriers may be utilized in accordance with site-specific conditions. For example, shipping container (Conex) boxes or truck trailers can be positioned along the edge of the work site to form a semi-permanent noise barrier. Sufficient space at the site is necessary as these containers are typically 8 feet wide by 8 feet tall and can be double-stacked to form a noise barrier 16 feet in height. The gaps between and/or under container boxes should be filled-in with heavy vinyl noise curtains or similar materials.

         v. Whenever possible, vac-truck exhaust shall be positioned and directed away from receptors.

c. Construction Trucks and Vehicles.

   1. Dump Trucks. This paragraph shall provide noise mitigation strategies that the responsible party shall utilize in order to reduce the noise emissions from dump trucks. Dump trucks are commonly used on construction sites in order to deliver construction materials, remove and excavate debris, or transfer materials around the job site. However they can produce loud noises when their tailgates are slammed when dumping a load, when their engines are revved with inadequate exhaust mufflers, when the first shovel-full is dropped into the bed, or due to use of their backup alarms.

      A. GENERAL RULES OF OPERATION

         i. The hours of operation shall be in accordance with the rules as set forth in 15 RCNY § 28-103.

      B. SOURCE CONTROLS

         i. The smallest sized and quietest dump truck that is adequate for a particular job shall be selected.

         ii. A bed liner made of thick rubber, spray-on liner, plywood, sand or gravel shall be installed to mitigate the noise of the first load being dropped into the dump truck.

         iii. Though not required for use in the United States (U.S.), most U.S. dump truck manufacturers produce quieter models for use in Europe. European Environmental Label (i.e. Blue Angel) low noise emission construction equipment, which is required for import and use in European Union (EU) nations in accordance with Quality Assurance Publication RAL UZ 53 and the Treaty on European Union 992-02-07 Journal C224, shall be used whenever feasible if it meets the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's emission requirements and/or regulations. These models are generally 10 dBA quieter than similar equipment used in the U.S.

         iv. The positioning of the dump truck shall be carefully selected in order to minimize operation near receptors. Responsible parties shall attempt to reduce the necessity of backing-up by selecting a straight drive-through truck route. If a backup alarm is used, a quieter warning device shall be installed in accordance with 15 RCNY § 28-101(f).

         v. The truck shall be equipped with an effective muffler in accordance with 15 RCNY § 28-101(b), which shall be well-maintained to ensure maximum noise reduction.

         vi. Slamming a tail gate shall be avoided to the extent possible to prevent unreasonable noise. Alternately, a pad made of heavy rubber, leather or wood, when practicable, shall be used under the tail gate to prevent metal contact.

         vii. The engine housing doors shall be kept closed while the engine is in operation.

         viii. When the responsible party uses quieter dump truck models as set forth in clause (iii) of this subparagraph, between the hours of 7:00 a.m. to 6:00 p.m. on weekdays, the responsible party need not utilize additional pathway controls listed in subparagraph C of this paragraph, unless the responsible party is performing work within 35 feet of an indoor receptor and with the exception of any required perimeter barriers as specified in 15 RCNY § 28-101(g).

      C. NOISE PATHWAY CONTROLS: NOISE BARRIERS &amp; CURTAINS The responsible party shall utilize one of the following pathway controls. However, if the Department receives noise complaints concerning the site, the responsible party shall utilize additional pathway controls listed in this subparagraph as required by DEP.

         i. The responsible party shall construct a portable noise barrier that shall be free from gaps and holes and constructed of a sufficiently massive material to achieve a Sound Transmission Class rating of STC 30, and shall be positioned as close as possible to the vehicle, in order to provide the greatest insertion loss. A portable (i.e. unanchored) noise barrier can be made, for example, of concrete jersey bases with 3/4-inch plywood panels attached to fence posts extending upwards to an overall height of 15 feet. This shall be the maximum height for a free-standing barrier in order to avoid it tipping over from wind load. Multiple jersey bases and plywood panels may be positioned adjacent to one another to form a barrier of any desired length. The gaps between adjacent panels shall be filled-in with noise curtain material, additional plywood, or similar material. A canted panel may be placed on top of the barrier in order to provide better shielding for multi-story receptors; however care must be taken to avoid having the barrier tip over from unbalanced loading. Further, said barrier's height shall not exceed 15 feet including the balanced canted portion.

         ii. The noise barrier shall be long and tall enough to completely block the line of sight between the dump truck and any indoor receptor within 200 feet and that is a maximum of 20 feet above grade level, when work occurs. The barrier shall be placed as close to the actual dump truck work as feasible. Greater noise attenuation occurs when barriers are placed as close as possible to the noise source.

         iii. Noise curtain material, such as SoundSeal model BBC-13-2, or equivalently rated material, shall be used to form a noise barrier in the direction of sensitive receptors and completely block the line of sight between the receptors and dump truck. It shall also be draped over the dump truck to augment the engine housing and exhaust stack. Noise curtains are typically made out of a 1/4-inch thick heavy vinyl material, often with a noise absorptive quilt attached to one side. These noise curtains generally weigh 1.5 lbs/sq. ft., have an STC rating of about 32, and come in 4-foot wide sheets complete with grommets and Velcro edges to aid in hanging the curtains and sealing the sheets side-by-side.

         iv. Conveyor belts shall be used whenever practicable, as they may allow the dump trucks to operate much farther away from receptors.

         v. Alternative barriers may be utilized in accordance with site-specific conditions. For example, shipping container (Conex) boxes or truck trailers may be positioned along the edge of the work site to form a semi-permanent noise barrier. Sufficient space at the site is necessary as these containers are generally 8 feet wide by 8 feet tall and can be double-stacked to form a noise barrier 16 feet in height. The gaps between and/or under container boxes shall be filled-in with heavy vinyl noise curtains or similar material.

d. Stationary Equipment.

   1. Cranes. This rule shall provide noise mitigation strategies that the responsible party shall utilize in order to reduce the noise emissions from cranes. Cranes are an essential piece of equipment on most large construction sites in order to load and unload delivery trucks, lift building materials to required heights, lift excavated materials out of tunnels and for other sub-surface excavations, and move other equipment and personnel around the job site. Cranes come in many varieties and sizes, including tracked or wheeled mobile cranes, fixed or floating derricks, and tower cranes.

      A. GENERAL RULES OF OPERATION

         i. The hours of operation shall be in accordance with the rules set forth in 15 RCNY § 28-103.

      B. SOURCE CONTROLS: QUIETER MODELS

         i. There are various makes and models that are inherently quieter than others. Smaller, quieter cranes, including rubber-tired mobile cranes, shall be used whenever possible based on load lifting requirements.

         ii. New modern hydraulic cranes shall be used whenever possible to avoid the squeal produced by cable drum brakes on mechanical cranes.

         iii. Though not required for use in the United States, most U.S. crane manufacturers produce quieter models for use in Europe. European Environmental Label (i.e. Blue Angel) low noise emission construction equipment, which is required for import and use in European Union (EU) nations in accordance with Quality Assurance Publication RAL UZ 53 and the Treaty on European Union 992-02-07 Journal C224, shall be used whenever feasible and if it meets the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's emission requirements and/or regulations. These cranes are about 10 dBA quieter than similar models sold in the U.S.

         iv. The positioning of the crane shall be carefully selected in order to minimize the need to relocate it around the job site. Whenever possible, tower cranes shall be used, as they essentially produce no noise at ground level.

         v. The crane shall be equipped with an effective muffler in accordance with 15 RCNY § 28-101(b), which shall be well maintained to ensure maximum noise reduction.

         vi. When the responsible party uses new modern hydraulic cranes as set forth in clause (ii) of this subparagraph and/or additional source controls set forth in clause (iii) of this subparagraph, between the hours of 7:00 a.m. to 6:00 p.m. on weekdays, the responsible party need not utilize additional pathway controls listed in subparagraph C of this paragraph, unless the responsible party is performing work within 35 feet of an indoor receptor and with the exception of any required perimeter barriers as specified in 15 RCNY § 28-101(g).

      C. NOISE PATHWAY CONTROLS: NOISE BARRIERS &amp; CURTAINS The responsible party shall utilize one of the following pathway controls.

The gaps between and/or under container boxes shall be filled-in with heavy vinyl noise curtains or similar material.

   2. Auger Drill Rigs. This rule shall provide mitigation strategies the responsible party shall utilize when using auger drill rigs. Auger drill rigs are typically mounted to cranes or they can be built as dedicated machines as well. Auger drill rigs are used to drill shafts into the ground, which are then filled with cement form concrete piles, to loosen underlying soil and allow solid piles to be driven more easily, or used in multiple configuration to "mix" grout into the soil and change the soil's properties (i.e. strengthen it and reduce its water content).

      A. GENERAL RULES OF OPERATION

         i. The hours of operation shall be in accordance with the rules set forth in 15 RCNY § 28-103.

      B. SOURCE CONTROLS: QUIETER MODELS &amp; SILENCERS

         i. The auger drill rig or crane shall be equipped with an effective muffler in accordance with 15 RCNY § 28-101(b), which shall be well- maintained to ensure maximum noise reduction.

         ii. All moving parts shall be well lubricated for proper drilling performance and to avoid unnecessary noise from squeaking parts.

         iii. Debris on the drill bit shall be removed without quick twisting, jerking or hammering the bit, unless geotechnical conditions at the location so require. Alternative quieter methods include use of a high pressure water hose where debris is not contaminated or a laborer using a hand shovel.

      C. PATHWAY CONTROLS: NOISE BARRIERS &amp; CURTAINS The responsible party shall utilize one of the following pathway controls. However, if the Department receives noise complaints concerning the site, the responsible party shall utilize additional pathway controls listed in this subparagraph as required by DEP.

         i. The responsible party shall construct a portable noise barrier that shall be free from gaps and holes and constructed of a sufficiently massive material to achieve a Sound Transmission Class rating of STC 30, or greater, and shall be positioned as close as possible to the auger drill rig. A portable (i.e. unanchored) noise barrier may be made, for example, of concrete jersey bases with 3/4-inch plywood panels attached to fence posts extending upwards to an overall height of 15 feet.

A properly balanced canted panel, not susceptible to windy conditions, may be placed on top of the barrier in order to provide better shielding for multi-story receptors. However, said barrier's height shall not exceed 15 feet including the balanced canted portion.

         ii. The noise barrier shall be long and tall enough to completely block the line of sight between the auger drill rig and any indoor receptor within 200 feet and that is a maximum of 20 feet above grade level, when work occurs. The barrier should be placed as close to the actual auger drill rig work as feasible. Greater noise attenuation occurs when barriers are placed as close as possible to the noise source.

         iii. Noise curtain material, such as SoundSeal model BBC-13-2, or equivalently rated material, shall be used to form a noise barrier in the direction of sensitive receptors and completely block the line of sight between the receptors and auger drill rig. Noise curtains are typically made out of a 1/4-inch thick heavy vinyl material, often with a noise absorptive quilt attached to one side. These noise curtains generally weigh 1.5 lbs/sq. ft., have an STC rating of about 32, and come in 4-foot wide sheets complete with grommets and Velcro edges to aid in hanging the curtains and sealing the sheets side-by-side.

         iv. Alternative barriers may be utilized in accordance with site-specific conditions. For example, shipping container (Conex) boxes or truck trailers may be positioned along the edge of the work site to form a semi-permanent noise barrier. Sufficient space at the site is necessary as these containers are generally 8 feet wide by 8 feet tall and can be double-stacked to form a noise barrier 16 feet in height. The gaps between and/or under container boxes shall be filled-in with heavy vinyl noise curtains or similar material.

   3. Street Plates. In addition to the Department of Transportation rules set forth in 34 RCNY § 2-11(10), the responsible party shall follow one or more of the following methods to reduce noise emissions from loose or rattling street plates.

      A. SOURCE CONTROLS:

         i. The street plates shall be installed in the street surface in accordance with 34 RCNY § 2-11(10) in order to have a level and smooth transition from pavement to plate surface and to keep the plates firmly in place.

         ii. Asphalt cold-patch shall be applied when feasible around the edges of the street plate to minimize vehicular tire impact on the plate and to help keep the plate in place.

      B. NOISE PATHWAY CONTROLS:

         i. Whenever feasible, traffic shall be routed around the street plates by placing traffic cones, barrels, and/or warning tape around the plated area.

   4. Backup Alarms. In accordance with 15 RCNY § 28-101(f), all existing vehicles that enter a work site shall be equipped with OSHA-approved, and OEM manufacturer-approved (if necessary), quieter backup alarms by January 1, 2008. All new vehicles that enter the work site shall be equipped with OSHA-approved quieter backup alarms by January 1, 2008. All on-road vehicles that do not enter the work site, but are in operation after hours pursuant to 15 RCNY § 28-103, shall also be equipped with OSHA-approved, and OEM manufacturer-approved (if necessary), quieter backup alarms by January 1, 2008. The work site referenced in this paragraph shall mean construction sites within the property line. Subparagraph A of this paragraph contains a list of quieter OSHA-approved backup alarms pursuant to OSHA Regulations, 29 C.F.R. Part 1926, Subpart "O", 1926.601.b.4 and 1926.602.a.9. If the responsible party cannot reasonably comply with the requirements of this paragraph, such person shall file an Alternative Noise Mitigation Plan in accordance with 15 RCNY § 28-104.

      A. SOURCE CONTROLS: QUIETER MAKES &amp; MODELS

         i. Quieter alarms or similar backup devices that meet OSHA requirements may be selected from the list below or from equivalent quieter alarms.

            (a) Examples of manually-adjustable backup alarms include:

               •     Preco Model 45AA

               •     Ecco Model 820

            (b) Examples of automatically-adjustable backup alarms include:

               •     Preco Model 1048

               •     Ecco Model SA907

               •     Grote Model 73100

            (c) Examples of community sensitive backup alarms include:

               •     BBS-TEK Brigade Model BBS-92

         ii. When the responsible party uses quieter backup alarms as described in clause (i) of this subparagraph, the responsible party need not utilize additional pathway controls listed in subparagraph B of this paragraph, unless the responsible party is performing work within 35 feet of an indoor receptor and with the exception of any required perimeter barriers as specified in 15 RCNY § 28-101(g).

      B. NOISE PATHWAY CONTROLS. If it is not feasible to select one of the OSHA-approved alarms in subparagraph A of this paragraph, responsible parties shall utilize one of the following pathway controls. However, if the Department receives noise complaints concerning the site, the responsible party shall utilize additional pathway controls listed in this subparagraph as required by DEP.

         i. Responsible parties shall attempt to reduce the necessity of backing-up by selecting a straight drive-through truck route.

         ii. The responsible party shall construct a portable noise barrier that shall be free from gaps and holes and constructed of a sufficiently massive material to achieve a Sound Transmission Class rating of STC 30 or greater. It shall be positioned as close as possible to the vehicle, in order to provide the greatest insertion loss. A portable (i.e. unanchored) noise barrier may be made, for example, of concrete jersey bases with 3/4-inch plywood panels attached to fence posts extending upwards to an overall height of 15 feet. This shall be the maximum height for a free-standing barrier in order to avoid it tipping over from wind load. Multiple jersey bases and plywood panels may be positioned adjacent to one another to form a barrier of any desired length. The gaps between adjacent panels shall be filled-in with noise curtain material, additional plywood, or similar material. A canted panel may also be built on top of the barrier in order to provide better shielding for multi-story receptors; however care must be taken to avoid having the barrier tip over from unbalanced loading. Further, said barrier's height shall not exceed 15 feet including the balanced canted portion.

         iii. The noise barrier shall be long and tall enough to completely block the line of sight between the backup alarm and any indoor receptor within 200 feet and that is a maximum of 20 feet above grade level, when work occurs. The barrier should be placed as close to the actual backup alarm as feasible. Greater noise attenuation occurs when barriers are placed as close as possible to the noise source.

         iv. Alternative barriers may be utilized in accordance with site specification. Conex containers are likely already available to the responsible party. For example, where sufficient work site space exists, container (Conex) boxes or truck trailers may be positioned along the edge of the work site to form a semi-permanent noise barrier. These containers are typically 8 feet wide by 8 feet tall and can be double-stacked to form a noise barrier 16 feet in height. The gaps between and/or under container boxes shall be filled-in with heavy vinyl noise curtains or similar material.

e. Manually Operated Equipment.

   1. Concrete Saws. This rule shall provide noise mitigation strategies that the responsible party shall utilize in order to reduce the noise emissions from concrete saws. Concrete saws are used on construction projects primarily for demolition purposes, but can also be used for opening access holes, cutting stress relief channels, and finishing off new construction.

      A. GENERAL RULES OF OPERATION

         i. The hours of operation shall be in accordance with the rules as set forth in 15 RCNY § 28-103.

      B. SOURCE CONTROLS: QUIETER MODELS

         i. Smaller saws shall be used, based on the power and cutting depth necessary to perform the job, as they tend to be quieter.

         ii. A quieter-type saw blade, including a grinding saw blade or one made of ceramic or special-tipped cutting teeth, shall be chosen whenever practicable.

      C. NOISE PATHWAY CONTROLS: NOISE BARRIERS &amp; ENCLOSURES. The responsible party shall utilize one of the following pathway controls. However, if the Department receives noise complaints concerning the site, the responsible party shall utilize additional pathway controls listed in this subparagraph as required by DEP.

         i. The responsible party shall construct a portable noise barrier that shall be free from gaps and holes and constructed of a sufficiently massive material to achieve a Sound Transmission Class rating of STC 30 or greater, and is positioned as close as possible to the saw. A portable (i.e. unanchored) noise barrier may be made, for example, of concrete jersey bases with 3/4-inch plywood panels attached to fence posts extending upwards to an overall height of 15 feet. This shall be the maximum height for a free-standing barrier in order to avoid it tipping over from wind load. Multiple jersey bases and plywood panels shall be positioned adjacent to one another to form a barrier of any desired length. The gaps between adjacent panels shall be filled-in with noise curtain material, additional plywood, or similar material. A properly balanced canted panel, not susceptible to windy conditions, may be placed on top of the barrier in order to provide better shielding for multi-story receptors. However, said barrier's height shall not exceed 15 feet including the balanced canted portion.

         ii. The noise barrier shall be long and tall enough to completely block the line of sight between the saw and any indoor receptor within 200 feet and that is a maximum of 20 feet above grade level, when work occurs. The barrier shall be placed as close to the actual saw work as feasible. Greater noise attenuation occurs when barriers are placed as close as possible to the noise source.

         iii. Portable noise enclosures made of steel frames wrapped with noise curtain material, such as SoundSeal model BBC-13-2, or equivalently rated material, shall be built to surround (top and 3 sides) the concrete saw and the operator. A well made enclosure, using curtain material with a Sound Transmission Class rating of STC 30 or greater, can generally provide a 5 dBA insertion loss providing there are no gaps in the enclosure. Noise tents may be reused at other sites with proper care and maintenance.

         iv. There shall be multiple tents for multiple concrete saws. For example, when two saws are being utilized and they cannot fit under the same noise tent, the responsible party shall provide an additional noise tent.

         v. The noise tent shall be moved as the concrete saw work progresses in order to maintain the tent's ability to block the line-of-sight between the saw and the receptors.

         vi. Emergency concrete sawing that occurs on any public right-of-way after normal working hours as set forth in 15 RCNY § 28-103, within 500 feet of any residential receptor, shall require noise tents with double-thick noise curtain material, or a noise tent augmented with a portable noise barrier to form a double layer of mitigation.

         vii. Where there are receptors surrounding the concrete saw work site on all sides, two tents shall be used whenever practicable, on either side of the saw, to form a complete enclosure.






*§ 28-103 Authorized Work Hours.* ::


a. Equipment shall be used only during the hours of 7:00 a.m. and 6:00 p.m. on weekdays, unless the responsible party obtains an after hours work authorization, in which case the equipment shall be used in accordance with the hours specified in the permit and in the after hours work authorization, as set forth in § 24-223 of the Administrative Code.

b. When work occurs after hours in accordance with § 24-223 of the Administrative Code, or falls within one of the exceptions to limits on after hours and weekend construction work set forth in § 24-222 of such Code, additional noise mitigation measures and/or techniques shall be implemented when required by DEP.






*§ 28-104 Alternative Noise Mitigation Plan.* ::


When required by § 24-221 of the Administrative Code or this chapter, a complete and accurate Alternative Noise Mitigation Plan shall be filed with DEP in accordance with § 24-221 of such Code. If and when approved by DEP, such plan shall be conspicuously posted at the job site. When an Alternative Noise Mitigation Plan is required, no construction activities shall take place until said plan is filed with and approved by DEP. The Alternative Noise Mitigation Plan Form is available at: http://www.nyc.gov/dep or at DEP's Offices at:

New York City Department of Environmental Protection Bureau of Environmental Compliance, 9th Floor 59-17 Junction Blvd. Flushing, NY 11373






*§ 28-105 Utility Noise Mitigation Plan.* ::


Pursuant to § 24-219 of the Administrative Code, every authorized publicly franchised New York City utility company that provides gas, electric, steam and telecommunication services shall have conspicuously posted a complete and accurate Utility Noise Mitigation Plan at all sites where construction activities take place. Although the plan need not be filed with DEP, it shall be readily available for inspection should a complaint be filed or during a routine inspection. The Utility Noise Mitigation Plan Form is available at: http://www.nyc.gov/dep or at DEP's Offices at:

New York City Department of Environmental Protection Bureau of Environmental Compliance, 9th Floor 59-17 Junction Blvd. Flushing, NY 11373






*§ 28-106 Required Noise Mitigation Measures for Utilities.* ::


a. A utility company conducting construction activity shall self-certify in its Construction Noise Mitigation Plan that all construction tools and equipment have been maintained so that they operate at normal manufacturer's operating specifications, including at peak loading. Such self-certification shall be indicated on the Construction Noise Mitigation Plan form required by 15 RCNY § 28-100. Upon a DEP inspection of the work site, DEP shall use the noise level guidelines in the Federal Highway Administration Roadway Construction Noise Model User's Guide, Jan. 2006, page 3, located in the Appendix to this chapter, as a means of identifying equipment that may be the cause of a noise complaint. If an individual piece of equipment is identified by DEP as exceeding the level specified in such Guide located in the Appendix to this chapter, upon notification by DEP, the responsible party shall have the option of: (i) performing maintenance to demonstrate a good faith effort, notwithstanding the model year of the equipment, to mitigate the noise by a measurable level acceptable to the Department, (ii) replacing the equipment with equipment that complies with said level, or (iii) filing an Alternative Noise Mitigation Plan pursuant to 15 RCNY § 28-104, within five business days of said inspection. If the responsible party elects to perform maintenance pursuant to option (i), but cannot demonstrate within five business days a reduction in noise by a measurable level acceptable to the Department, such party shall pursue one of the other two options to the satisfaction of the Department. The failure to exercise and complete one of such three options within five business days of said inspection shall be a violation of this rule.

b. All tools and equipment being operated on site must be equipped with the appropriate manufacturer's noise reduction device. These devices, including but not limited to portable compressors and other such pneumatic tools, such as jackhammers/pavement breakers, shall be equipped with a standard muffler and jacket, free from air or exhaust leaks.

c. Specialized vehicles, including but not limited to compressor trucks, vacuum excavators, pavement-coring, power-roding, flush trucks, and other vehicles with internal combustion motors, shall require additional noise mitigation measures as specified by DEP, such as the use of noise-insulating material that does not interfere with the engine operation and/or other techniques to reduce noise.

d. Portable compressors, generators, pumps and other such devices shall be covered with noise-insulating fabric, which is not to interfere with engine operations, and/or shall employ other techniques to reduce noise.

e. The time of day that work is in progress shall also determine the technology that provides the appropriate noise mitigation. All work that occurs after the hours of 7:00 a.m. to 6:00 p.m. on weekdays shall require an after hours work authorization in accordance with § 24-223 of the Administrative Code. From the hours of 6:00 p.m. to 10:00 p.m. on weekdays, the utility shall use daytime noise mitigation controls. However, work between the hours of 10:00 p.m. and 7:00 a.m. on weekdays and between 7:00 p.m. and 7:00 a.m. on weekends may be required by DEP to employ additional techniques, including noise blankets and barriers to reduce the level of noise for receptors within 200 feet.

f. Quieter jackhammers, compressors, and other such construction devices shall be used when available and/or may be required by DEP. A program shall be initiated between DEP and the utilities to perform additional noise-testing of construction devices and to make recommendations to DEP for future rules and use of devices.

g. All unnecessary vehicle engine-idling on site shall be prevented in accordance with § 24-163 of the Administrative Code.

h. All steel traffic plates are to be properly installed and secured to the roadway surface in compliance with 34 RCNY § 2-11(10)(e). Within 24 hours after a call to the utility from DEP, plates shall be re-set and secured properly.

i. Notification shall be given to residents within 200 feet of the construction when work is scheduled for longer than 3 days. Such notification shall include information on construction work schedules and locations.

j. The permit-holder shall respond to all noise complaints and/or official notice from DEP the same day as received or the next day if received after regular utility work hours or as may be required by DEP.

k. All new vehicles will be phased in with the installation of quieter backup warning devices in accordance with paragraph 4 of subdivision d of 15 RCNY § 28-102.

l. A formal noise mitigation training program shall be established and implemented for all field-worker supervisory personnel including sub-contractor supervisors. Supervisory personnel shall field-train all field workers in an effort to minimize construction noise.

m. When work is planned near sensitive receptors, including but not limited to schools, hospitals, places of worship, homes for the aging, etc., the permit-holder shall cooperate with the facility owner/operator to coordinate the work whenever possible so as to minimize the impact on the facility and the utility shall use quieter devices and other noise mitigation methods, such as blankets and barriers.

n. A DEP Inspector may visit the site to examine the Utility Noise Mitigation Plan upon receiving a complaint and may require further action to reduce the level of noise. The responsible party will be provided a 24-hour cure period to correct the condition or to file an Alternative Noise Mitigation Plan under 15 RCNY § 28-104. If the condition is not corrected after 24 hours or if an Alternative Noise Mitigation Plan is not filed with DEP, a Notice of Violation shall be issued. However, there shall be no 24-hour cure period with respect to compliance with 15 RCNY §§ 28-100, 28-101(a), (b), (f), or (h), 28-104, 28-105, and 28-106(a), (b), (d), (g), or (i).

o. Perimeter noise barriers shall be used as set forth in 15 RCNY § 28-101(g). All gaps and spaces in the semi-permanent or temporary barriers shall be filled with noise attenuation material, and such barriers shall be placed as close as possible to the noise source to promote greater noise attenuation.

p. Utilities that engage in non-emergency, long-term projects, defined as continuous work that cannot be completed within 15 calendar days when there is a dedicated lane, shall be required to comply with 15 RCNY §§ 28-100 to 28-104. Work shall be considered continuous even though there may be a cessation of activities for 24 hours or less during the project.






*§ 28-107 Perimeter Noise Barriers.* ::


a. Perimeter Noise Barriers - Noise barriers, positioned between construction equipment and receptors, must be used for all construction projects. Such barriers may be semi-permanent given the time and space requirements of the job site. They may be made of wood, plastic, Plexiglas, precast concrete or steel panels, or where work site space permits, natural materials, such as dirt piles or earthen berms.

b. Noise barriers shall be used to reduce noise affecting pedestrians. Being relatively tall and solid, noise barriers form an excellent perimeter and/or security fence around a job site in addition to reducing noise at street level. Greater noise attenuation occurs when barriers are placed as close as possible to the noise source.

c. When the work site is within 200 feet of a residential receptor, the responsible party that is required to use a work site perimeter noise barrier (or "construction fence") under DOB rules and regulations shall ensure that noise-resistant material fully lines the interior face (facing the work site) of the perimeter barrier, and shall ensure that:

   1. the barrier breaks the line-of-sight between the noise source and indoor receptors within 200 feet and a maximum of 20 feet above grade level where practicable; however, said barrier's height shall not exceed 15 feet, including the balanced canted portion;

   2. the barrier is made of a material sufficiently resistant to noise in accordance with subdivision e of this section; and

   3. there are no leaks or gaps that will allow noise to pass through the barrier.

d. Noise Barrier Design Options.

   1. Semi-permanent noise barriers are barriers that, due to their height, will require some form of anchoring system. Typically, semi-permanent barriers are intended for long term continuous use. Thus they are built out of materials suitable to withstand weather conditions for several years. Materials such as tongue and groove wooden timbers, vertical I-beam posts and lagging, or precast concrete panels, serve very well as semi-permanent noise barriers. Being anchored, semi-permanent barriers can easily extend to heights of 15 feet and must be in accordance with DOB and FDNY rules and regulations.

   2. Where practicable, the responsible party shall build a pitched panel on top of the barrier in order to provide better shielding for multi-story receptor buildings, however care must be taken to avoid having the barrier tip over from unbalanced loading.

   3. Alternative barriers may be utilized in accordance with site-specific conditions. For example, shipping container (Conex) boxes are likely already available to the responsible party. For example, where work site space permits, these container boxes or truck trailers may be positioned along the edge of the work site to form a semi-permanent noise barrier. These containers are typically 8 feet wide by 8 feet tall and can be double-stacked to form a noise barrier 16 feet in height. The gaps between and/or under container boxes shall be filled-in to avoid having noise flank around or under the container boxes.

   4. There are also several product vendors that design and manufacture noise barrier materials and barrier systems. These special purpose products are available in various colors and materials including wood, plastic, Plexiglas, precast concrete or steel panels. They are available with or without anchoring systems, as needed.

e. Noise Barrier Specifications. Noise barriers shall be made of noise-resistant material sufficient to achieve a Sound Transmission Class (STC) rating of STC 30 or greater, based on sound transmission loss data taken according to ASTM Test Method E90. Such a barrier can provide as much as a 10 dBA insertion loss providing it is positioned as close as possible to the noise source or to the receptors. To be at all effective, the barrier must be long and tall enough to completely block the line-of-sight between the noise source and the receptors. The gaps between adjacent panels must be filled-in to avoid having noise penetrate directly through the barrier.








*§ 28-108 Temporary or Portable Noise Barriers.* ::


a. Where there is a dedicated lane for such barrier, temporary or portable (i.e. unanchored) noise barriers shall be used for street work lasting longer than 15 days as set forth in this section. All such barriers shall be placed as close as possible to the noise source in order to maximize noise attenuation.

b. Where construction projects are of shorter duration than 15 days and within the property line and do not require perimeter barriers and are within 75 feet of a residential receptor, a temporary or portable (i.e. unanchored) noise barrier shall be made in accordance with this section.

c. Construction of temporary barrier. Noise barriers shall be made of noise-resistant material sufficient to achieve a Sound Transmission Class (STC) rating of STC 30 or greater, based on sound transmission loss data taken according to ASTM Test Method E90. Such a barrier may provide as much as a 10 dBA insertion loss, provided it is positioned as close as possible to the noise source or to the receptors. To be at all effective, the barrier must be long and tall enough to completely block the line-of-sight between the noise source and the receptors. The gaps between adjacent panels must be filled-in to avoid having noise penetrate directly through the barrier.

   i. Temporary or portable noise barriers, where required, may be made, for example, of concrete jersey bases with 3/4-inch plywood panels attached to fence posts extending upwards to an overall height of 15 feet and must be in accordance with DOB and FDNY rules and regulations. This shall be the maximum height for a free-standing barrier in order to avoid it tipping over from wind load. Multiple jersey bases and plywood panels may be positioned adjacent to one another to form a barrier of any desired length. The gaps between adjacent sections shall be filled-in to form a continuous solid barrier surface.

   ii. Wherever practicable, a pitched panel shall be built on top of the barrier in order to provide better shielding for multi-story receptor buildings; however care must be taken to avoid having the barrier tip over from unbalanced loading. Further, the barrier shall not exceed 15 feet in height including the pitched panel.

d. Noise curtains. Noise curtain material may be mounted or hung over perimeter chain link fences, or draped over small noise sources, to form a flexible noise barrier. The chain link fences can also be attached to the top of jersey bases.

   i. Noise curtains shall be made of a 1/4-inch thick heavy vinyl material, with a noise absorptive quilt attached to one side (the side facing the noise source).

   ii. Noise control curtains shall have a Sound Transmission Class (STC) rating of STC 30 or greater, based on sound transmission loss data according to ASTM Test Method E90. The noise absorptive face of the curtains shall have a Noise Reduction Coefficient (NRC) rating of 0.85 or greater, based on sound absorption coefficient data taken according to ASTM Test Method C423.

   iii. Noise curtains of this sort, such as SoundSeal model BBC-13-2, or equivalently rated material, generally weigh about 1.5 lbs/sq. ft. They come in 4-foot wide sheets complete with grommets and Velcro edges to aid in hanging the curtains and sealing the sheets side-by-side.

e. Noise Tents. A noise tent may be used within the property line.

   i. Noise curtain material may be attached to a metal frame to form a portable enclosure (known as a "noise tent"). The noise tent shall have noise curtain material attached on three sides and on top of the frame, with the remaining side of the frame left open for work access and ventilation.

   ii. A frame size of 8 feet tall by 6 feet wide by 6 feet deep shall allow the tent to be positioned over small noise sources, such as pumps, generators or compressors. The tent may also be used to cover a laborer using hand-held power tools, such as jackhammers, saws or grinders. Caster wheels may be placed under the frame for mobility, or the tent may be picked up and moved with the arm of a backhoe, for example.

Chapter 49: Spraying Insulating Material
--------------------------------------------------



*§ 49-01 Definitions.* ::


For the purposes of this chapter, the following term has the following meaning:

Insulating Material. “Insulating Material” means any material or combination of materials, except spray on foam, that restricts the flow of heat energy.








*§ 49-02 Applicability.* ::


This chapter is not applicable to new construction.








*§ 49-03 Precautions to be Taken During Spraying of Insulating Material.* ::


No person may cause or permit the spraying of any insulating material in or upon any building or other structure during its construction, alteration or repair, unless he or she complies with the following precautions.

(1) Before the start of spraying operations all floor areas must be shoveled clean. Before the application of insulating material commences, the floor of the areas must be cleared of all objects, material and equipment other than that employed in the application of the insulating material, or all objects, material, and equipment must be covered with plastic or other approved tarpaulins in a manner that prevents the subsequent dispersal of dust.

(2) The entire floor, or the part of the floor to be insulated, must be enclosed with plastic or other approved tarpaulins in a manner that prevents the escape of dust from the enclosure. All interior open areas, such as elevator shafts and stairwells must be enclosed in a manner that prevents the escape of dust from the working area. Stack effect of the shafts and stairwells must be considered in providing proper enclosures. An enclosure will be considered satisfactory only if visible insulating material cannot escape from the enclosure.

(3) Wet insulating material that has fallen to the floor must be shoveled and scraped to prevent dispersal of dried material. This material must be removed no later than the end of the working day. Shoveled and scraped material must be placed in a heavy plastic bag strong enough to resist tearing or breaking under normal handling conditions and clearly marked as containing insulating material waste. The bags must then be placed into containers, pursuant to Section BC 3303.4.2 of the New York City Building Code. The contents of the aforementioned plastic bags must not be transferred to another container and must not be combined with any designated recyclable materials, pursuant to §§ 16-305, 16-306, 16-306.1, 16-307, 16-308 and 16-314 of the Administrative Code of the City of New York. The plastic bags must be placed upon a vehicle for either transfer to a solid waste transfer station, pursuant to 16 RCNY Ch. 4 or disposal at a site approved by the commissioner and regulated under 6 NYCRR Part 360 if located in New York State or that is consistent with the regulations adopted by any locality where such disposal site is located if outside New York State.

(4) All areas used for opening bags containing insulating material and/or changing of containers must be vacuumed with a HEPA air filtration vacuum or a dust collection system.

(5) Signs must be posted outside enclosures warning persons that entering the enclosure without appropriate apparel may be a hazard.

(6) Facilities must be provided and procedures instituted and supervised that prevent the removal and dispersal of insulating material from the construction site on the clothing or other accessories of persons leaving the area. All persons involved in the spraying of insulating material at the site must be furnished with personal protective equipment specified in the applicable Safety Data Sheet, including suitable coveralls which must be left at the site until properly disposed of in plastic garbage bags. No person will be permitted in an area in which spraying or handling of insulating material is underway or has taken place until the final vacuuming referred to in paragraph four of this subdivision has been accomplished, unless such person is furnished with or wears personal protective equipment in accordance with this paragraph.

(7) Any plenum or structures coated with insulating material which are intended for use in circulation of air in the building must be thoroughly cleaned of all debris, dust and waste insulation. All applied insulation material within a plenum or duct must comply with Section MC 602.2.1 of the New York City Mechanical Code.

(8) A person who is fully trained in accordance with current standard industry practice must be assigned the full-time responsibility of supervising the spraying, preparation and clean-up operations to ensure that no insulating material is released from the construction site.

(9) In case of emission of insulation material from the construction site, immediate steps must be taken to cease such emissions which may include work stoppage at the source of the emissions. There must then be immediate and complete clean-up of all material that has escaped the construction site using control measures including but not limited to the use of a water hose and HEPA vacuum that prevent further dispersal of any insulating material into the atmosphere.
