   (2) One-Year Ban. The Chairperson can deny an Application if, during the previous one year, the Applicant has committed:

      (ii) The traffic infraction of unlicensed operation of a motor vehicle.

   (2) The Chairperson will deny an Application for a renewal License if the Applicant has not completed all the requirements of an Application within 180 days after the expiration date of the prior License.

   (3) The Chairperson will not deny an Application under this Rule if completion is delayed because the Chairperson has not issued a final decision and the Applicant has complied with any requests made by the Chairperson.

(e) Additional Consideration of an Application.

(b) Critical Driver's Program. ("Points" in this Section refers to points assessed by the Department of Motor Vehicles). In addition to any other action the Commission might take, the following penalties will be enforced as part of the Commission's Critical Driver's Program:

   (1) License Suspension. If, within a 15-month period, a Driver accumulates six or more points but fewer than ten points on his or her driver's license (whether issued by New York or another state), the Commission will suspend the Driver's Paratransit Driver's License for 30 days.

   (2) License Revocation. If, within a 15-month period, a Driver accumulates 10 or more points on his or her driver's license (whether issued by New York or another state), the Commission will revoke the Driver's Paratransit Driver's License.

   (3) Review of Driver Fitness. The Commission can at any time review the fitness of a Driver to continue to be licensed following any moving violation, Collision, or other driving-related incident and can seek to impose other, additional, and/or more severe penalties or take any other action permitted under these Rules.

   (4) 15-Month Period. When determining whether a suspension or revocation is required based on the accumulation of points in a 15-month period, the Commission will calculate the 15-month period by counting backwards 15 months from the date of the most recent conviction for the violation carrying points that is cited in the summons issued under this section.

   (5) Date of Point Accumulation. For the purpose of this rule, points assigned by the Department of Motor Vehicles for any violation will be counted as of the date of conviction.

   (6) Multiple Points from a Single Incident. A Driver can be fined points against his or her license for multiple violations arising from a single incident. For the purpose of calculating points that might lead to a License suspension or revocation, if a Driver has accumulated points for multiple violations arising from a single incident, the Commission will count the single violation with the highest point total.

   (7) Point Reduction for Voluntary Course Completion.

      (i) Before suspending or revoking a Driver's License, the Commission will, for purposes of the Critical Driver's Program, deduct three points from the total points that appear on the Licensee's driving record maintained by the DMV, or equivalent licensing agency of the state which issued such license, of any Licensee who voluntarily attends and satisfactorily completes a Defensive Driving Course. Such point reduction will count only towards points accumulated by the Licensee as a result of the conviction for violations that occurred within 15 months prior to the date of the completion of the course; counting from the date of conviction. In order for the Defensive Driving Course to reduce the Licensee's Critical Driver Program points, the course must be satisfactorily completed prior to the adjudication of the Critical Driver summons. Completion of the Defensive Driving Course after the adjudication of a Critical Driver Program summons will reduce the Licensee's Critical Driver's Program points only after the Licensee completes his or her suspension. If the Licensee's driver's license was issued by a state other than New York, the Licensee must submit a recent driving abstract from the state of licensure.

      (ii) The Driver must furnish the Commission with proof when the course was taken and that the course was satisfactorily completed before the Commission will reduce the Driver's point total.

      (iii) If the Commission has already suspended or revoked the Driver's License, the point reduction will not change the Commission's decision.

      (iv) The Commission will not reduce the total points of any Driver more than once in any 18-month period.

(c) [Reserved.] Program for Persistent Violators.

*§ 57-13 Comply with Laws – Traffic Laws &amp; Miscellaneous.* ::


(a) Critical Driver's Program ("Points" in this Section refers to points assessed by the Department of Motor Vehicles). In addition to any other action the Commission might take, the following penalties will be enforced as part of the Commission's Critical Driver's Program:

   (1) License Suspension. If, within a 15-month period, a Driver accumulates six or more points but fewer than ten points on his or her driver's license (whether issued by New York or another state), the Commission will suspend the Driver's Commuter Van Driver's License for 30 days.

   (2) License Revocation. If, within a 15-month period, a Driver accumulates 10 or more points on his or her driver's license (whether issued by New York or another state), the Commission will revoke the Driver's Commuter Van Driver's License.

   (3) Review of Driver Fitness. The Commission can at any time review the fitness of a Driver to continue to be licensed following any moving violation, Collision, or other driving-related incident and can seek to impose other, additional, and/or more severe penalties or take any other action permitted under these Rules.

   (4) 15-Month Period. When determining whether a suspension or revocation is required based on the accumulation of points in a 15-month period, the Commission will count backwards 15 months from the date of the most recent conviction for the violation carrying points that is cited in the summons issued under this section.

   (5) Date of Point Accumulation. For the purpose of this rule, points assigned by the Department of Motor Vehicles for any violation will be counted as of the date of conviction.

   (6) Multiple Points from a Single Incident. A Driver can be fined points against his or her license for multiple violations arising from a single incident. For the purpose of calculating points that might lead to a License suspension or revocation, the Commission will count the single violation with the highest point total, if a Driver has accumulated points for multiple violations arising from a single incident.

   (7) Point Reduction for Voluntary Course Completion.

      (i) Before suspending or revoking a Driver's License, the Commission will, for purposes of the Critical Driver's Program, deduct three points from the total points that appear on the Licensee's driving record maintained by the DMV, or equivalent licensing agency of the state which issued such license, of any Licensee who voluntarily attends and satisfactorily completes a Defensive Driving Course. Such point reduction will count only towards points accumulated by the Licensee as a result of the conviction for violations that occurred within 15 months prior to the date of the completion of the course, counting from the date of conviction. In order for the Defensive Driving Course to reduce the Licensee's Critical Driver Program points, the course must be satisfactorily completed prior to the adjudication of the Critical Driver summons. Completion of the Defensive Driving Course after the adjudication of a Critical Driver Program summons will reduce the Licensee's Critical Driver's Program points only after the Licensee completes his or her suspension. If the Licensee's driver's license was issued by a state other than New York, the Licensee must submit a recent driving abstract from the state of licensure.

      (ii) The Driver must furnish the Commission with proof when the course was taken and that the course was satisfactorily completed before the Commission will reduce the Driver's point total.

      (iii) If the Commission has already suspended or revoked the Driver's License, the point reduction will not change the Commission's decision.

      (iv) The Commission will not reduce the total points of any Driver more than once in any 18-month period.

(b) [Reserved.]

(c) Compliance with Traffic Laws. A Commuter Van Driver must comply with all applicable traffic laws, rules and regulations. The Commission will impose fines and penalties in addition to any fines and penalties imposed by the underlying law as follows:
