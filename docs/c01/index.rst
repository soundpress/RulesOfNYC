===================================================

Chapter 1: Rules of Practice and Procedures New York City Board of Standards and Appeals
--------------------------------------------------



*§ 1-01 Purpose and Authority.* ::


The Board of Standards and Appeals (the "Board") derives its authority from the following primary sources: New York City Charter (the "Charter"), New York City Zoning Resolution ("ZR" or the "Zoning Resolution"), New York City Administrative Code, New York State General City Law ("GCL"), and New York State Multiple Dwelling Law ("MDL").

The following rules are intended to fulfill the Board's legal mandate by providing clear and concise notice to applicants and the public at large of (1) the rules and procedures governing the practices of the Board; (2) requirements for filing applications at and appearing before the Board; and (3) the Board's commitment to ensuring the independence of the Board, which is crucial to the fair exercise of its authority and discretion regarding zoning and land use in the City of New York. This Section provides a summary of the Board's authority.

*§ 1-11 Sessions of the Board.* ::


Public hearings of the Board will be held on Tuesdays at 10 A.M. for the SOC and the A calendars, and at 1:30 P.M. for the BZ calendar or on days and times to be scheduled by the Board as may be deemed necessary.

Where the stairway is required to extend to the roof, the enclosure shall be so built as to form a bulkhead. The enclosure shall be ventilated by a skylight in the roof with louvres or ventilators, or exterior windows with ventilating sections at the top floor. All openings in such partitions shall be provided with approved self-closing fire doors, except where such openings are in the exterior wall of the building. The bottom of the enclosure shall be of fireproof material at least four inches thick unless the partition extends to the cellar bottom. A horizontal exit, as defined in § 267 of the Labor Law, will be accepted as a compliance with this rule when both sides of the fire wall or walls are occupied on any factory floor by the same occupant.

   (2) Where there are occupancies on any story or part of a story involving the storage or use below the top story of the following materials and exceeding the amount specified, and there are more than 5 persons employed at manufacturing above such occupancy, the interior stairway serving as required means of egress shall be enclosed on that story with fire resisting material from floor to under side of floor above, including any exposed stair soffits, landings and passageways; openings shall be provided with approved self-closing fire doors.

(c) Duties of Foreman. The Foreman or Person in Charge shall direct, enforce and have full charge of the "Fire-Drill" in every factory on each floor. Each day before work is begun he shall see that extinguishers, fire hose, fire buckets, etc., are in readiness for use, exit doors are unlocked, aisles are free from obstruction, that stairways, halls, etc., are properly lighted, and shall remedy any dangerous condition found to exist. Immediately after work is commenced he shall check up the Fire Drill Organization list and note if the regularly assigned persons are present. If any are found to be absent, he shall assign other employees (if practicable) to perform their duties. He shall immediately notify new employees of the existence of the Fire Drill Organization and give them the necessary instructions as to the duties they are to perform, etc. He shall be familiar with the operation and location of the interior alarm signal box on his floor. He shall listen for the test signal each morning at the appointed hour and in the event of the test signal not being heard he shall communicate with the superintendent or other person in charge of the building and advise him of the fact. The (Floor Captain's) Foreman's orders are final as to the carrying out of the fire drill on his particular floor.

(d) Duties of Watchmen. The Watchmen shall see that all doors and windows are closed so as to prevent the spread of fire. The Watchmen shall be the only persons permitted to remain on the floor during the progress of a fire drill and do so at their own risk. For ordinary purposes only one watchman and a substitute shall be designated. In special cases, however, extra watchmen may be assigned by consent in writing from Fire Commissioner.

(e) Duties of Searchers. The Male and Female Searchers shall search all toilets, dressing rooms and emergency rooms used and frequented by their sex and all other portions of the floor and order all persons, except those authorized to remain, to leave the premises. They are to take care of and assist all persons who may faint or be disabled. Searchers shall leave the floor immediately after the last squad leaves.

(f) Duties of Street-Alarm-Box-Runner. The Street-Alarm-Box-Runner shall be familiar with the location of the nearest city fire alarm box and know how it is operated. In ordinary practice fire drills the Street-Alarm-Box-Runner shall report to the Foreman for orders, and if his services are not required he shall promptly file out of the premises with the other occupants. Only when a fire actually occurs on his floor, or when ordered to do so by the Foreman, shall the Street-Alarm-Box-Runner proceed to the street alarm box and send in the fire alarm.

(g) Duties of fire brigade. The fire brigade shall have full charge of the operation of all auxiliary fire fighting apparatus and shall endeavor to extinguish, or at least hold in check until the arrival of the fire department, any fire that may occur. When it is necessary for the fire brigade to respond to different floors in the building they shall not use the stairways or fire escapes while the occupants are escaping from the premises.

(h) Duties of Exit Guards. The Exit Guards shall station themselves at all exit doors leading to fire escapes, stairways and other means of escape immediately upon the sounding of the alarm. There shall be two guards for each exit, if practicable: one to stand in the hallway holding back the door and the other directly inside on the floor. They are to keep the exit doors open and direct the movements of the persons using these exits and prevent congestion. Exit Guards shall remain at their stations until all of the occupants of the building have passed their station, then close their doors and pass out of the building. Upon signal for the occupants to return, Exit Guards shall take their designated stations and remain there until all persons have returned to their respective floors.

(i) Duties of Squad Monitors. The Squad Monitors, as soon as the alarm is sounded, shall see that the employees under their charge quickly form into line, two abreast, and numbering not more than thirty to each squad. They shall see that all aisles and passageways are cleared of obstructions. Note: Chairs, stools, baskets, etc., should be pushed under or placed on top of work benches. Monitors shall proceed at the head of their respective squads to the exit assigned, and then march up or down the stairs or to other exits as directed by the Exit Guards. On reaching the sidewalk monitors shall keep their squads in order and lead them a reasonable distance from the building, so as not to cause congestion and interference with fire apparatus. When the proper signal is given they shall return to their respective floors at head of their squads. Monitors will at all times see that those under their charge conduct themselves in a respectable and orderly manner.

(j) Holding of drills. Fire drills shall be held at least once each month at varied hours of the day, and all of the occupants shall participate therein simultaneously. Such drills shall conduct all occupants to a place of safety. Where dual operation interior fire alarm systems are installed as permitted under 2 RCNY § 4-06(l) of the Interior Fire Alarm rules of the Board of Standards and Appeals, the fire drill conducted each month shall include all of the persons on the premises engaged at work for a factory, and drills shall be conducted at least twice each year in which all of the persons on the premises shall participate simultaneously.

(k) Duties of owner. It shall be the duty of the owner, lessee or tenant of the building or his authorized agent or their representatives to personally observe that the "Fire Drill" is held simultaneously on every floor of the building and the participation therein of every occupant of such building. Any fire drill in which all of the occupants do not participate shall not be considered as complying with the law, except as otherwise provided in these rules. The person or persons representing the owner, lessee or tenant who supervises the fire drill at the building shall submit to an examination by the Bureau of Fire Prevention as to their experience and general fitness for such duties, and shall be so certified in writing by the Fire Commissioner.

(l) Duties of engineer. It shall be the duty of the engineer, superintendent or other person in charge of a building having an interior fire alarm system to test such system daily immediately after the beginning of business, and to see that all apparatus operated by springs requiring winding are rewound after each alarm and kept in normal condition for operation. Whenever it is necessary to test the fire alarm system at any other time of the day, owing to repairs, etc., being made, the person in charge of building will first notify all Foremen of the several floors of the intended test and likewise notify them when the repairs, etc., are completed. This precaution is taken to prevent confusion and excitement, also misunderstanding of the alarm signals. It shall also be the duty of the person in charge of building to sound the interior alarm system at irregular intervals, but not less than once each calendar month, for the purpose of holding practice fire drills. He shall keep on the premises a record of such drills showing the date when held and the required time for all occupants to reach the street or a point of safety outside the building. The person in charge of building must immediately acquaint new tenants of the existence of the "Fire Drill" Organization and its purport.

(m) Registration. The name and address of every person, corporation or co-partnership, that will, under professional service, carry on the trade, business or calling of establishing, maintaining or supervising the "Fire Drill" shall be registered in the Fire Department, which Department shall, upon evidence of fitness, grant a certificate to that effect.

(o) Fire area. A fire area is any floor space enclosed on all sides by exterior walls or fire walls or a combination of both. In a non-fireproof building with mill or non-fireproof floors and roof, such wall shall be not less than 8 in. in thickness if of brick or stone, and not less than 6 in. if of reinforced concrete, and extending continuously from the lowest story to at least 3 ft. above the roof and be coped. In a fireproof building such wall or walls shall be of fireproof material not less than 6 in. in thickness, and shall extend from the fireproof floor to ceiling, or underside of fireproof roof. No opening shall exceed 66 in. in width, or 60 square feet in area, the center of every opening in such walls shall be at least 40 ft. from the center of every other opening therein at the same level. All openings shall be provided with approved automatic fire doors on each side of openings. The number of sprinklers in the average protected fire area shall be determined by the number of sprinklered stories in such section. In determining the required capacity of water supplies, the number of sprinklers in the average protected fire area need not include those located in low positions, such as under benches, low shelves, closets and platforms and between cars in car barns.

(p) Fire Department connection. All automatic sprinkler systems shall be provided with at least one two-way siamese connection on each street front of the building for connection to the fire department hose. Buildings fronting on only one street shall be provided with at least two siamese connections when the street frontage of building exceeds two hundred (200) feet. Where buildings have frontages on more than one street there shall be a fire department connection on each street front where frontage is not continuous but in all cases where more than one Fire Department connection is required they shall be located as the Fire Commissioner may direct and shall not be grouped. The siamese headers shall be of the same diameter as the largest riser or cross connection, but in no case less than 4 inches or more than 6 inches. All siamese hose connections hereinafter installed, except those on piers or warehouses intended for fire boat use, shall be three (3) inch, female connection. Siamese on piers, warehouses, etc., intended for fireboat use, except where the source of supply is from a direct connection to city main, shall be not less than 3 1/2-inch male connections with standard fire department threads. The siamese shall be placed at least eighteen (18) inches and not more than three (3) feet above the sidewalk, in a horizontal position accessible to the Fire Department. Each inlet shall be provided with a clapper valve machined to a true face. Each siamese connection shall be designated by raised letters at least one (1) inch in size, cast in the fitting in a clear and prominent manner and reading for the service designated, viz.: "Base. Spkr.," etc., as the case may be. If the entire building is sprinklered, the fitting shall be marked "Auto. Spkr." Siamese hose connections may project through a street wall not more than twelve (12) inches beyond the building line except that where there is an angle formed by the street wall and a check piece or the base of a column, pilaster or ornamental projection, they may be so located that no part extends more than fifteen (15) inches from either side of such angle in accordance with the provisions of the Building Code. In each Fire Department connection there shall be an approved straightway check valve installed in a horizontal position, the piping shall be arranged to drain between the check valve and the outside siamese coupling by either a ball drip having a one-half (1/2) inch pipe connection and one-half (1/2) inch orifice and a bronze ball of proper size, or by a three-quarter (3/4) inch drip connection arranged to drain to a sewer. All sprinkler siamese street risers, siamese wall collars and adjustable siamese caps shall be painted green.

(y) Special locations and variations. In special locations, such as over electric generating, power and transforming apparatus, over their controlling devices and switch-boards, where water from the fire extinguishing equipment would be detrimental, the sprinkler lines and heads may be omitted at the discretion of the administrative official having jurisdiction, and when in his judgment a slight variation of this subdivision (y) of spacing is desirable to effect a more efficient distribution of water for fire extinguishing purposes, the sprinkler lines and heads shall be spaced as he may direct.

(z) Sprinkler position. All sprinkler heads shall be located, wherever possible, in an upright position on top of the pipes, except that sprinkler heads on automatic wet pipe systems may be pendent on concealed piping and when construction or occupancy of a room or enclosure makes it preferable.

   (1) Where standard one-half (1/2) inch heads are installed sprinkler deflectors shall be parallel to ceilings, roofs or the incline of stairs, but when installed in the peak of a pitched roof they shall be horizontal. Distance of deflectors from ceilings of mill or other smooth construction, or bottom of joists of open joist construction, shall be not less than three (3) inches nor more than ten (10) inches. In fireproof buildings, the distance between deflectors and panel ceilings shall not exceed fifteen (15) inches.

   (2) Where Conran heads are installed, the top of head shall be located the same distance below joists or ceiling as specified for deflectors in paragraph (1) of this subdivision (2); except that when heads are located under pitched roofs of piers or similar structures, they shall in general be installed in the upright position (not normal to slope of roof) and three (3) feet vertically below the underside of roof. When the administrative official having jurisdiction deems a variation of this subdivision (z) advisable to obtain a more efficient distribution of water, the heads shall be located with respect to joists or ceiling, as he may direct.

(aa) Spray clearance. Not less than eighteen (18) inches effective clear space shall be left below the sprinkler heads, so that they may discharge an unbroken spray blanket from sprinkler to sprinkler and sides of room when in operation. Any stock piles, racks or other obstructions interfering with such action shall not be permitted. Sprinkler system piping shall not be used for the support of stock, clothing, etc.

(bb) Pipe sizes. The number of heads on a given size pipe in one fire area in any story shall not exceed the following:

   (1) For standard one-half (1/2) inch heads.

When it is desired to use pipe of larger size than eight (8) inches in diameter, special ruling will be required by the administrative official having jurisdiction as to the permissibility of its use and the number of heads that may be fed thereby. Where practicable, it is desirable to arrange the piping so that the number of heads on a branch line will not exceed eight. When the piping is arranged on the "gridiron" plan, the permissible number of heads may be doubled, provided the feed main is of the size indicated in the schedule for the total number of heads. Where feed mains supply branch lines of only two heads each, the conditions approach those of long single lines. Such feed mains shall usually be centrally supplied where there are over eight (8) or ten (10) branch lines. Branch lines up to fourteen (14) in number may be fed from end, provided a two and one-half (2 1/2) inch pipe does not supply more than sixteen (16) standard one-half (1/2) inch heads, in lieu of twenty (20). Buildings having slatted floors, or large unprotected floor openings without approved stops, shall be treated as one room with reference to the pipe sizes, and the feed main shall be of sufficient size to accommodate the number of heads called for. Larger pipe sizes than are allowed in the schedule for a given number of heads may be required wherever the construction or conditions introduce unusually long runs of feed mains or many angles. Buildings with blind attics with small, unprotected openings to floor below, may be piped from the system on the ceiling of floor below, provided pipe size schedule is not overloaded on sizes three (3) inches or under.

(cc) Feed mains. The size of feed mains shall not be less than the size of riser and shall be arranged to run as direct as possible from source of water supply to riser. Feed mains for stair or other towers without approved stops between floors, when piped on independent riser, shall be of sufficient size to accommodate the total number of sprinklers in such tower.

(dd) Risers. There shall be one or more separate risers in each building and in each section of the building divided by fire walls. Risers shall be arranged to provide "Center Central" or "Side Central" supply to feed main. Each riser shall be of sufficient size to supply all the heads on said riser in one story, according to the schedule of pipe sizes in 2 RCNY § 4-09(r). If the conditions warrant, special permission will be granted allowing the heads in a fire section of small area to be fed from the risers in another section, provided the total number of heads in such area does not exceed the following number per floor:

   (1) For standard one-half (1/2) inch heads, 48.

   (2) For Conran one (1) inch heads, 12.

   (3) For Conran one and one-quarter (1 1/4) inch heads, 8. Risers shall not be located close to windows, properly protected from mechanical injury and freezing and shall be properly supported on foundations and by floor plates, clamps, couplings or approved hangers.

(ee) Connections prohibited. No connections, such as for sill cocks, house service or hose outlets, shall be made with a sprinkler system riser or any part thereof except as provided for in 2 RCNY § 4-09(l).

(ff) Air lock adjustment. Where gravity and pressure tanks feed through a common discharge pipe or "dead riser" to the foot of a riser and an air lock is likely to develop the discharge pipe of the gravity tank shall connect with the discharge pipe, or "dead riser," forty (40) feet below the bottom of the pressure tank.

(gg) Pipes and fittings. All pipe shall be full-weight standard wrought iron or steel threaded pipe, well reamed and screwed up tight into fittings without reducing the waterway. Fittings shall be standard cast iron fittings, and shall be long turn pattern on feed mains and risers. Such fittings shall be designed and guaranteed for a working pressure of 150 pounds per square inch and must be capable of withstanding a hydrostatic test pressure of 750 pounds per square inch without failure. All pipe shall be secured to the ceiling, walls and other parts of the building with standard steel, wrought or malleable iron hangers. Extra heavy fittings shall be employed where the normal pressure in the pipe system exceeds one hundred and fifty (150) pounds per square inch, and shall be designed for a working pressure of 250 pounds per square inch and be capable of withstanding a hydrostatic test pressure of 1,250 pounds per square inch without failure. All underground pipe shall comply with the specifications for cast iron pipe of the American Water Works Association.

(hh) Protection of pipes and sprinklers. When exposed to moisture, sprinkler pipes and hangers shall be protected against corrosion whenever found necessary by thoroughly cleaning the pipe of all scale and grease and painting with a coat of red lead and linseed oil paint or other acceptable moisture resistive paint. When exposed to chemical fumes, the pipe and fittings shall be coated with graphite or other approved chemical resistive paint. Care shall be taken not to paint the sprinkler heads. Supply pipes of risers in low basements or low spaces under ground floors exposed to frost, shall be properly protected by a masonry or wood enclosure, properly heated, or filled with mineral wool, sawdust or tax mixed with granulated cork, extending below bottom of pipe and through the top flooring of ground floor, or the pipe shall be protected with three alternate layers of one-inch hair felt and building paper or by other approved method. When of wood, such enclosure shall be constructed double with a layer of tar paper between the two thicknesses of wood. Where risers, drains, heating pipes, etc., pass through cinder concrete floors or partitions, they shall be protected with a metal sleeve or be grouted with cement mortar. Wherever sprinklers are exposed to corrosion, the heads shall be protected with an approved hermetically sealed cover, or with an approved wax coating.

(ii) Drainage. All sprinkler pipe and fittings shall be so installed that they can be thoroughly drained, and where practicable, all piping shall be arranged to drain at the main drips. Drains or drip pipes shall be so arranged as not to expose any part of the sprinkler system to frost, and shall be so connected, either by check valves or other means, that they will not overflow domestic service or other connections to the same sewer or house drain, or if carried through the wall and exposed to the weather, they shall be fitted with hoods or down-turned elbows. Drains, pitched not less than one-quarter (1/4) inch in ten (10) feet, shall be installed: At the base of the main riser; At each alarm valve; At each dry-pipe valve; At each gravity tank; At each pressure tank; At each fire department connection; On each floor, if independent floor control valves are used; and At each supply main, when the water in the same cannot be removed through any of the above drains. Such drains shall be installed with controlling valves so that flowing tests may be made to determine if the water supplies or connections from yard mains to the inside of the building are in order without causing water damage or overflowing service connections to the same house drain. Any such drain shall be not less than two (2) inches in size except that drains at independent floor valves shall be not less than 1 inch in size where floor valves are not over 2 1/2 inches in size and 1 1/4 inches where floor valves are larger and connected to a main drain riser of not less than 1 1/2 inches in size. The drain at the main riser shall discharge into a cone or sight drain, or if carried through the wall and exposed to the weather, it shall be fitted with a hood or down-turned elbow. At an alarm valve at the top of a riser in a down-fed system a drain shall not be required. On automatic wet pipe systems, the horizontal branch pipes shall be pitched not less than one-quarter (1/4) inch in ten (10) feet to drain towards the sources of supply with drip valves at the low points. On automatic dry-pipe systems, branch pipes shall be pitched at least one-half (1/2) inch in ten (10) feet.

(jj) Test pipe. In all wet-pipe automatic sprinkler systems a test pipe of not less than 3/4 inch in diameter shall be connected directly with each system but shall be connected to a pipe of not less than 1 1/4 inches in diameter in upper story and arranged to discharge through a 1/2-inch brass outlet, preferably to a point where it can readily be seen. With long runs or many angles, size of test pipe should be increased to one (1) inch or larger. Controlling valve should be located at a sufficient distance from where the test pipe passes through the wall of the building so as to reduce to a minimum the chance of freezing of water in test pipe. In all dry-pipe automatic sprinkler systems a 3/4-inch inspector's test pipe shall be installed at the end of the most distant branch line and fitted with a 3/4-inch shut-off valve stopped with a brass plug.

(kk) Pressure gauges. A four and one-half (4 1/2) inch double-spring Bourdon pressure gauge shall be provided in all automatic sprinkler systems as follows: Above dry-pipe valves; Below dry-pipe valves; At the pressure tank; At the air compressor; Above the alarm valve; Below the alarm valve; and In the connections from city water supply. Provision may be made for taking the pressure both above and below the alarm valve and the dry-pipe valve with only one gauge at each valve. A gauge shall not be required at an alarm valve located at the top of a riser in a down-fed system. Gauge connections shall be taken from the supply main or riser and not from the two-inch drain or test pipe. Gauges shall be installed in a suitable place protected from freezing and be controlled by a valve with arrangements for draining. A plugged outlet, not less than one-quarter (1/4) inch in size, shall be located between each valve and gauge for purpose of installing the inspector's gauge.

(ll) Valves. 

   (1) All valves two (2) inches in diameter and under shall be of brass or bronze, or other approved non-corrodible material. Valves over two (2) inches in diameter shall be of brass, or bronze or iron body, brass mounted, or of other approved non-corrodible material. All sidewalk siamese inlet valves, caps and chains shall be of galvanized cast iron or other approved non-corrodible material. All gate valves shall be solid or double wedge disc, stuffing box pattern with hand wheel, outside screw and yoke, or other approved indicator pattern. All check valves shall be approved straightway regrinding pattern, so built that the clappers may be readily removed for repairs.

   (2) Water supply gate valves. The piping connecting each source of water supply with sprinkler system shall be provided with a gate valve of the outside screw and yoke type, sealed open and tagged to designate its purpose, so located as to control each source of water supply except that from Fire Department hose connections. All such gate valves shall be located within the building where easily visible and readily accessible and as close as possible to the supply inlet.

   (3) Water supply check valves. The piping connecting each source of water supply with the sprinkler system, including Fire Department connections, shall be provided with a check valve. On two-source systems, check valves shall have a gate valve on each side to permit repair of check without shutting off both supplies, except that where the two sources of supply consist of tanks located above the highest line of sprinklers, a gate valve need only be provided on the downstream side of each check valve .

   (4) Control valves. All automatic sprinkler systems shall be provided with a main control or shut-off valve arranged to be readily accessible as near the stairways or fire tower as possible and sealed in the open position; except that when the sprinkler system is fed from water supplies on the roof of the building, independent and readily accessible floor control valves, sealed in the open position, may be installed. When not more than ten (10) standard one-half (1/2) inch sprinkler heads or three (3) Conran heads in any automatic wet pipe system are exposed to cold and subject to freezing shut-off valves may be provided to discontinue the places which cannot be properly heated, shall be controlled by an automatic dry-pipe valve.

   (5) Dry-pipe valves. A dry-pipe valve shall be taken to mean a valve automatically controlling the water supply of the sprinkler system in such a manner that under normal conditions its piping system beyond the valve is maintained dry, but in the event of fire, the valve automatically releases the water into the sprinkler system, for fire extinguishing purposes. Dry-pipe valves shall, for the purpose of these rules, be classified as follows: Type A, in which the valve is actuated by the release of compressed air in the sprinkler piping system, due to the opening of a sprinkler head; and Type B, in which the valve is actuated by an approved trip under electric control of an approved automatic thermostatic fire alarm system. Dry-pipe valves shall be located as near as practicable to the sprinkler system in an enclosed and accessible place protected from mechanical injury and freezing.

(k) Reserve for standpipe. Gravity tanks, intermediate tanks and pressure tanks shall contain not less than 3,500 gallons of water at all times, reserved solely for standpipe firelines purposes. When a gravity tank is to be used for both standpipe and house supply, the connection for the latter shall be made through the side of the tank above the level of the required standpipe reserve. Standpipe and sprinkler supplies may not be taken from one tank. Mercantile or Industrial Buildings in Group under the same ownership and operation: One gravity tank of sufficient water capacity to supply the largest unit of a group of separate and distinct buildings operating under one ownership, and located at such elevation that the bottom of the tank will be at least 20 feet above the roof of the highest building of the group, will be accepted as an adequate tank supply for the entire standpipe equipment, provided a dead riser is carried down from the bottom of the tank to an underground header system having a Post Indicator control valve for each building unit, the P.I. Valves to be located as the Fire Commissioner may direct. All underground piping shall be extra heavy cast iron. When in his opinion, the area covered is excessive or the occupancy is such that an unusual fire hazard is introduced, the Fire Commissioner may require additional protection in the nature of additional tank or tanks located remote from any other standpipe tank, or additional water supply in the main gravity tank, or a fire pump and suction tank of size and capacity to be determined by the Fire Commissioner or the Board of Standards and Appeals, or a combination of any of the foregoing supplies.

(l) Standard source of supply. Gravity tank located so that the bottom of same will be not less than 20 feet above the roof level and of a capacity as stated elsewhere in these rules and direct connected to the standpipe equipment by pipes of the same diameter as that of the largest riser. Tanks may not be fed through the standpipe fireline, but shall be fed through a separate line at least 2 inches in diameter, discharging into the top of the tank above the overflow level through the side or through the bottom, that portion of the pipe within the tank to be of brass or bronze. An electric or steam pump of sufficient capacity to deliver 65 gallons of water per minute at the tank shall be provided, or if the pressure in the service line is sufficient and the plumbing is such that a minimum of 65 gallons of water per minute may be delivered to the tank, connection to the house water service main in the basement, cellar or lowest story may be used instead of pump. The sprinkler and standpipe tanks may be fed from a common source of supply, either a pump or a direct service main connection, when a ball (float) valve is provided for each tank. Floats shall be of copper.

   Overflow. An overflow of diameter at least as large as that of the fill line shall be provided for each standpipe tank. It may be run through the bottom of the tank, provided it is of brass or bronze and has no joint inside of the tank, otherwise it must be brought through the side of the tank, 3 inches below the top (of sides).

When the control box is installed on an alley face of a building, or in a similar place where the control box is subject to injury from passing vehicles, etc., the control box must be thoroughly protected. This may be done by having the control box recessed, marked by waterproof red paint ring and waterproof white paint ring on the wall, or, when such protection is not available, protected by heavy iron channels or angles secured to the wall by through bolts, expansion bolts, or toggle bolts.

(e) Control handles. Control handles shall be of standard construction, arranged to fit the control boxes so that they may be locked without difficulty, and cable connections shall be securely made in an approved manner, according to the design of the handle.

(f) Cable.

   (1) The connection between the valve and control handle shall be as direct as practicable, and shall consist of a single piece of standard phosphor bronze cable not less than 3/32 inch in diameter. No splices in the cable shall be permitted.

   (2) It is essential that cable connections to valve and handle be securely made according to the design in each case. The cable may be slightly annealed for making ends, and when cutting the cable, it should be taped and cut through the tape, or a small amount of solder applied where it is to be cut, so as to prevent frayed end.

(g) Conduit.

   (1) The control cable for the shut-off valve shall be run in galvanized wrought iron or steel pipe or other standard and approved conduit not less than 1/2 inch in pipe size. The pipe or conduit line must be water-tight and continuous from the casing enclosing the operating mechanism of the valve to the control box on outside of building. The cable shall not be exposed at any point in its length.

   (2) All ends of pipe or conduit, not only at valve and control box terminals, but in the run of the piping, shall be carefully reamed so as to remove burrs and fins caused by cutting-off tools, which would interfere with the movement of the cable in the run, or cut, or wear the cable. Unions should not be employed in making joints.

   (3) Pipe or conduit must be rigidly and permanently secured in position. Pipe straps and hangers of standard forms may be employed for this purpose. In every case supports must be provided at points sufficiently numerous to prevent sagging. Pipe straps (if used) must be of metal of sufficient thickness to insure a permanent fastening and must be thoroughly coated to prevent corrosion.

(h) Bends and offsets.

   (1) Bends of small radius or through much of an arc, introduce possibilities of binding of the cable or of an appreciable friction resisting the pull of the cable: therefore, approved roller fittings shall be required wherever the pipe or conduit is bent to a radius of less than 4 inches, or wherever the bend is through an arc exceeding 15 degrees except as outlined for offsets.

   (2) When connections to control boxes are made from below it is frequently necessary to make an offset in the conduit to avoid a water table or other part of a building wall. One offset of not more than 2 inches will be permitted for each installation at such points. The bends in the pipe forming the offsets must be carefully made to avoid cracking the enamel or galvanized coating or the flattening or cracking of the pipe or conduit. The amount of offset shall not exceed 2 inches and the length of the offset shall not be less than five times the amount of the offset. For example, a 2-inch offset must be at least 10 inches long. Single offsets only shall be permitted. Double offsets are not acceptable.

(i) Roller fittings. For turns in the conduit greater than those mentioned above, approved roller fittings shall be used. No roller fittings turning more than 90 degrees from a straight line shall be used.

(j) Automatic control. The fusible link which controls actuation of the valve in the event of direct heat, shall melt at not less than 225 degrees F. and shall be so arranged as to in no way interfere with the manual means of shutting off the gas which is controlled by the handle in box placed on the face of the building. Only approved fusible links shall be used. Automatic control shall in no way depend upon electric current for its operation.

(k) Production tests at factory. Valves must be tight under the following tests:

   (1) Valves shall be mounted in the position in which they are designed to operate. Normal city gas pressure or equivalent air pressure shall be applied to the inlet side and the valve shall completely shut off the gas or air when closed as in normal operation.

   (2) To determine whether the valve shuts off tightly under this test, a tube shall be connected with the outlet side of the valve and the outer end of the tube shall be immersed in water to a depth not exceeding one (1) inch, indicating leakage by bubbles rising through the water from the end of this tube.

   (3) Valves, after this test, shall be capable of shutting off ten (10) pounds air pressure applied to the inlet side; to determine whether the valve is tight, the test procedure shall be as indicated in the preceding test.

   (4) Valve bodies shall be strong enough to withstand, without leakage, one hundred (100) pounds pressure applied from either end with the other end closed. In this test the entire valve, including the stuffing box, shall be completely immersed in water, so that leakage will be indicated by bubbles rising through the water.

   (5) The fusible link connections of each valve shall be carefully tested to avoid prematurely operating the gas shut-off valve through vibration or concussion. The construction of the fusible link connections shall be so designed and made that the automatic feature will not operate through vibration or concussion.

   (6) The entire process of manufacture of the valves shall be subject to inspection and review and each valve shall be tested at the factory by a recognized laboratory or agency with facilities for making the test prescribed by the Board of Standards and Appeals, and each valve must bear satisfactory evidence that it has been so tested.

   (7) Manufacturers of gas shut-off valves must submit the name or names of said laboratories or agencies to the Fire Commissioner or the Tenement House Department Commissioner, in their respective jurisdictions, with satisfactory evidence of their ability and facilities to properly carry out said tests.

   (8) Valves and operating mechanism shall be so designed and constructed that they will withstand deteriorating effects or corrosion, as evidenced by operating tests.

(l) Installation and inspection tests. 

   (1) After shut-off valve is installed, it shall be set and operated to determine that proper closure is secured by operating the control handle. Particular care should be taken to observe that when operating the control handle, no part of the cable or of its attachment to the valve interferes in any way with the positive closure of the valve.

   (2) After the above test, all gas outlets in the building must be inspected to insure their being closed before the valve shall be set and the gas turned on. Valve and connections shall also be tested for leaks by applying a solution of soap and water to all parts, including connections to gas piping.

   (3) After the valve has been used to shut off gas, it shall be reset only by authorized corporations, firms or individuals, or by members of the Fire Department.

   (4) Operating and installation corporations, firms or individuals responsible for the installation of the gas shut-off valves shall permanently maintain properly equipped service stations in each of the boroughs where they install valves.

(m) Inspection. Gas shut-off valves and installations shall be inspected at least once a year by members of the Fire Department or the Tenement House Department, in their respective jurisdictions, or by corporations, firms or individuals authorized to install gas shut-off valves, as determined by the Fire Commissioner or the Tenement House Department Commissioner, in their respective jurisdictions.

      (vi) Where the glass veneer is permitted to extend below the level of the sidewalk surface, an expansion joint of one-quarter of an inch or more shall be provided between the outer face of the glass veneer and the edge of the sidewalk. Such expansion joint space shall be filled with a resilient caulking compound from the level of the sidewalk surface to a depth at least 3/4 of an inch below such level.

      (vii) Where glass veneer is applied at an elevation more than eight feet above the sidewalk surface, the mastic cement binding shall be supplemented by the use of metal clip angles of a design approved by the Board. Clips shall be located in each vertical or horizontal edge of each section of veneer and shall be secured through the backing directly into the wall behind by means of expansion bolts and in a manner satisfactory to the superintendent. Angle clips shall be two inches or more in length and shall be of at least No. 16 U.S. gauge, and shall be so designed as to furnish at least two-inch bearing support on each clip and shall hold the glass in a vertical plane independently of the mastic cement.

      (viii) All horizontal joints shall be cushoined with pads of adhesive asphaltic tape which shall extend from the rear surface of the glass to one-eighth of an inch or less from the front surface. Horizontal joints shall be buttered with joint cement over the full depth of the joint, including the surface of the cushion tape.

      (ix) Shelf angles of approved design shall be set at vertical intervals of 3 ft. or less, in all horizontal joints located 8 ft. or less above the sidewalk, except that, where there are show windows it shall be unnecessary to have shelf angles below the level of the tops of the show window bulkheads. Shelf angles shall be of a type approved by the board and shall be secured to the backing in a manner satisfactory to the superintendent.

      (x) Where glass veneer is confined between non-resilient materials at ends, expansion shall be provided for by means of an expansion joint at each end of one-quarter of an inch or more throughout the entire height of the veneer.

   (6) Clips required under § C26-549.0, subsection (g) shall be non-corroding and located in each vertical plane in horizontal edge of each section of veneer and shall be thoroughly secured through the backing by means of non-corroding toggle bolts or into the wall directly behind the glass veneer by means of non-corrodible expansion bolts at least 1 1/4" long.

   (7) Shelf angles required under § C26-549.0, sub-section (i) shall be of non-corroding metal of a type approved by the Board and shall be thoroughly secured through the backing by means of non-corroding toggle bolts or into the wall directly behind the glass veneer by means of non-corroding expansion bolts at least 1 1/4" long.

   (8) Glass veneer units shall be separated from each other and adjoining material by an expansion joint at least 1/32" wide. Between the bolts and the veneer units there shall be a clearance of 1/64". All expansion joints shall be filled with an approved waterproofing mastic compound.

   (9) Glass veneer material shall not be used any higher than 2 stories and not exceeding 35 ft. in height above the foundation of the structure.

   (10) Exposed edges of glass veneer shall be flashed with non-corrodible sheet metal and caulked with an approved waterproofing mastic compound.

   (11) All awning brackets shall be set so as to be free of contact with the glass veneer. Glass veneer above awning boxes shall be carried by a continuous steel angle attached to the wall by anchors.

   (12) Signs shall be hung clear of the glass veneering material.

(f) Glass blocks (§ C26-550.1j.). Veneer or ashlar: Glass blocks may be used as exterior wall veneer under the rules of the Board. Note: Investigation has shown that glass block is not used as a veneer material in building construction and when uses of glass block are developed as veneer, the Board will then consider including in these rules the safe provisions for use.

(g) Veneering units of a type unprovided for in these rules, may be used, provided they are approved by the Board and are used in accordance with the limitations of the approval.
