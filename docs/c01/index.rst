      (ii) Sidewalk sheds required (§ C26-557.0,1).

         (A) If a structure is to be erected to a height exceeding forty feet above the curb, or if the structure to be demolished is more than twenty-five feet in height above the curb, then if the horizontal distance from the structure to the inside edge of the sidewalk, or to the inside edge of a temporary sidewalk erected by permission of the local authority having jurisdiction, is equal to one-half or less of the height of the structure, a substantial sidewalk shed shall be constructed over the sidewalk or temporary sidewalk in front of the structure.

         (B) (a) Regardless of the horizontal distance from the structure to sidewalk or temporary sidewalk, sidewalk sheds of adequate dimensions shall be erected when building materials are being moved over the sidewalk by means of derrick, hoist or chute. The extent of such sidewalk sheds shall be as required by the superintendent.

            (b) Whenever any material or debris is moved or shifted by means of a derrick, hoist, chute or similar device over any sidewalk, passageway or walkway, which is not barred or closed to the workmen or to the public, a sidewalk shed shall be constructed over such sidewalk, passageway or walkway as provided for in 2 RCNY § 3-02(e)(16)(iii) "Design of Sidewalk Sheds."

      (iii) Design of sidewalk sheds (§ C26-557.0,2).

         (A) Sidewalk sheds, where required, shall extend the entire length of the sidewalk in front of the structure, except that where construction work or demolition work on a structure erected before January first, nineteen hundred thirty-eight, involves only a portion of the structure, the superintendent shall prescribe the extent of sidewalk shed protection required.

         (B) (a) Such sidewalk shed shall be capable of sustaining safely a minimum live load of one hundred fifty pounds per square foot, but if such sidewalk shed is used for overhead storage of material, it shall be capable of sustaining safely a minimum live load of three hundred pounds per square foot. The members of the sidewalk shed shall be so connected, and such adequate bracing, shall be provided as may be necessary to resist the displacement of members or the distortion of the framework. The deck of the shed shall be built tight and of ample width, and where deemed necessary by the superintendent, shall extend over the entire width of the sidewalk, except for clearances of two feet from the building line and one foot from the curb. Such shed may extend beyond the curb to such extent as may, on the recommendation of the superintendent, be approved by the local authority having jurisdiction. If posts supporting the deck of the shed are placed beyond the curb, such posts shall be protected from displacement.

            (b) Sidewalk sheds shall not be less than eight (8) feet in height in the clear.

      (iv) Protection of ends and sides of sidewalk sheds (§ C26-557.0,3).

         (A) The outer side and ends of the deck of the shed shall be provided with substantial railings and toe boards, except that, in connection with the demolition of a structure originally more than twenty-five feet in height, or in connection with the erection of a structure which is to exceed seventy-five feet in height, the outer side and ends of the deck of the shed shall be provided with a substantial vertical enclosure, at least forty-two inches high, of boards, laid close, or of galvanized wire screen at least No. 16 steel wire gauge, and of a mesh which will reject a ball five-eighths of an inch in diameter.

Whenever provisions are lacking for the permanent support of the sides of an excavation in accordance with the provisions of § C26-563.0, a person causing such excavation to be made shall build a retaining wall at his own expense and on his own land. Such retaining wall shall be carried to a height sufficient to retain the adjoining earth, shall be properly coped and shall be provided with a substantial guard rail or fence four feet high.

   (4) License to enter adjoining premises (§ C26-384.0c). For the purposes of 2 RCNY § 3-02(f)(2) and (3), any person causing an excavation to be made shall be afforded the license necessary to enter the adjoining premises. If such license is not afforded, the owner of the adjoining premises shall have the responsibility of providing temporary and permanent support of his premises at his own expense, and for that purpose such owner shall be afforded the license necessary to enter the premises where such excavation is to be made.

   (5) Excavations affecting adjoining structures.

      (i) Excavations more than ten feet deep (§ C26-385.0a). Whenever an excavation is carried to a depth of more than ten feet below the curb, the person who causes such excavation to be made shall, if afforded the license necessary to enter the adjoining premises, at all times and at his own expense, preserve and protect from injury any structure the safety of which may be affected by such part of the excavation as extends more than ten feet below the curb, and such person shall support the adjoining structure by proper foundations, whether or not such structure is more than ten feet below the curb. If the necessary license is not afforded to the person causing the excavation to be made, it shall be the duty of the owner who fails to afford such license to make the structure safe, and to support such structure by proper foundations, and such owner shall, if it is necessary for such purpose, be afforded the license necessary to enter the premises where such excavation is to be made.

      (ii) Excavations ten feet or less in depth (§ C26-385.0b). The owner of any structure the safety of which may be affected by an excavation, shall preserve and protect such structure from injury and shall support such structure by proper foundations, except as otherwise provided in 2 RCNY § 3-02(f)(5)(i) and shall, if it is necessary for such purpose, be afforded the license necessary to enter the premises where the excavation is to be made.

      (iii) Support of party walls (§ C26-385.0c). In case an adjoining party wall is intended to be used by the person who causes an excavation to be made, and such party wall is in good condition and sufficient for the uses of the existing and proposed buildings, such person shall, at his own expense, preserve such party wall from injury and support it by proper foundations, so that it shall be and remain practically as safe as it was before the excavation was commenced.

      (iv) Weather protection (§ C26-385.0d). Where permission has been given under this paragraph (5) to any person to enter any adjoining structure, such person shall provide for such adjoining structure adequate protection against any danger of injury due to the elements which may result from such entry.

   (6) Conduct of excavating operations. All excavation work in connection with the erection, repair, construction or alteration, of any building or structure shall be conducted in a thoroughly workmanlike and safe manner. All equipment used in connection with excavation work shall be inspected, erected and maintained in safe working condition, during the entire time of the excavation work as provided in 2 RCNY § 3-02(e)(1).

   (7) Structures unsafe at commencement of excavation or demolition (§ C26-386.0). If the person who causes an excavation to be made or an existing structure to be demolished has reason to believe an adjoining structure is unsafe, such person shall forthwith report his belief in writing to the superintendent, who shall cause an inspection of such premises to be made, and if such structure is found unsafe, he shall declare such structure unsafe and shall cause it to be repaired as provided in §§ C26-193.0 through C26-201.0.

   (8) Physical examination of adjoining property prior to and during excavation or demolition (§ C26-387.0). A license to enter upon adjoining property for the purpose of physical examination of such property, prior to the commencement and at reasonable periods, during the progress of the excavation or demolition, shall be afforded by the owner and tenants of such adjoining property to the persons causing such excavation or demolition to be made.

   (9) Protection at excavations (§ C26-389.0). Guards or fences shall be provided along the open sides of excavations, except that, in the discretion of the superintendent, such guards or fences may be omitted from any side or sides other than such as are adjacent to streets or public passageways. Suitable means of exit from excavations shall be provided. Railing, fence or solid enclosure shall not be less than forty-two (42) inches in height. Such portions of the railing as are adjacent to a public thoroughfare shall be provided with danger lights at night. From every excavation there shall be provided at all times ladders, stairways or ramps to provide for the safe access to, and egress from, such excavation. Such ladders, stairways or ramps shall be in compliance with the requirements of 2 RCNY § 3-02(j) relating to such means of access or egress and shall be installed in sufficient number and in such location as to be readily accessible. Such means of access or egress shall not be more than one hundred (100) feet from any point in the excavation.

   (10) Shoring, bracing and sheet-piling. The sides of every open excavation five (5) feet or more in depth where the earth is not sloped to the angle of repose of the material and where because of the composition of the soil, climatic conditions, depth of excavation or construction operations there may be produced an unsafe condition, shall be securely held by adequate timber bracing. Bracing for trenches shall be at least as provided in Table A and Table B.

The operations to be performed shall be in accordance with the pertinent provisions of these rules.

      (i) Demolition operations. 

   (1) Notice to demolish (§ C26-168.0). Before any structure or part of a structure is demolished, a statement in writing, on appropriate blanks to be furnished by the department, which shall constitute a notice to demolish, shall be submitted to the superintendent by the owner or any person authorized by the owner, giving the full name and residence of each of the owners of the structure to be demolished, the name and business address of the person who is to do the work and such other information respecting the structure as the superintendent may require. Such notice shall be submitted before the work of demolition is commenced and the superintendent shall issue a permit upon approval of such notice. Where a building is to be partly demolished, the provisions of § C26-161.0 shall be complied with.

   (2) Loading of structures during demolition. Precautions to be observed in the loading of structures during demolition shall be in accordance with 2 RCNY § 3-02(g)(2). Before any material is stored on any floor, the existing flooring adjacent to the bearing walls shall be removed and ends of floor beams in the bearing walls shall be carefully examined as to their condition and the amount of bearing on the bearing wall. If they are found to be in poor condition or with insufficient bearing, no material shall be deposited on the floor until these beams are shored from the cellar floor through each successive floor. No bearing partition shall be removed from any floor until the floor beams on the next floor above have been removed and lowered. All header beams and headers at stair openings and chimneys shall be carefully examined and if necessary shall be shored from the cellar floor through the successive floors.

   (3) Conduct of demolition operations. All demolition operations and equipment in connection with the construction, erection, repair, alteration or razing of any building or structure shall be conducted in a thoroughly workmanlike and safe manner as provided in 2 RCNY § 3-02(g)(4). Demolition shall proceed systematically floor by floor and all work on upper floors shall be completed before supporting members and stair and shaft enclosures below are disturbed. Work on an upper floor shall be considered completed when the steel has been exposed even if the steel has not been dismembered and removed. All enclosed stairs and enclosed shafts in a building under demolition shall be maintained enclosed on all floors except on the uppermost floor being demolished. Demolition of these enclosures shall proceed only on the uppermost floors and only when general demolition of the uppermost floor has been started. All hand rails and bannisters on stairs shall be left in place on each floor until actual demolition of the floor is in process.

   (4) Adjoining building protection.

      (i) Protection of adjacent structures. Structures unsafe at commencement of excavation or demolition shall comply with requirements of 2 RCNY § 3-02(f)(7) and (8). No further demolition shall be performed at that point until an approval to continue such work has been issued by the superintendent.

      (ii) Protection of party walls during demolition (§ C26-568.0).

         (A) Party walls. When a structure containing a party wall is being demolished, the owner of the demolished structure shall, at his own expense, bend over the anchors at the beam ends in the standing wall and shall brick in all open beam holes.

         (B) Party wall fire escape balconies. No party wall balcony fire exit shall be demolished or removed when such demolition or removal will destroy the full effectiveness of such party wall balconies as means of egress, unless and until the owner of the structure from which the party wall balcony is to be removed has erected or legally obligates himself to erect on the structure to be deprived of a required means of egress, a legal fire escape meeting the requirements of the superintendent. All beams in party walls shall be cut off close to the walls and stub ends removed without weakening masonry and beam pockets cleaned of loose mortar, and bricked up and bonded into the wall with sound brick and cement mortar. Tee anchors shall be provided on each sixth floor beam or sixth roof beam, except that the Borough Superintendent may require closer spacing of such anchors when required for the safety of these walls. Roofing material of adjoining buildings shall be bent over and flashed. All door or other openings in party walls shall be adequately sealed. Cornices where cut shall be properly sealed. Parapet and front and rear walls where disturbed shall be pointed up and made weather tight. All exposed furring, lath and plaster on party walls shall be removed. Roofs, skylights and flues of adjoining buildings shall be protected from damage from demolition by the demolition contractor provided he is granted the necessary license to enter the adjoining premises for that purpose.

   (5) Removal of gas, electric and water service.

      (i) All gas, electric, water, steam and other supply lines shall be shut off and capped as required by the appropriate City agencies, before starting demolition, except that where it is necessary to maintain any power, water, gas or electric lines during demolition, such lines shall be protected as required by the appropriate City agencies.

      (ii) Sewer connections to be sealed (§ C26-553.0). When a structure which has connections with a sewer is demolished, all sewer connections shall be sealed off in a manner satisfactory to the borough president.

   (6) Precautions before commencing demolition. Before demolition is started, the cellar and all floors shall be thoroughly cleared of all furniture and other combustible personal property and all fixtures and equipment which would cause voids in the fill removed. If the cellar is to be filled to grade, the existing cellar floor shall be broken up to provide ground drainage and prevent accumulation of water. If the cellar is not to be filled, adequate cellar drainage shall be provided.

   (7) Removal of glass. Before the commencement of the actual demolition, all glass in windows, doors, skylights and glazed windows and glass in furnishings shall be removed.

   (8) Boarding of windows and exterior wall openings. Every window or other opening in the exterior walls of any structure more than twenty-five (25) feet in height, unless such window or opening is so located as to preclude the possibility of injury to any person by material which may fall from such window or opening, shall be boarded up or otherwise substantially covered.

   (9) Access to floors. There shall be provided at all times, safe access to and egress from every building and every floor in every building in course of demolition by means of unobstructed hallways, stairways or ladder runs so enclosed or so located as to protect the persons using them from falling materials. Access to any floor, except the top or working floor, of any building in the course of demolition shall be closed off unless the floor above is intact and all vertical openings are enclosed by a tight enclosure of not less than two (2) inch planking.

   (10) Demolition of walls. Demolition shall proceed in an orderly manner and the work on the upper stories shall be completed before any of the supporting structural members on the lower stories are disturbed. Sections of masonry walls shall not be loosened or permitted to fall in such masses upon the floors of the building as to exceed the safe carrying capacity of such floors. No wall, chimney or other structural part shall be left in such condition that it may topple over due to wind, vibration or any other cause.

   (11) Mechanical method of demolition. The mechanical method of demolition, whereby the wrecking of a building or part thereof, is accomplished by smashing the walls or floors with a heavy weight suspended by a cable from a boom or hoist, or whereby the walls are collapsed by the use of a power shovel, tractor or other mechanical contrivance, shall be permitted only in accordance with the following requirements.

      (i) The building or structure or remaining portion thereof shall be not more than eighty (80) feet in height.

      (ii) The zone of demolition as applied to a specific demolition operation shall be that area determined by the Superintendent.

      (iii) Unless permitted by the Superintendent, such method shall not be used where any building occupied by one or more persons is located within the zone of demolition.

      (iv) Such method shall not be used where access may be had to any space within the zone of demolition by persons other than the workmen performing demolition operations.

      (v) Workmen performing demolition operations may enter buildings or spaces within the zone of demolition but such workmen, however, shall not be permitted on or within the structure being demolished nor shall such workmen, excepting the operating crew, be permitted within the zone of demolition while the mechanical device as above described is in actual operation.

      (vi) Fences constructed in compliance with 2 RCNY § 3-02(e)(16)(viii) shall be erected to prevent persons other than workmen from entering the zone as established by the Superintendent.

      (vii) The controls of mechanical devices used in such method of demolition shall be located and operated a safe and reasonable distance from the point of demolition.

      (viii) Where a swinging weight is used the supporting cables shall be of such length or shall be so restrained that it is not possible for the weight to swing against any structure other than the structure being demolished.

      (ix) The Superintendent may modify the requirements of this paragraph (11), if in his opinion circumstances of a specific operation warrant a modification and may impose greater restrictions and protective measures.

   (12) Demolition of structural steel and heavy timbers. Steel construction and heavy timber construction shall be demolished column length by column length and tier by tier. Every structural member which is being dismembered shall not be under any load other than its own weight and such member shall be chained or lashed in place to prevent any uncontrolled swinging or dropping. Large structural members shall not be thrown or dropped from the building. However, when permitted by the superintendent, such members shall be slowly and carefully lowered by hoists equipped with adequate brakes and nonreversing safety devices.

   (13) Demolition of floor arches. Before demolishing any floor arch, debris and other material shall be removed from the arch and from the surrounding floor area within a distance of twenty (20) feet from such arch. Planks not less than 2 × 9 in cross-section shall be laid close together with a span not more than 10 ft. for the workmen to stand on while breaking down floor arches between beams. Such planks shall be so located as to provide a safe support for the workmen should the arch between the beams collapse.

   (14) Removal of material. Debris, bricks and other material shall not be thrown from floors to the ground or thrown from upper floors to lower floors but shall be removed

      (i) by means of chutes constructed in compliance with 2 RCNY § 3-02(j)(27);

      (ii) by means of buckets or hoists; or

      (iii) through openings in the floors of the buildings in compliance with 2 RCNY § 3-02(i)(15) "Floor Openings." Large pieces of debris or structural members shall be slowly lowered to the ground or sidewalk bridges. The ground area to which material are lowered shall be barricaded and warning signs posted.

   (15) Floor openings. The aggregate area of openings in any floor of a building in the course of demolition shall not exceed twenty-five (25) per cent of the entire floor area of such floor. The person in charge of demolition operations shall provide sheet-piling, shoring, bracing or such other means as may be necessary to insure the stability of the walls and to prevent any wall from collapsing due to the pressure of the accumulated material. Every opening used for the removal of debris in every floor except the top or working floor, shall be provided with a tight enclosure from floor to floor, equivalent to that afforded by planking not less than two inches in thickness. As an alternative in building when not more than six stories in height, such openings may be protected by a tight temporary covering equivalent to that afforded by planks not less than two inches in thickness and laid close. Wherever such covering has been temporarily removed to permit debris removal floor openings shall be protected by standard guard rails or railings constructed in accordance with 2 RCNY § 3-02(j)(10) and (13). No person shall be permitted access to within a horizontal distance of twenty feet from any opening through which debris is being dropped. Such covering shall be promptly replaced in position upon the ceasing of such work at the end of each work day. Every opening not used for the removal of debris in any floor shall be solidly planked over. Openings in the top or working floor more than sixteen (16) inches in least dimension shall be protected on all sides, except the side at which debris is deposited, by a guard rail or railing, or the sides of the opening shall be roped off at a distance of not less than two (2) feet from the edge of the opening by not less than a one-half (1/2) inch diameter rope securely tied to provide a guard of a height equivalent to that provided by the railing. Wherever men are employed in any work on a wall and a floor opening on the working floor is located immediately below the point at which such men are working there shall be provided a tight flooring not less than five (5) feet in width immediately adjacent to such wall.

   (16) Demolition requiring scaffolds. Whenever workmen are engaged in the removal of any part of the building or structure, which part is more than twelve (12) feet above a floor, platform or the ground, there shall be provided for such workmen suitable scaffolds constructed in accordance with 2 RCNY § 3-02(j)(3) "Scaffolds" or life-lines and safety-belts, or life-nets in accordance with 2 RCNY § 3-02(e)(21) "Life-lines and Safety-belts or Life-nets".

   (17) Catch platforms (§ C26-559.0).

      (i) During the demolition of the exterior walls of a structure, originally more than seventy feet in height, catch platforms shall be erected along the street fronts and over public passageways. Such catch platforms shall be erected and maintained not more than three stories or 35 feet below the story from which the exterior walls are being removed until such demolition has progressed to within three stories of the ground level. They shall be constructed of planking laid close without openings between the planks or between the plank and the wall. The outside edge of the platforms shall be at least five feet horizontally from the wall of the structure and shall be higher than the inside edge. The supports shall consist of yellow pine or spruce outriggers three inches by twelve inches, placed on edge, and secured against turning, spaced not more than ten feet apart. Each outrigger shall have ample bearing on the structure and the inside end shall be adequately secured. The planking shall be at least two inches thick. Plank shall lap the supports at least one foot at each end or shall be secured to the supports to prevent displacement.

      (ii) A fence of galvanized wire netting of at least No. 18 steel wire gauge and with mesh which will reject a ball five-eighths of an inch in diameter or of one inch boards laid close shall be provided along the outer edge and ends of the catch platform. Such fence shall be supported by substantial posts not more than ten feet apart, shall be pitched outward at an angle approximately forty-five degrees from the horizontal and shall be at least forty-six inches high, measured along the slope of the fence above the planking of the catch platform with which the fencing shall make a tight connection.

      (iii) Catch platforms may be constructed of other materials and following other designs, if they provide strength and security from falling material equal to that provided by the details specified above, and are approved by the superintendent.

      (iv) It shall be unlawful to use catch platforms for the storage of materials.

   (18) Storage of material. Material shall not be stored on catch platforms, working platforms, floors or stairways of the building to be demolished, except that any one floor of a building may be used for the temporary storage of material when such floor is of such strength as to safely support the load to be super-imposed. Storage spaces shall not interfere with access to any stairway or passageway and suitable barricades shall be provided so as to prevent material from sliding or rebounding into any space used by the workmen or the public. All material shall be safely piled in such locations as will not interfere with any work nor present any hazard. Combustible debris and waste material from demolition shall not be allowed to accumulate in any area of the demolition site. Combustible material and combustible waste material in excess of 15 cu. yds. shall be removed daily before the close of the day's work.

   (19) Burning at site. No debris shall be burned at the site.

   (20) Fire Protection and Fire Extinguishers. In structures undergoing demolition which have existing standpipe systems, such system shall be maintained as dry standpipes. When demolition is started, the standpipe risers shall be capped above the outlet on the floor immediately below the floor being demolished so as to maintain the standpipe system on all lower floors for Fire Department use. Standpipe hose, nozzles and spanners are not required to be maintained and may be removed at any time. Siamese hose connections shall be kept free from obstruction and shall be marked by a metal sign reading, "Standpipe Siamese Connection" and by a red light at night. The standpipe system may be used for water supply necessary to demolition operations. In freezing weather such standpipe system shall be completely drained after use to prevent freezing. Existing standpipe system shall not be utilized to convey compressed air unless the standpipe system consists of two or more risers in which event one of the risers may be used to convey compressed air to any floor or portion of the premises upon application to and permission from the Fire Department. In structures undergoing demolition which have existing sprinkler systems with Siamese hose connections, such system shall be maintained as a non-automatic sprinkler system. When demolition starts, the sprinkler risers shall be capped immediately below the floor being demolished so as to maintain the sprinkler system on all lower floors for Fire Department use. Siamese hose connections shall be kept free from obstruction and shall be marked by a metal sign reading "Sprinkler Siamese Connection" and by a red light at night. At least one 40-gallon water cask with 4 buckets or one 2 1/2 gallon fire extinguisher shall be provided on each story for each 5,000 sq. ft. of floor area. In cold weather, extinguishers shall be of non-freezing type and water casks shall be provided with calcium chloride or other approved material to prevent freezing. In lieu of the water casks or extinguishers, a charged hose line may be provided on each floor. This hose line must be of sufficient length to reach all parts of the floor.

(j) Equipment. 

   (1) Responsibility of employees and other persons for protection of the public and workmen. Where men are working on a scaffold with other men engaged above, the scaffold shall have a tight overhead covering of planking not less than two (2) inches in thickness or other material equivalent in strength and suitability as a protection to the men working on the scaffold. Where the type of work involved would render it hazardous and in lieu thereof may permit the catch platform at a higher level. Runways or ladders shall be erected to platforms of scaffolds five (5) feet or more in height. Every scaffold platform ten (10) feet or more above the ground or a floor, except platforms covering the entire floor space of a room within a building or the platforms of needle beam scaffolds or platforms on which the men working thereon are provided with life-lines and safety-belts in compliance with 2 RCNY § 3-02(e)(21) "Life-lines and Safety-belts or Life-nets", shall be provided with a guard rail and a toeboard. The guard rail may be of wood not less than 2" × 3" in cross-section, or other material of equal strength, properly secured at intervals of not more than ten (10) feet. The guard rail shall be not less than thirty-four (34) inches above the platform of the scaffold and shall extend the entire length of the scaffold. A toeboard not less than 1" × 8" in cross-section shall be provided or the space between the guard rail and the platform may be enclosed with a wire screen composed of not less than No. 18 Steel Wire Gauge with a one-half (1/2) inch mesh.

   (2) Materials.

      (i) Sizes and stresses of materials used for protection of the public and workmen (§ C26-556.0).

         (A) The sizes mentioned in this subdivision (j) are minimum requirements, except that lumber sizes are nominal or commercial sizes before dressing. Where wood is specified in this subdivision (j), members of iron, steel or other material of equivalent strength, rigidity and suitability may be substituted.

         (B) Where sizes are not specifically mentioned in this subdivision (j), the equipment and safeguards when of a temporary nature and not subjected to serious shock may be designed using such stresses as may be approved by the superintendent, but at most thirty-three percent above the stresses provided in this section for similar material when used in permanent structures.

      (ii) Lumber and timber. All lumber and timber used for the construction of ladders, scaffolds, ramps, runways, railing and other safeguards, except where otherwise required in these rules shall be either Red, White or Sitka Spruce; Douglas Fir; Norway Pine; West Coast Hemlock or other woods equivalent in strength and suitability. All lumber and timber shall be sound and shall not contain defects such as ring shakes, large or loose knots or other defects which may materially impair the strength of the piece for the purpose for which it is to be used. Where sectional dimensions of lumber are given, lumber of different sectional dimensions may be used, if equivalent in strength and suitability. Except for the dimensions of material given in 2 RCNY § 3-02(j)(6) "Ladders", which are actual dimensions, all dimensions for lumber and timber in these rules are nominal or trade dimensions. All lumber and timber shall be fastened at the various joints with sufficient nails or bolts of a suitable size to produce a secure joint, capable of withstanding the required load to be superimposed on same. Refer to Table II, Size and Number of Nails.

   (3) Scaffolds.

      (i) Construction and maintenance of equipment and safeguards (§ C26-555.0). All devices or equipment which are used in connection with the performance of work and regulated by this subdivision (j), shall be constructed, installed and maintained in a substantial manner and so operated as to give proper protection to persons and shall not be removed, altered, weakened, or rendered inoperative so long as they are needed or in use, except as provided in § C26-553.0, unless so ordered by a person in responsible charge of the operation.

      (ii) Erection of scaffolds. Only skilled workmen shall be employed in the erection or dismantling of scaffolds. They shall work under the supervision of a competent superintendent or foreman who shall take such precautions as may be necessary to insure safety. Every scaffold damaged or weakened from any cause shall be immediately repaired and workmen shall not be permitted to use the scaffold until such repairs have been completed. No scaffold shall be altered or removed while it is in use. Precautions shall be taken so that no material shall be delivered or stored upon a scaffold to such an extent as to overload or subject the scaffold to loads which it is not capable of supporting. Barrels, boxes, piles of brick or stone or other unstable objects or material shall not be used for the support of scaffolds or the planking of scaffolds.

   (4) Wood scaffolds. All lumber used in the construction of scaffolds shall be of spruce, Douglas Fir, long-leaf yellow pine, Oregon pine or other species of equivalent strength and durability. The material shall be sound; straight grained; free from cross grain, shakes, large, loose or dead knots or other defects which may impair its strength or durability. All nails used in the construction of scaffolds, stages and supports shall be of ample size and length and used in sufficient quantities at each connection to fully develop the strength of each member in compliance with 2 RCNY § 3-02(j)(2)(ii) "Lumber and Timber." All nails shall be driven full length.

   (5) Pole scaffold requirements. Scaffold poles shall be plumb and shall foot on a foundation equivalent to that offered by planking not less than nine (9) inches in width and two (2) inches in thickness. The footing shall be secured against any lateral movement. Where poles are spliced with wood cleats, the squared end of the upper section shall rest upon the squared end of the lower section and the two ends shall be fastened rigidly together with not less than two (2) wood cleats each not less than three (3) feet in length. The cleats shall be placed at right angles to each other and shall overlap the abutting ends of the pole equally and the combined sectional area of the cleats shall be not less than fifty (50) percent of the cross sectional area of the pole. A put-log shall be located adjacent to each pole and shall be nailed or otherwise securely fastened to the pole or to the ledger on which it rests. Pole scaffolds shall be firmly and adequately braced in such a manner as to preclude swaying or swinging away from the building. Diagonal bracing shall be provided to prevent the poles from moving in a direction parallel with the wall. Diagonal bracing shall be so installed that every spliced section of every pole is connected with the adjacent poles. Planking shall be laid with the edges close together so that the platform will be tight with no spaces through which tools or fragments of material may fall, except that on interior scaffolds, the platforms of which cover the entire room area, there may be provided a two (2) inch space between planking for ventilation purposes. Where planks are butt end to end, parallel put-logs or bearers shall be provided not more than eight (8) inches apart so that one put-log or bearer will support the end of one plank and the other put-log or bearer, the end of the other plank. Where platform planks over-lap, the ends of both the upper and lower planks shall over-lap the put-log or bearer by at least six (6) inches. Planking shall project over the end put-log not less than six (6) inches but not more than eighteen (18) inches. Inclined platform planking shall be nailed at each bearing. When a new working level is desired, the old platform shall be left undisturbed until the new working level is framed. As the platform level is abandoned with the progress of the work, the bearers, put-logs and ledgers upon which the platform previously rested shall not be removed but shall be left in place to brace and stiffen the poles.

      (i) Single pole scaffolds. Before any wood scaffold more than eighty (80) feet in height is erected, plans showing the design and the sizes of all structural members of such scaffold shall be submitted to the borough superintendent for his approval. Every single pole scaffold shall be constructed with members of a size not less than that given in Table C, "Minimum Size and Maximum Spacing of Members of Single Pole Scaffolds."

      (ii) Blasting Operations.

         (A) No person other than one experienced in the use of explosives and duly authorized by the person in charge of the job shall fire shots. Blasting shall be done only by means of electric shot firing equipment.

         (B) At least three minutes before firing a blast, the blaster shall give warning thereof by directing competent workmen, holding a red flag, to be stationed at a safe and reasonable distance from the blast at each avenue of approach or points of danger. All persons shall be required to retire a safe distance and to remain at such distance until directed to return by the blaster or person firing the shot.

         (C) Blasting charges shall be tamped only by means of wooden tamping rods and explosives shall be placed, or set into place, by steady even pressure only. Strokes or blows with the tamping rod are prohibited and no tamping rod which is frayed or split shall be used. Immediately after loading and tamping a hole and before firing the blast, the rock to be blasted shall be covered on all exposed sides with a strong woven matting composed of rope not less than one and one-half (1 1/2) inches in diameter or of wire rope not less than one-half (1/2) inch in diameter, which woven matting shall be of such size and weight as to prevent any particles from being projected into the air by the blast. Such protection may be omitted, however, where a single drill hole is fired at one time and where the nearest road, street, sidewalk or other thoroughfare, or the nearest occupied building is more than one hundred (100) feet from the charge to be exploded.

         (D) Only men experienced in the use of explosives and duly authorized by the person in charge of the job, shall fire blasts.

         (E) No person shall be allowed to deepen holes which have previously contained explosives. After a blast is fired, no workman shall approach the side of the blast until a sufficient length of time has elapsed to permit falling material to drop and for the smoke, fumes and dust to be dissipated or blown away. Where a charge has failed to explode, no one shall approach the charge, except the person conducting the blasting. Explosives shall not be extracted from a hole which has once been charged; the tamping, only, may be withdrawn sufficiently to allow a mis-shot to be fired by the insertion of a fresh additional charge of primer. In case of a misfire the blasting leads shall be disconnected before any person is permitted to approach the charge.

         (F) When there is doubt that all shots have been fired, no one shall return to the working area within thirty minutes when electric delayed detonators are used, or within fifteen minutes when instantaneous electric detonators are used, and then only when so directed by the blaster.

(y) Special locations and variations. In special locations, such as over electric generating, power and transforming apparatus, over their controlling devices and switch-boards, where water from the fire extinguishing equipment would be detrimental, the sprinkler lines and heads may be omitted at the discretion of the administrative official having jurisdiction, and when in his judgment a slight variation of this subdivision (y) of spacing is desirable to effect a more efficient distribution of water for fire extinguishing purposes, the sprinkler lines and heads shall be spaced as he may direct.

(z) Sprinkler position. All sprinkler heads shall be located, wherever possible, in an upright position on top of the pipes, except that sprinkler heads on automatic wet pipe systems may be pendent on concealed piping and when construction or occupancy of a room or enclosure makes it preferable.

   (1) Where standard one-half (1/2) inch heads are installed sprinkler deflectors shall be parallel to ceilings, roofs or the incline of stairs, but when installed in the peak of a pitched roof they shall be horizontal. Distance of deflectors from ceilings of mill or other smooth construction, or bottom of joists of open joist construction, shall be not less than three (3) inches nor more than ten (10) inches. In fireproof buildings, the distance between deflectors and panel ceilings shall not exceed fifteen (15) inches.

   (2) Where Conran heads are installed, the top of head shall be located the same distance below joists or ceiling as specified for deflectors in paragraph (1) of this subdivision (2); except that when heads are located under pitched roofs of piers or similar structures, they shall in general be installed in the upright position (not normal to slope of roof) and three (3) feet vertically below the underside of roof. When the administrative official having jurisdiction deems a variation of this subdivision (z) advisable to obtain a more efficient distribution of water, the heads shall be located with respect to joists or ceiling, as he may direct.

(aa) Spray clearance. Not less than eighteen (18) inches effective clear space shall be left below the sprinkler heads, so that they may discharge an unbroken spray blanket from sprinkler to sprinkler and sides of room when in operation. Any stock piles, racks or other obstructions interfering with such action shall not be permitted. Sprinkler system piping shall not be used for the support of stock, clothing, etc.

(bb) Pipe sizes. The number of heads on a given size pipe in one fire area in any story shall not exceed the following:

When it is desired to use pipe of larger size than eight (8) inches in diameter, special ruling will be required by the administrative official having jurisdiction as to the permissibility of its use and the number of heads that may be fed thereby. Where practicable, it is desirable to arrange the piping so that the number of heads on a branch line will not exceed eight. When the piping is arranged on the "gridiron" plan, the permissible number of heads may be doubled, provided the feed main is of the size indicated in the schedule for the total number of heads. Where feed mains supply branch lines of only two heads each, the conditions approach those of long single lines. Such feed mains shall usually be centrally supplied where there are over eight (8) or ten (10) branch lines. Branch lines up to fourteen (14) in number may be fed from end, provided a two and one-half (2 1/2) inch pipe does not supply more than sixteen (16) standard one-half (1/2) inch heads, in lieu of twenty (20). Buildings having slatted floors, or large unprotected floor openings without approved stops, shall be treated as one room with reference to the pipe sizes, and the feed main shall be of sufficient size to accommodate the number of heads called for. Larger pipe sizes than are allowed in the schedule for a given number of heads may be required wherever the construction or conditions introduce unusually long runs of feed mains or many angles. Buildings with blind attics with small, unprotected openings to floor below, may be piped from the system on the ceiling of floor below, provided pipe size schedule is not overloaded on sizes three (3) inches or under.

(cc) Feed mains. The size of feed mains shall not be less than the size of riser and shall be arranged to run as direct as possible from source of water supply to riser. Feed mains for stair or other towers without approved stops between floors, when piped on independent riser, shall be of sufficient size to accommodate the total number of sprinklers in such tower.

(dd) Risers. There shall be one or more separate risers in each building and in each section of the building divided by fire walls. Risers shall be arranged to provide "Center Central" or "Side Central" supply to feed main. Each riser shall be of sufficient size to supply all the heads on said riser in one story, according to the schedule of pipe sizes in 2 RCNY § 10-02(r). If the conditions warrant, special permission will be granted allowing the heads in a fire section of small area to be fed from the risers in another section, provided the total number of heads in such area does not exceed the following number per floor:

   (1) For standard one-half (1/2) inch heads, 48.

   (2) For Conran one (1) inch heads, 12.

   (3) For Conran one and one-quarter (1 1/4) inch heads, 8. Risers shall not be located close to windows, properly protected from mechanical injury and freezing and shall be properly supported on foundations and by floor plates, clamps, couplings or approved hangers.

(ee) Connections prohibited. No connections, such as for sill cocks, house service or hose outlets, shall be made with a sprinkler system riser or any part thereof except as provided for in 2 RCNY § 10-02(l).

(ff) Air lock adjustment. Where gravity and pressure tanks feed through a common discharge pipe or "dead riser" to the foot of a riser and an air lock is likely to develop the discharge pipe of the gravity tank shall connect with the discharge pipe, or "dead riser," forty (40) feet below the bottom of the pressure tank.

(gg) Pipes and fittings. All pipe shall be full-weight standard wrought iron or steel threaded pipe, well reamed and screwed up tight into fittings without reducing the waterway. Fittings shall be standard cast iron fittings, and shall be long turn pattern on feed mains and risers. Such fittings shall be designed and guaranteed for a working pressure of 150 pounds per square inch and must be capable of withstanding a hydrostatic test pressure of 750 pounds per square inch without failure. All pipe shall be secured to the ceiling, walls and other parts of the building with standard steel, wrought or malleable iron hangers. Extra heavy fittings shall be employed where the normal pressure in the pipe system exceeds one hundred and fifty (150) pounds per square inch, and shall be designed for a working pressure of 250 pounds per square inch and be capable of withstanding a hydrostatic test pressure of 1,250 pounds per square inch without failure. All underground pipe shall comply with the specifications for cast iron pipe of the American Water Works Association.

(hh) Protection of pipes and sprinklers. When exposed to moisture, sprinkler pipes and hangers shall be protected against corrosion whenever found necessary by thoroughly cleaning the pipe of all scale and grease and painting with a coat of red lead and linseed oil paint or other acceptable moisture resistive paint. When exposed to chemical fumes, the pipe and fittings shall be coated with graphite or other approved chemical resistive paint. Care shall be taken not to paint the sprinkler heads. Supply pipes of risers in low basements or low spaces under ground floors exposed to frost, shall be properly protected by a masonry or wood enclosure, properly heated, or filled with mineral wool, sawdust or tax mixed with granulated cork, extending below bottom of pipe and through the top flooring of ground floor, or the pipe shall be protected with three alternate layers of one-inch hair felt and building paper or by other approved method. When of wood, such enclosure shall be constructed double with a layer of tar paper between the two thicknesses of wood. Where risers, drains, heating pipes, etc., pass through cinder concrete floors or partitions, they shall be protected with a metal sleeve or be grouted with cement mortar. Wherever sprinklers are exposed to corrosion, the heads shall be protected with an approved hermetically sealed cover, or with an approved wax coating.

(ii) Drainage. All sprinkler pipe and fittings shall be so installed that they can be thoroughly drained, and where practicable, all piping shall be arranged to drain at the main drips. Drains or drip pipes shall be so arranged as not to expose any part of the sprinkler system to frost, and shall be so connected, either by check valves or other means, that they will not overflow domestic service or other connections to the same sewer or house drain, or if carried through the wall and exposed to the weather, they shall be fitted with hoods or down-turned elbows. Drains, pitched not less than one-quarter (1/4) inch in ten (10) feet, shall be installed: At the base of the main riser; At each alarm valve; At each dry-pipe valve; At each gravity tank; At each pressure tank; At each fire department connection; On each floor, if independent floor control valves are used; and At each supply main, when the water in the same cannot be removed through any of the above drains. Such drains shall be installed with controlling valves so that flowing tests may be made to determine if the water supplies or connections from yard mains to the inside of the building are in order without causing water damage or overflowing service connections to the same house drain. Any such drain shall be not less than two (2) inches in size except that drains at independent floor valves shall be not less than 1 inch in size where floor valves are not over 2 1/2 inches in size and 1 1/4 inches where floor valves are larger and connected to a main drain riser of not less than 1 1/2 inches in size. The drain at the main riser shall discharge into a cone or sight drain, or if carried through the wall and exposed to the weather, it shall be fitted with a hood or down-turned elbow. At an alarm valve at the top of a riser in a down-fed system a drain shall not be required. On automatic wet pipe systems, the horizontal branch pipes shall be pitched not less than one-quarter (1/4) inch in ten (10) feet to drain towards the sources of supply with drip valves at the low points. On automatic dry-pipe systems, branch pipes shall be pitched at least one-half (1/2) inch in ten (10) feet.

(jj) Test pipe. In all wet-pipe automatic sprinkler systems a test pipe of not less than 3/4 inch in diameter shall be connected directly with each system but shall be connected to a pipe of not less than 1 1/4 inches in diameter in upper story and arranged to discharge through a 1/2-inch brass outlet, preferably to a point where it can readily be seen. With long runs or many angles, size of test pipe should be increased to one (1) inch or larger. Controlling valve should be located at a sufficient distance from where the test pipe passes through the wall of the building so as to reduce to a minimum the chance of freezing of water in test pipe. In all dry-pipe automatic sprinkler systems a 3/4-inch inspector's test pipe shall be installed at the end of the most distant branch line and fitted with a 3/4-inch shut-off valve stopped with a brass plug.

(kk) Pressure gauges. A four and one-half (4 1/2) inch double-spring Bourdon pressure gauge shall be provided in all automatic sprinkler systems as follows: Above dry-pipe valves; Below dry-pipe valves; At the pressure tank; At the air compressor; Above the alarm valve; Below the alarm valve; and In the connections from city water supply. Provision may be made for taking the pressure both above and below the alarm valve and the dry-pipe valve with only one gauge at each valve. A gauge shall not be required at an alarm valve located at the top of a riser in a down-fed system. Gauge connections shall be taken from the supply main or riser and not from the two-inch drain or test pipe. Gauges shall be installed in a suitable place protected from freezing and be controlled by a valve with arrangements for draining. A plugged outlet, not less than one-quarter (1/4) inch in size, shall be located between each valve and gauge for purpose of installing the inspector's gauge.

(ll) Valves. 

   (1) All valves two (2) inches in diameter and under shall be of brass or bronze, or other approved non-corrodible material. Valves over two (2) inches in diameter shall be of brass, or bronze or iron body, brass mounted, or of other approved non-corrodible material. All sidewalk siamese inlet valves, caps and chains shall be of galvanized cast iron or other approved non-corrodible material. All gate valves shall be solid or double wedge disc, stuffing box pattern with hand wheel, outside screw and yoke, or other approved indicator pattern. All check valves shall be approved straightway regrinding pattern, so built that the clappers may be readily removed for repairs.

   (2) Water supply gate valves. The piping connecting each source of water supply with sprinkler system shall be provided with a gate valve of the outside screw and yoke type, sealed open and tagged to designate its purpose, so located as to control each source of water supply except that from Fire Department hose connections. All such gate valves shall be located within the building where easily visible and readily accessible and as close as possible to the supply inlet.

   (3) Water supply check valves. The piping connecting each source of water supply with the sprinkler system, including Fire Department connections, shall be provided with a check valve. On two-source systems, check valves shall have a gate valve on each side to permit repair of check without shutting off both supplies, except that where the two sources of supply consist of tanks located above the highest line of sprinklers, a gate valve need only be provided on the downstream side of each check valve.

   (4) Control valves. All automatic sprinkler systems shall be provided with a main control or shut-off valve arranged to be readily accessible as near the stairways or fire tower as possible and sealed in the open position; except that when the sprinkler system is fed from water supplies on the roof of the building, independent and readily accessible floor control valves, sealed in the open position, may be installed. When not more than ten (10) standard one-half (1/2) inch sprinkler heads or three (3) Conran heads in any automatic wet pipe system are exposed to cold and subject to freezing shut-off valves may be provided to discontinue the places which cannot be properly heated, shall be controlled by an automatic dry-pipe valve.

   (5) Dry-pipe valves. A dry-pipe valve shall be taken to mean a valve automatically controlling the water supply of the sprinkler system in such a manner that under normal conditions its piping system beyond the valve is maintained dry, but in the event of fire, the valve automatically releases the water into the sprinkler system, for fire extinguishing purposes. Dry-pipe valves shall, for the purpose of these rules, be classified as follows: Type A, in which the valve is actuated by the release of compressed air in the sprinkler piping system, due to the opening of a sprinkler head; and Type B, in which the valve is actuated by an approved trip under electric control of an approved automatic thermostatic fire alarm system. Dry-pipe valves shall be located as near as practicable to the sprinkler system in an enclosed and accessible place protected from mechanical injury and freezing. Automatic wet-pipe sprinkler systems in which only twenty-five percent (25%) of the heads are required to be maintained dry for protection from freezing, shall have only such heads under dry-pipe valve control.

      (i) When "Type A" valve is installed, the air pressure in sprinkler systems under such dry-pipe valve control shall not exceed forty (40) pounds per square inch, nor be permitted to fall below twenty-five (25) pounds per square inch, nor shall it be less than one-sixth (1/6) of the water pressure in any case. The air compressor shall have a capacity of not less than eleven (11) cubic feet per minute and the air supply for the pump shall be taken, if possible, from a room containing dry air, or it shall be passed through a drying chamber containing calcium chloride, in order to avoid the introduction of moisture into the system. The air pressure on such dry-pipe systems shall be maintained throughout the year. Not more than the following number of heads shall be controlled by one "Type A" dry-pipe valve:

      (ii) For standard one-half (1/2) inch heads.....400

      (iii) For Conran one (1) inch heads.....100

      (iv) For Conran one and one-quarter (1 1/4) inch heads.....64

   Where equipped with an approved quick-opening device the following number of heads may be controlled by one "Type A" dry-pipe valve:

      (v) For Conran one (1) inch heads.....150

      (vii) For Conran one and one-quarter (1 1/4) inch heads.....96

      (viii) When "Type B" valve is installed the actuating alarm system shall be designed to operate at a temperature lower than that required to open the sprinkler heads, and all connections between the alarm system and the dry-pipe valve shall be adequately protected against injury of any kind. When required by the administrative official having jurisdiction, the dead end of every feed main in such dry-pipe system shall be provided with an air relief valve or vent, so constructed as to be normally open in order to permit the free escape of air from the system, but to close automatically against the escape of water. Not more than the following number of heads shall be controlled by one "Type B" dry-pipe valve:

      (ix) For standard one-half (1/2) inch heads.....600

      (x) For Conran one (1) inch heads.....150

      (xi) For Conran one and one-quarter (1 1/4) inch heads.....96

   (6) Alarm valve. All automatic wet pipe sprinkler systems shall be equipped with an alarm valve so constructed that a flow of water through a one-half (1/2) inch orifice will operate an electric or mechanical gong. When an electrically operated alarm is installed in connection with an alarm valve or dry pipe valve, the installation shall be made in conformity with the provision of 2 RCNY § 10-02(mm).

(mm) High and low water. Electric Alarm on Gravity and Pressure Tanks. All gravity tanks shall be equipped with a device to indicate when the water falls below or rises above the normal level in the tank, with an indicator and alarm located in the engineers' room near the pump. All gravity and pressure tanks shall be equipped with a high and low alarm as hereinafter specified. The high and low gravity and the high and low pressure electric alarm shall be so constructed and arranged that when the water falls below or rises above the normal level in the gravity tank, and when the pressure falls below or rises above the predetermined level in the pressure tank, an audible and visible signal will be given in either the pump room or engineer's room. The audible signaling device for high and low water and high and low pressure electric alarm shall consist of a vibrating gong of at least 3 inches in diameter of the enclosed type and arranged for conduit installation, the same to be operated automatically from an approved device indicating the level of water in the gravity tank and from the pressure gauge of pressure tank. The audible signaling device for the alarm and dry pipe valves shall consist of an enclosed type 6-inch vibrating gong arranged for conduit installation. A closed circuit annunciator shall be provided in connection with the alarm system. The high and low toll-tale electric connections shall be so constructed that it will not be affected by moisture and the parts shall be heavy and rugged. The float shall be of approved type. All wiring shall be installed in iron or steel conduits and the installation shall be in accordance with the provisions of Chapter 9 of the Code of Ordinances. Only approved closed circuit systems shall be installed. Control panels to operate the signaling equipment must be approved by the Board of Standards and Appeals. The control cabinet shall be located in the engineer's or pump room where it will be under the supervision of the person in charge of the sprinkler system. The following sources of energy may be employed and are given in their order of preference:

   (1) Public utility electric light and power systems.

   (2) Electric light or power system (public utility or isolated plant) supplemented by storage battery either controlled by an automatic throw-over device or floating on the line and protected by a reverse current circuit breaker.

   (3) Storage batteries in duplicate.

   (4) Primary batteries of the closed circuit type. When the system is connected to the 110 volt lighting service a suitable cut-out is to be provided and it shall be enclosed in a locked or sealed metal cabinet. The connection to the system shall be the first connection on the house side of and as near as practicable to the meter. When batteries are used to operate the system they shall be placed in an approved cabinet provided with a lock and key.

(nn) Heating of tanks. The water in all sprinkler tanks subject to freezing shall be protected by internally heating the water or enclosing the tank in a frost-proof house properly heated and lighted.

(oo) Concealed pipe systems. All pipe in concealed pipe systems shall be of standard full-weight wrought iron or steel, painted with two coats of protective paint, one before and one after installation. Such pipe as shall be installed in ducts or be encased in cement mortar shall be inspected prior to concealment. When installed in the concealed space between floor arches and ceiling, such pipe shall be supported by hangers and all pipe, fittings and hangers be protected with two coats of paint.

(pp) Preparation of building. Floor or wall openings and other structural defects which prevent the banking up of heated air and retard the automatic action of sprinkler heads shall be provided with the necessary curtain boards and draft stops to permit specific control of the fire by the local sprinklers. Curtain boards shall project at least three (3) inches below the lowest sprinkler.

(qq) Approval of sprinkler system. Before acceptance all automatic sprinkler systems, excluding the water supply tanks, shall be subjected after installation to a hydrostatic pressure test of at least one (1) hour's duration at not less than fifty (50) pounds per square inch in excess of that which will be normally carried and observed in the sprinkler system, such test pressure, however, to be not less than one hundred and fifty (150) pounds per square inch in any part of the system. All pressure tanks shall be tested after erection to a test pressure of one and one-half (1 1/2) times the working pressure. To prevent the possibility of serious water damage in case of a break, the pressure shall be maintained by a small pump, the main controlling gate being meanwhile kept shut. Brine or other corrosive chemicals shall not be used for testing systems. In automatic dry-pipe systems with "Type A" valve control, an air pressure of forty (40) pounds per square inch shall be pumped up, be held for twenty-four (24) hours, and all leaks stopped which allow a loss of pressure of over two (2) pounds per square inch for the twenty-four (24) hours. In the case of automatic dry-pipe systems with differential "Type A" valve, the valve shall be held off its seat during the test to prevent injuring the valve. Non-automatic systems shall be tested after installation at not less than fifty (50) pounds per square inch in excess of the pressure necessary to reach the highest line of sprinklers. All tests of installed systems shall be made by the contractor in the presence of the Fire Commissioner, or his authorized representative. No piping, devices nor any portion of a newly constructed sprinkler system shall be covered up or permanently concealed until tested by the Bureau of Fire Prevention and approved of in writing, except piping passing through floors, walls, partitions or beams for distances equal to the thickness of such floors, walls, partitions or beams.

(rr) Types of buildings. 

   (1) Non-fireproof business buildings. Automatic sprinklers required in non-fireproof business buildings under the provisions of Chapter 5, Article 4, Section 72, Subdivision L, Code of Ordinances, shall consist of at least a One Automatic Source System, except buildings used as freight depots, car barns, stables, garages, factories and grain elevators which sprinkler systems shall be supplied by any two of the automatic sources or one of the automatic sources and a fire pump as described in 2 RCNY § 10-02(l) and (m).

      (i) Classification of standpipe fireline equipment. For the purpose of these rules standpipe equipment shall be classified as:

   (1) Standard Wet System in which the pipes are of sizes as specified in § 581 of Chapter 5 of the Code of Ordinances, and in which the system is at all times filled with water from at least one standard source of supply.

   (2) Four-inch street connection system, in which the pipes are of sizes as specified in § 581 of Chapter 5 of the Code of Ordinances and the system is at all times filled with water from one or more 4-in. diameter direct connections to public water mains in the street.

   (3) Automatic dry systems, in which the pipes are of sizes as specified in § 581 of Chapter 5 of the Code of Ordinances, and are normally dry, the system being connected to a source of water supply controlled by an automatic dry pipe valve as defined elsewhere in these rules.

   (4) Modified systems, in which the piping is 2 1/2 inches in diameter and supplied from a street main through a tap of at least 2 in. in diameter, as per General Resolution 179-20-S of the Board of Standards and Appeals.

   (5) Pressure tank system, which will be similar to a standard wet system except that primary supply of water shall be obtained from a pressure tank as defined elsewhere in these rules.

(j) Tanks above roof. Construction shall be as per § 581 of Chapter 5 of the Code of Ordinances and tank structure and supports shall be approved by the Buildings Superintendent. The covers of all unenclosed standpipe tanks shall be conical in shape and protected with a type of roofing approved by the Buildings Superintendent.

(k) Reserve for standpipe. Gravity tanks, intermediate tanks and pressure tanks shall contain not less than 3,500 gallons of water at all times, reserved solely for standpipe firelines purposes. When a gravity tank is to be used for both standpipe and house supply, the connection for the latter shall be made through the side of the tank above the level of the required standpipe reserve. Standpipe and sprinkler supplies may not be taken from one tank. Mercantile or Industrial Buildings in Group under the same ownership and operation: One gravity tank of sufficient water capacity to supply the largest unit of a group of separate and distinct buildings operating under one ownership, and located at such elevation that the bottom of the tank will be at least 20 feet above the roof of the highest building of the group, will be accepted as an adequate tank supply for the entire standpipe equipment, provided a dead riser is carried down from the bottom of the tank to an underground header system having a Post Indicator control valve for each building unit, the P.I. Valves to be located as the Fire Commissioner may direct. All underground piping shall be extra heavy cast iron. When in his opinion, the area covered is excessive or the occupancy is such that an unusual fire hazard is introduced, the Fire Commissioner may require additional protection in the nature of additional tank or tanks located remote from any other standpipe tank, or additional water supply in the main gravity tank, or a fire pump and suction tank of size and capacity to be determined by the Fire Commissioner or the Board of Standards and Appeals, or a combination of any of the foregoing supplies.

(l) Standard source of supply. Gravity tank located so that the bottom of same will be not less than 20 feet above the roof level and of a capacity as stated elsewhere in these rules and direct connected to the standpipe equipment by pipes of the same diameter as that of the largest riser. Tanks may not be fed through the standpipe fireline, but shall be fed through a separate line at least 2 inches in diameter, discharging into the top of the tank above the overflow level through the side or through the bottom, that portion of the pipe within the tank to be of brass or bronze. An electric or steam pump of sufficient capacity to deliver 65 gallons of water per minute at the tank shall be provided, or if the pressure in the service line is sufficient and the plumbing is such that a minimum of 65 gallons of water per minute may be delivered to the tank, connection to the house water service main in the basement, cellar or lowest story may be used instead of pump. The sprinkler and standpipe tanks may be fed from a common source of supply, either a pump or a direct service main connection, when a ball (float) valve is provided for each tank. Floats shall be of copper.

   Overflow. An overflow of diameter at least as large as that of the fill line shall be provided for each standpipe tank. It may be run through the bottom of the tank, provided it is of brass or bronze and has no joint inside of the tank, otherwise it must be brought through the side of the tank, 3 inches below the top (of sides). Overflows shall terminate in a 90 degree elbow not more than 24 inches above the roof.

When the area of a penthouse exceeds 50% of the roof area or when it exceeds an area of 2500 sq. ft., the bottom of the tank shall be required to be not less than 20 ft. above the level of the penthouse roof. In existing standpipe equipment the bottom of the gravity standpipe tank shall not be required to be more than 20 feet above the outlet in the highest story.

   Access to tank. Access to the top of each standpipe tank shall be provided by means of an iron gooseneck ladder of substantial construction and rigid bracing.

(m) High and low alarm and flow tell tale. Every tank used for standpipe fireline purposes shall be provided with either an electric high and low water alarm as defined elsewhere in these rules or with a flow tell tale constructed as provided for elsewhere in these rules, in order that it may be determined at any time whether or not the required standpipe reserve is in the tank, except that where the house water supply is taken from the same tank as the standpipe supply and not from any other tank, neither a high and low alarm or a flow tell tale need be provided when an automatic tank filling pump is installed.

(n) Check valve. There shall be provided in a horizontal run of pipe below the main roof in the line connecting the standpipe tank with the standpipe riser an approved type swing check valve opening toward riser, except that where a siamese steamer connection has been omitted under these rules, no check valve shall be required. An O. S. &amp; Y. gate valve shall be provided on each side of the check valve and shall be sealed open in an approved manner.

(o) Heating of tanks. All tanks used for standpipe supply purposes shall be heated by means of steam supplied through a brass coil with brass fittings and of a type and radiating surface as prescribed by the Board of Standards and Appeals. The heater shall be fed through a 1 1/4-inch steam line with a 1-inch return, separately trapped. The water in the tank shall be maintained at a temperature above 40 F., which condition, if obtained by a variation of the arrangement of coil as may be specified by the Board of Standards and Appeals, will be acceptable. Tanks supplying both standpipe and house service lines in hotels, hospitals and institutes using the tank supply seven days a week shall not require heating. If in an adequately heated enclosure, interior heating of tanks shall not be required.

(p) Suction tanks. Suction tanks shall be of at least 5000 gallons effective water capacity reserved for fire pump use exclusively and shall be constructed of steel or reinforced concrete, located in the cellar, or in the basement or lowest story if there is no cellar under the building. The Fire Commissioner may permit suction tanks to be located in a separate enclosure or building provided they are accessible and in his judgment such location will be more practicable. Suction tanks shall be fed by a connection at least 3 inches in diameter taken direct from the public street main. The supply shall enter the suction tank above the top or through the side near the top of the tank and shall be controlled by a bronze ball cock and copper float.

(q) Pressure tanks. Pressure tanks shall contain the quantities of water as specified for gravity tanks, but in no case may a tank have a capacity in excess of 9,000 gallons. Pressure tanks shall be located in the top story or penthouse and shall be properly protected against freezing. The tank shall be kept two-thirds full of water under a pressure of 30 lbs. per square inch and shall be so located and proportioned that a pressure of not less than 15 lbs. per square inch will be available at the hose outlet in the highest story. The air compressor shall be of sufficient capacity to increase the air pressure at an average of one pound in two minutes in each pressure tank. The connection to riser or risers, the emergency drain and the means of access to tank shall be as required for gravity tank in 2 RCNY § 10-03(l). Pressure and water level gauges shall be required. The means of supplying water shall be as required for gravity tanks except that filling must be done without reducing the pressure in the tank.

(g) Conduit. 

   (1) The control cable for the shut-off valve shall be run in galvanized wrought iron or steel pipe or other standard and approved conduit not less than 1/2 inch in pipe size. The pipe or conduit line must be water-tight and continuous from the casing enclosing the operating mechanism of the valve to the control box on outside of building. The cable shall not be exposed at any point in its length.

   (2) All ends of pipe or conduit, not only at valve and control box terminals, but in the run of the piping, shall be carefully reamed so as to remove burrs and fins caused by cutting-off tools, which would interfere with the movement of the cable in the run, or cut, or wear the cable. Unions should not be employed in making joints.

   (3) Pipe or conduit must be rigidly and permanently secured in position. Pipe straps and hangers of standard forms may be employed for this purpose. In every case supports must be provided at points sufficiently numerous to prevent sagging. Pipe straps (if used) must be of metal of sufficient thickness to insure a permanent fastening and must be thoroughly coated to prevent corrosion.

(h) Bends and offsets. 

   (1) Bends of small radius or through much of an arc, introduce possibilities of binding of the cable or of an appreciable friction resisting the pull of the cable: therefore, approved roller fittings shall be required wherever the pipe or conduit is bent to a radius of less than 4 inches, or wherever the bend is through an arc exceeding 15 degrees except as outlined for offsets.

   (2) When connections to control boxes are made from below it is frequently necessary to make an offset in the conduit to avoid a water table or other part of a building wall. One offset of not more than 2 inches will be permitted for each installation at such points. The bends in the pipe forming the offsets must be carefully made to avoid cracking the enamel or galvanized coating or the flattening or cracking of the pipe or conduit. The amount of offset shall not exceed 2 inches and the length of the offset shall not be less than five times the amount of the offset. For example, a 2-inch offset must be at least 10 inches long. Single offsets only shall be permitted. Double offsets are not acceptable.

      (i) Roller fittings. For turns in the conduit greater than those mentioned above, approved roller fittings shall be used. No roller fittings turning more than 90 degrees from a straight line shall be used.

(j) Automatic control. The fusible link which controls actuation of the valve in the event of direct heat, shall melt at not less than 225 degrees F. and shall be so arranged as to in no way interfere with the manual means of shutting off the gas which is controlled by the handle in box placed on the face of the building. Only approved fusible links shall be used. Automatic control shall in no way depend upon electric current for its operation.

(k) Production tests at factory. Valves must be tight under the following tests: (1) Valves shall be mounted in the position in which they are designed to operate. Normal city gas pressure or equivalent air pressure shall be applied to the inlet side and the valve shall completely shut off the gas or air when closed as in normal operation.

   (2) To determine whether the valve shuts off tightly under this test, a tube shall be connected with the outlet side of the valve and the outer end of the tube shall be immersed in water to a depth not exceeding one (1) inch, indicating leakage by bubbles rising through the water from the end of this tube.

   (3) Valves, after this test, shall be capable of shutting off ten (10) pounds air pressure applied to the inlet side; to determine whether the valve is tight, the test procedure shall be as indicated in the preceding test.

   (4) Valve bodies shall be strong enough to withstand, without leakage, one hundred (100) pounds pressure applied from either end with the other end closed. In this test the entire valve, including the stuffing box, shall be completely immersed in water, so that leakage will be indicated by bubbles rising through the water.

   (5) The fusible link connections of each valve shall be carefully tested to avoid prematurely operating the gas shut-off valve through vibration or concussion. The construction of the fusible link connections shall be so designed and made that the automatic feature will not operate through vibration or concussion.

   (6) The entire process of manufacture of the valves shall be subject to inspection and review and each valve shall be tested at the factory by a recognized laboratory or agency with facilities for making the test prescribed by the Board of Standards and Appeals, and each valve must bear satisfactory evidence that it has been so tested.

   (7) Manufacturers of gas shut-off valves must submit the name or names of said laboratories or agencies to the Fire Commissioner or the Tenement House Department Commissioner, in their respective jurisdictions, with satisfactory evidence of their ability and facilities to properly carry out said tests.

   (8) Valves and operating mechanism shall be so designed and constructed that they will withstand deteriorating effects or corrosion, as evidenced by operating tests.

(l) Installation and inspection tests. 

   (1) After shut-off valve is installed, it shall be set and operated to determine that proper closure is secured by operating the control handle. Particular care should be taken to observe that when operating the control handle, no part of the cable or of its attachment to the valve interferes in any way with the positive closure of the valve.

   (2) After the above test, all gas outlets in the building must be inspected to insure their being closed before the valve shall be set and the gas turned on. Valve and connections shall also be tested for leaks by applying a solution of soap and water to all parts, including connections to gas piping.

   (3) After the valve has been used to shut off gas, it shall be reset only by authorized corporations, firms or individuals, or by members of the Fire Department.

   (4) Operating and installation corporations, firms or individuals responsible for the installation of the gas shut-off valves shall permanently maintain properly equipped service stations in each of the boroughs where they install valves.

(m) Inspection. Gas shut-off valves and installations shall be inspected at least once a year by members of the Fire Department or the Tenement House Department, in their respective jurisdictions, or by corporations, firms or individuals authorized to install gas shut-off valves, as determined by the Fire Commissioner or the Tenement House Department Commissioner, in their respective jurisdictions.

   (6) Beams. The use of continuous beams and girders, shall be permitted provided their welded connections be designed to transmit the stresses involved in, continuous beam construction and columns are designed for the moment added by such construction. At the ends of non-continuous beams, the connections shall be designed to avoid excessive secondary stresses due to bending.

   (7) Fillet welds. Intermittent fillet welds may be used to transfer calculated stress across a joint of faying surfaces when the strength required is less than that developed by a continuous fillet weld of the smallest practical size. The effective length of any segment of intermittent fillet welding shall be not less than 4 times the weld size with a minimum of 1 1/2 inches. The clear spacing between the effective lengths of such segments at the edges of plates and the unsupported edges of rolled shapes carrying calculated stress shall not exceed the following number of times the thickness of the thinner part joined: 16 times for compression 24 times for tension and shall, in no case, be more than 12 inches. The effective length of longitudinal fillet welds at the edges of built-up members shall be not less than the width of the component part joined.

   (8) Welds in slot or holes.

      (vi) The ends of slot shall be semi-circular or shall have the corners rounded to a radius not less than the thickness of the part containing the slot.

   (9) Field riveted, bolted and welded connections.

      (i) In tier structures less than 125 feet high, in which the height is less than two and one-half times the minimum horizontal dimension, all column splices and field connections may be bolted.

      (ii) In structures in which the height is over 100 feet and is more than two and one-half times the minimum horizontal dimension, and in structures 100 feet or less in height in which the height is more than four times the minimum horizontal dimension, column splices and connection to columns shall be riveted, welded or bolted with high strength bolts.

      (iii) In structures over 125 feet in height and in all structures of a special character, connections of beams and girders to columns, and beams and girders bracing columns shall be riveted, welded or bolted with high strength bolts. Column splices in structures 200 feet or more in height shall be riveted, welded or bolted with high strength bolts. Column splices in tier structures less than 200 feet high (except as provided in the preceding sub-paragraph) may be bolted.

      (iv) All other field connections may be bolted except that, in all structures, the connections for supports for running machinery or other moving loads shall be riveted, welded or bolted with high strength bolts.

      (v) Within existing structures, steel work for alterations, or additions (except to the main structural framework), which do not affect existing column splices, connections and other riveted or welded work, may be bolted.

      (vi) For the purpose of these rules, a tier shall be considered a single story.

   (10) Completion of work. Upon the completion of all structural welding operations, the registered architect or licensed professional engineer responsible for the design of the structure shall certify to the Borough Superintendent that the fabrication and welding of such structure have been properly inspected and that the requirements of his design and these rules have been fulfilled in every respect by the contractor who has done the welding.

      (iv) Each of the specimens shall be bent in a jig having a working contour shown in Figure 7 and otherwise substantially in accordance with that figure. Any convenient means may be used for moving the plunger member with relation to the die member. The specimens shall be placed on the die member of the jig with the weld at mid-span. One of the specimens removed from the 3/8 inch groove welded material shall be placed with the face of the weld directed toward the gap, the other with the root of the weld directed toward the gap. Both specimens removed from the 1 inch groove-welded material shall be placed with that side showing the greater defects, if any, directed toward the gap. Both fillet welded specimens shall be placed with the root of the weld directed toward the gap. The two members of the jig shall be forced together until the curvature of the specimen is such that a 1/32 inch diameter wire cannot be passed between the curved portion of the plunger member and the specimen. The specimen shall then be removed from the jig.

      (v) The convex surface of each specimen tested shall be examined for the appearance of cracks or other open defects. Any specimen in which a crack or other open defect is present after bending, exceeding 1/8 inch measured in any direction, shall be considered as having failed. Cracks occurring on the corners of the specimen during testing shall not be considered unless there is definite evidence that they result from slag inclusions or other internal defects.

      (vi) In the foregoing tests, base material and filler metal, conforming to the specifications listed in 2 RCNY § 25-01(h), in an amount adequate to provide for the removal of the required specimens shall be provided.

   (2) The agency as provided for in 2 RCNY § 25-01(j)(1) shall take adequate means to assure that the preparing, oxygen cutting, assembling and welding of the joints of the structure conform to the design and that the resulting structure is free from deficiencies and injurious defects. He shall keep and submit daily to the registered architect or licensed professional engineer responsible for the work and to the Building Commissioner adequate records of the progress of the work, of difficulties experienced, and of his decision of acceptance and rejection. His records shall allocate a definite and personal responsibility for his acceptance of every weld as to size, location, type of filler metal used and quality of workmanship, and shall evidence that no weld called for in the design has been omitted. He shall require that each welder place his identification symbol on his work, and the inspector after inspecting each weld shall do likewise.

      (i) He shall inspect for defects and irregularities, plate cracks adjacent to or behind welds, crater cracks or cracks in the weld metal.

      (ii) He shall gauge all welds for deficiency of throat or other critical cross-section.

      (iii) He shall carefully observe and reject unallowable or out of tolerance undercutting, overlap or lack of fusion at edges of weld, lack of penetration, or porosity, location of craters, size and shape of bead, and order occasional chipping to determine penetration and correct all or any irregularities of workmanship contrary to the design.

      (iv) He shall maintain a staff of inspectors numerous enough to provide one inspector for every twelve welders on each job at all times provided that the welders are within five tiers of each other.

   (3) The contractor who is to do welding shall be approved by the Borough Superintendent. He shall submit to the Borough Superintendent a statement that the work will be done in accordance with these rules and the Administrative Code and shall include in such statement, the detailed procedure he proposes to follow, which shall include the following: That each welder or group of welders shall be under the continual supervision of an experienced foreman. That only welders qualified under these rules be employed. Each welder shall exhibit, when required, his Certificate of Qualification. That each welding foreman shall be provided with proper gauges to check his work. That the foreman shall be able to read blueprints and shall lay out and allocate the work each welder is to perform and he shall carefully observe the burn-off of the electrode; the fusion, and penetration of crater; the formation of the bead; and the sound of the arc. That only the base metal and filler metal conforming to the job specifications and these rules be used. That the welding equipment furnished shall have proper characteristics to allow good work. That whenever deemed necessary by the Borough Superintendent, such tests of the finished welds, shall be made as required by him.

   (4) Daily inspection shall be made of preheating equipment to see that it is functioning properly. Preheat drying cabinets for low hydrogen electrodes shall be maintained within easy access of all welding operators. Above information to be included in daily welding inspectors reports.

   (5) Before equipment used to supply welding current is used at the job site, it shall be tested at job site by the testing laboratory responsible for the welding to ascertain proper functioning of equipment and to establish the arc voltage and current produced by this equipment. This certification shall be filed with the welding report.

(k) Workmanship on welded structures &amp; testing. 

   (1) The quality of welds permitted under this title shall conform to the requirements of Section 2, Design of Welded Connections – of AWS D1.0-66 – Code for Welding in Building Construction and addenda dated September 1967, of the American Welding Society.

   (2) The arrangement of the joints to be welded shall be such as to enable the welder to have an unobstructed view of the surfaces to be welded at all times during the welding operation.

   (3) Welds found deficient in dimensions, but not in quality may be enlarged by additional welding. Where a deficient weld renders the weld inaccessible, or has caused new conditions which would make reinforcement dangerous or ineffectual, the weld shall be removed and original conditions restored or in lieu thereof a revised design, correcting this condition, shall be submitted to the Borough Superintendent. In removing defective parts of a weld, the gouging, chipping or grinding, shall not extend into the base metal any substantial amount beyond the depth of weld penetration unless cracks or other defects exist in the base metal.

   (4) All complete-penetration butt welds, except when produced with the aid of a backing or welded from both sides in square edge material not more than 5/16 inch thick with root opening not less than one-half the thickness of the thinner part joint, shall have the root of the initial layer gouged or chipped out on the back side before welding is started from that side. Butt welds made with the use of a backing of the same material as the base metal shall have the weld metal thoroughly fused with the backing. Backing strips may be removed by pneumatic chipping or carbon arc gouging, after welding is completed, provided the weld surface is left flush or slightly convex with full throat thickness.

   (5) To insure soundness, the ends of butt welds carrying stresses approaching the maximum allowable working stress shall be extended past the edges of the parts joined, by means of short extension bars providing a similar joint preparation and having a width not less than the thickness of the thicker part joined. If extension bars are removed upon completion of the weld, the ends of the weld shall be smooth and flush with the edges of the abutting parts. Where the metal is not more than 3/4 inch in thickness, the extension bars may be omitted if the ends of the butt weld are chipped or cut down to solid metal, and side welds are applied to fill out the ends to the same reinforcement as the faces of the weld.

   (6) Tack welds located where the final welds will later be made shall be subject to the same quality requirements as the final welds. Where tack welds are encountered in the final welding, they shall be cleaned and fused thoroughly with the final weld. Defective, cracked or broken tack welds shall be removed before final welding.

   (7) Surfaces to be welded shall be free from mill scale, rust, paint or other foreign matter. A thin coat of linseed oil or its equivalent over the surfaces to be welded need not be removed. These provisions shall apply to new structures and where new steel is to be welded to steel in any existing structure. Structural steel shall not be painted on any areas where shop or field welding is to be performed except that a coat of linseed oil without pigment may be used for temporary protection. However, structural members which have been painted, may be welded, provided that the paint is completely removed from the areas to be welded. Parts which are welded in the shop, to be erected by bolts or rivets, shall receive the usual painting if any is required after the shop welding is finished. Parts to be field welded shall receive a coat of linseed oil after shop work is completed, and after erection and field welding, they shall be given two coats of acceptable metal protection of painting as required.

   (8) Where rivets are under load there shall be no welding at the connections between structural members so riveted unless precautions are taken to prevent loss of tension of rivet in a manner approved by the Borough Superintendent.

   (9) In assembling and during welding the component parts of a built up member shall be held by sufficient clamps or other adequate means shall be employed for temporarily fastening the members together and bracing the framework until the joints are welded. This shall consist of erection bolts or positive devices imparting sufficient strength and stiffness to resist all temporary weights and lateral forces, including wind. For all welded structures, erection bolts, or equivalent means shall be employed for temporarily supporting the members, and existing loads, and for insuring proper alignment. The temporary support of girders carrying columns or other heavy loads shall be made rigid by such means as shall be designed by the registered architect or licensed professional engineer in charge and approved by the Borough Superintendent. In tier building erection, members shall not be erected more than two tiers, or more than one-column length above any column connections yet unwelded unless adequate temporary connections are provided.

   (10) The welder shall be protected by adequate covering against high winds, rain, snow or sleet. Where there is an accumulation of water, ice or snow in the joint to be welded, same shall be removed and the joint made dry before welding. No welding shall be done when the temperature of the base metal is below O°F. At temperatures between 32° and O°F. the surface of all areas within three inches of the point where a weld is to be started shall be heated to a temperature specified in the Administrative Code.

   (11) Non-destructive testing equipment.

      (i) Non-Destructive Systems, methods and techniques for testing shop and field welds may be used on condition that all such systems, methods, techniques and apparatus shall first be approved by the Board. Such systems may use x-ray, radiography, magnetic particle, ultrasonic, dye penetrants, etc.

      (ii) The results of actual performance tests by each system for which approval is sought shall be the criteria determining the limitations under which approvals shall be granted.

      (iii) Each system of testing shall prove its unfailing ability to distinguish between good and faulty welds, by testing at least two samples of every class, size and type of weld, for which approval is sought. These weld samples shall be tested under conditions duplicating the conditions met in actual practice, such as:

         (A) Shop welds or field welds or both.

         (B) For field welds the test samples shall be temporarily installed in the most inaccessible parts of a structure where welding is to be tested.

         (C) Flat, vertical or overhead positions.

(n) Use of CO2 systems and liquefiers. (1) Carbon dioxide liquefier converting systems for filling portable cylinders shall not be used in any building occupied in whole or in part as a residence or as a multiple dwelling, or as place of public assembly, or in a building not used exclusively for manufacturing purposes.

   (2) Except in buildings used exclusively for the manufacture of carbon dioxide or other compressed gases, not more than 8 liquefiers of a maximum combined capacity of 1,200 lbs. of carbon dioxide shall be headed in a battery and not more than one such battery shall be permitted in a building.

   (3) Liquefiers may be manifolded only by the use of extra heavy steel or wrought iron pipe, or extra heavy seamless copper or brass tubing, of not larger than 3/4 in. I.P.S. Fittings shall be high pressure forged steel or extra heavy bronze hydraulic type.

   (4) Each manifold shall be protected by a frangible disc safety device of the same size and type as those prescribed for the liquefier, and designed to release at a pressure of not more than 2,000 lbs. per sq. in. In addition, the liquid manifold shall be protected by a spring safety valve so set as to relieve the pressure at not more than 1,600 lbs. per sq. in.

   (5) When carbon dioxide gas is conducted through pressure reducing valve between liquefier and point of use, the use of a heater will be permitted, but said heater shall be so arranged that heat may be applied indirectly. This heater shall consist of a coil immersed in water. The source of heat shall then be applied to the water but not directly to the coil.

(o) Test of piping. Each liquefier or battery of liquefiers to be used for the filling of portable cylinders or other containers with liquid carbon dioxide and all the piping connected thereto, shall be hydrostatically tested in the presence of the representatives of the Fire Chief and Commissioner before the solid carbon dioxide is first put into the system. A hydrostatic pressure of 2,400 lbs. per sq. in. shall be maintained for fifteen minutes, released for five minutes, and again applied for a period of fifteen minutes without any visible leak or reduction of pressure. This test shall be repeated at least every five years.

(p) Approval systems for filling portable cylinders. Each liquefier or battery of liquefiers used for filling portable cylinders or other containers, shall be permanently labeled or marked showing the Fire Department Certificate of Approval Number together with date of last test.

(q) Acceleration. Defrosting or acceleration of liquefication, shall be by use of water only, the water shall be of a temperature not above 85 degrees Fahrenheit.

(r) CO2 portable cylinders. 

   (1) Portable cylinders or other containers to be filled with liquid carbon dioxide shall be constructed and marked in accordance with the Specifications of the Interstate Commerce Commission for carbon dioxide cylinders and shall have been tested within intervals of not more than five years as evidenced by official marking. Cylinders not so constructed and marked shall not be filled with carbon dioxide.

   (2) The maximum filling of liquid carbon dioxide, with one pound allowable variation in each cylinder, shall not be over 20 lbs. for standard cylinders 5 1/2 in. in diameter by 51 in. long, nor over 50 lbs. for standard cylinder 8 1/2 in. in diameter by 51 in. long and larger. No cylinder shall be filled with carbon dioxide to more than 68 percent of the water capacity, by weight, of the cylinder.

   (3) The amount of liquid carbon dioxide charged into portable cylinders or other containers shall be determined by weight by use of a dial scale having a movable indicator, and this weight shall also be checked after disconnecting from the charging line.

(s) Existing installations. Liquefiers or converters to which these rules and regulations cannot be applied, may be maintained and operated, if approved by the Board of Standards and Appeals, under such conditions as are deemed necessary in the interest of public safety. These regulations apply to installations or alterations made prior to December 6, 1968, the effective date of Local Law 76 of 1968 (Building Code).
