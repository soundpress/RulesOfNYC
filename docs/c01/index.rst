Factors the Board will consider in determining whether the revision is technical or minor include: whether the revision would have any material impact on the Board's findings, whether the revisions were discussed at a public session by the Board, or whether the revision is essentially an administrative correction.






*§ 1-11.10 Late Submissions.* ::


In order to ensure a predictable and timely review of an application, submissions may not be accepted after the date established by the Chair.






*§ 1-12 Disposition of Applications.* ::


A final determination of the Board will be in the form of a written resolution. Such resolution will state the rule, regulation, order, requirement, decision, or determination upon which the application has been made, and will set forth the Board's findings and conclusion. The Board may reverse, affirm, in whole or in part, or modify a rule, regulation, order, requirement, decision, or determination, or it may dismiss an application for lack of jurisdiction or prosecution, or as moot.

An application must receive three (3) affirmative votes to be granted. If an application fails to receive three (3) affirmative votes, the action will be deemed denied.

*§ 1-12.2 Withdrawal.* ::


The Board may consider a request to withdraw an application made by the applicant at any time before the Board's final determination.

If the request to withdraw is made before the hearing has been closed, the Board may permit withdrawal without prejudice upon request.

If the request to withdraw is made after the hearing is closed, the Board may permit withdrawal without prejudice for good cause only. If it determines that proper enforcement or public policy would thereby be served, the Board may refuse the withdrawal or it may condition the withdrawal with prejudice on the refiling of a future application for the same relief.

If the request to withdraw the application is made, and a motion to vote is pending, such motion will have precedence.






*§ 1-12.3 Dismissal.* ::


The Board may, in its discretion, dismiss an application for failure to prosecute, with or without prejudice, depending on the circumstances of the application. Further, the Board may, at its discretion, dismiss an application where a defect in the application has not been corrected or where an incomplete application has not been completed in a timely manner. The executive director will send out a dismissal letter informing the applicant that the application will be dismissed if the requisite correction or information is not forthcoming within thirty (30) days of receipt of such letter. The Board may grant an extension to the thirty (30) day period upon request in writing for additional time to correct or complete an application, provided that the applicant presents reasonable circumstances for delay and provides a timetable for a subsequent submission.

(b) Can speak and understand the English language.

(c) Has knowledge of response routes to buildings serviced by the Agency.

(d) Is familiar with each premises to which they respond.

(e) Is knowledgeable in the use of the mobile radio. When the Agency receives a telephone notice of alarm from a central station, it shall immediately dispatch a qualified elevator operator with keys to the building and to the elevator who shall open the building and place the elevator in operating condition and assist the Fire Department in gaining access to any portion of the building. Such elevator operator shall have for his use a motor vehicle furnished by such Agency kept in a building or open lot or street within 100 feet of the office of the Agency. Such motor vehicle shall be one of two maintained by the Agency at each office exclusively for responding to alarms and shall be equipped with mobile radios capable of receiving and transmitting with their office. In the office of the Agency at least two elevator operators shall be available to respond to alarms. There shall be a key board in each office with keys to the entrance door and elevator kept properly tagged for all buildings being served by the Agency. In the event there are several elevators in a building, the owner shall specify, subject to the approval of the Fire Department and the Board, which elevator or elevators, not exceeding two, shall be available under this service and such available elevator or elevators shall be parked at the first floor. Hoistway doors leading thereto shall be equipped with a parking lock or other device satisfactory to the Department of Buildings, so arranged as to prevent the opening of the doors from the landing side with the service key unless the car is at the landing and such key shall open no other door. A duplicate of such parking lock key shall be maintained in a break glass box in the lobby adjacent to such available elevators. Power for available elevators shall be on at all times, controlled by a switch in the car and there shall be installed at the main power switch in the main panel board, or in the motor room, a disconnecting switch so arranged that the switch can be readily disconnected for service, repair and inspection, and in any emergency. To accomplish this, a standard approved type cabinet switch shall be used and the cabinet and projecting handle for the manual application of the switch shall be locked in a closed position with a key to the lock contained in a break-glass box located adjacent to the switch with a sign conspicuously displayed on the switch cabinet cover that such switch is locked in a closed position in accordance with this section and that the key located in the adjacent break-glass box may be used to obtain access to such switch for repair, service and inspection purposes only or in the event of emergency. Each building subject to the provisions of this section shall be inspected by the Agency at least twice each week and records kept of such inspections; and that at such inspections the elevator doors, keys and other equipment pertaining to the operation of the service shall be examined to maintain safe conditions. In order to insure familiarity with, and knowledge of each building, these inspections shall be the responsibility of, and shall be carried out by those employees who have been designated as qualified elevator operators whose duties are responding to alarms in accordance with this section. The inspections shall be conducted after the normal business hours of the building. The Agency shall keep such records and forward reports of its service as the Fire Commissioner shall require. In the event an Agency providing the response service is to be changed, the request for change shall be in the form of an application to the Board of Standards and Appeals to amend a previous resolution relating to the specific building where a change in the agency providing the response service is to take place. A copy of the application to amend shall be submitted to the Fire Department at the time of filing with the Board. The terms of this section shall be applied only upon the filing of an appeal by an owner of a building of the type and within the area described, for a variance based on a decision of the Fire Commissioner and favorable action taken by the Board. In the event the owner of a premises which is subject to a variance conditioned upon the terms of this section discontinues the service with the Agency, the Agency shall immediately notify the Fire Commissioner in writing. The term of variance granted hereunder shall not exceed ten (10) years from the date of the variance. During such term, the Board reserves the right to amend the requirements.

Upon approval of preliminary plans such number of sets of clean, corrected plans on cloth as the Fire Commissioner may require, not exceeding three (3), shall be filed for final approval of the Fire Commissioner. A certified copy of the approved plans shall be forwarded to the Department of Buildings by the Bureau of Fire Prevention. If the structure is equipped with a standpipe (fire line) the plans shall include a note to that effect. When entirely completed in accordance with the approved plans, application shall be made to the Bureau of Fire Prevention for test and acceptance of the completed installation. When the sprinkler equipment is approved the applicant will be so advised in writing by the Bureau of Fire Prevention.

(d) Definitions.

   Automatic extinguisher systems. "Automatic extinguisher systems" shall consist of a system of piping connected to one or more acceptable sources of water supply, provided with distributing devices so arranged and located as to discharge and diffuse automatically an effective stream or spray over the interior of the building area.

(e) Classification of sprinkler systems. For the purpose of these rules, sprinkler systems shall be classified as:

   (1) Automatic Wet Pipe Systems, in which all pipes and sprinkler heads are at all times filled with water;

   (2) Automatic Dry Pipe Systems, in which the pipes and sprinkler heads are filled with air, either compressed or at atmospheric pressure, and the water supply is controlled by a Dry Pipe Valve as defined in § 10-02(11)(5) of these rules.

Gravity tank or tanks shall not be required to be elevated above the highest sprinklers in penthouse having an area less than 2,500 sq. ft., unless such penthouse contains a hazardous occupancy, or is used for the storage of combustible material. Where a split system is installed the bottom of the tank or tanks need not be elevated more than 3 feet above the main roof or 20 feet above the highest sprinkler fed from an intermediate tank. Where a tank capacity in excess of 25,000 gallons is required by this subdivision (h), the amount of water in excess of 25,000 gallons shall be provided in separate tanks not grouped together except when tanks of unlimited capacities are supported on structures altogether independent of buildings. The tank shall be filled through a fixed pipe, independent of the sprinkler piping, not less than two (2) inches in size, discharging into the top of the tank. The water supply and connections shall be capable of supplying the tank at a rate of not less than sixty-five (65) gallons per minute. The filling pipe shall be carried up inside a frost-proof casing and may extend through tank bottom to discharge at top of tank above full water level. The portion of pipe inside tank must be of brass or copper or other noncorrosive material. Tanks shall not be fed through sprinkler lines. The sprinkler and standpipe tanks may be fed from a common source of supply, either a pump or a direct service main connection, provided that there are separate feed mains from the basement or lowest story and a control valve in each feed line in a pump or engine room. The overflow pipe shall be not less than two (2) inches in diameter for tanks up to 30,000 gallons capacity and not less than three (3) inches in diameter for larger tanks.

   (3) In groups of pipes each water pipe is to be wrapped separately with the tar paper, but subsequent layers of felt and paper may be applied collectively if space does not permit individual wrapping.

   (4) Where a heating pipe is one of the group, the wrapping should be applied so that the hot line would serve all pipes in the enclosure. The initial wrapping of tar paper around each water pipe should be applied with laps down and the whole group wrapped with tar paper with laps up. If due to the position of the hot line sufficient air space would not insulate the hair felt, then protection to be effected by suitable separators, or a wrapping of asbestos paper instead of the tar paper around the group.

   (5) On vertical pipes particular provision to be made to prevent slipping and tearing of insulation due to its weight.

   (6) To prevent slipping away of insulation at point of entrance of pipes into a tank, and to shed leakage from slip joints, a 16 oz. duck to be provided, doubled and securely fastened to bottom of the tank overlapping inside and outside the insulation of the group for a distance of 18" below the tank. This duck to be well coated with paint. Loose hair felt to be packed about connections at tank bottom to safeguard against settling.

When it is desired to use pipe of larger size than eight (8) inches in diameter, special ruling will be required by the administrative official having jurisdiction as to the permissibility of its use and the number of heads that may be fed thereby. Where practicable, it is desirable to arrange the piping so that the number of heads on a branch line will not exceed eight. When the piping is arranged on the "gridiron" plan, the permissible number of heads may be doubled, provided the feed main is of the size indicated in the schedule for the total number of heads. Where feed mains supply branch lines of only two heads each, the conditions approach those of long single lines. Such feed mains shall usually be centrally supplied where there are over eight (8) or ten (10) branch lines. Branch lines up to fourteen (14) in number may be fed from end, provided a two and one-half (2 1/2) inch pipe does not supply more than sixteen (16) standard one-half (1/2) inch heads, in lieu of twenty (20). Buildings having slatted floors, or large unprotected floor openings without approved stops, shall be treated as one room with reference to the pipe sizes, and the feed main shall be of sufficient size to accommodate the number of heads called for. Larger pipe sizes than are allowed in the schedule for a given number of heads may be required wherever the construction or conditions introduce unusually long runs of feed mains or many angles. Buildings with blind attics with small, unprotected openings to floor below, may be piped from the system on the ceiling of floor below, provided pipe size schedule is not overloaded on sizes three (3) inches or under.

(cc) Feed mains. The size of feed mains shall not be less than the size of riser and shall be arranged to run as direct as possible from source of water supply to riser. Feed mains for stair or other towers without approved stops between floors, when piped on independent riser, shall be of sufficient size to accommodate the total number of sprinklers in such tower.

(dd) Risers. There shall be one or more separate risers in each building and in each section of the building divided by fire walls. Risers shall be arranged to provide "Center Central" or "Side Central" supply to feed main. Each riser shall be of sufficient size to supply all the heads on said riser in one story, according to the schedule of pipe sizes in § 10-02(r). If the conditions warrant, special permission will be granted allowing the heads in a fire section of small area to be fed from the risers in another section, provided the total number of heads in such area does not exceed the following number per floor:

   (1) For standard one-half (1/2) inch heads, 48.

   (2) For Conran one (1) inch heads, 12.

   (3) For Conran one and one-quarter (1 1/4) inch heads, 8. Risers shall not be located close to windows, properly protected from mechanical injury and freezing and shall be properly supported on foundations and by floor plates, clamps, couplings or approved hangers.

(ee) Connections prohibited. No connections, such as for sill cocks, house service or hose outlets, shall be made with a sprinkler system riser or any part thereof except as provided for in § 10-02(l).

(ff) Air lock adjustment. Where gravity and pressure tanks feed through a common discharge pipe or "dead riser" to the foot of a riser and an air lock is likely to develop the discharge pipe of the gravity tank shall connect with the discharge pipe, or "dead riser," forty (40) feet below the bottom of the pressure tank.

(gg) Pipes and fittings. All pipe shall be full-weight standard wrought iron or steel threaded pipe, well reamed and screwed up tight into fittings without reducing the waterway. Fittings shall be standard cast iron fittings, and shall be long turn pattern on feed mains and risers. Such fittings shall be designed and guaranteed for a working pressure of 150 pounds per square inch and must be capable of withstanding a hydrostatic test pressure of 750 pounds per square inch without failure. All pipe shall be secured to the ceiling, walls and other parts of the building with standard steel, wrought or malleable iron hangers. Extra heavy fittings shall be employed where the normal pressure in the pipe system exceeds one hundred and fifty (150) pounds per square inch, and shall be designed for a working pressure of 250 pounds per square inch and be capable of withstanding a hydrostatic test pressure of 1,250 pounds per square inch without failure. All underground pipe shall comply with the specifications for cast iron pipe of the American Water Works Association.

(hh) Protection of pipes and sprinklers. When exposed to moisture, sprinkler pipes and hangers shall be protected against corrosion whenever found necessary by thoroughly cleaning the pipe of all scale and grease and painting with a coat of red lead and linseed oil paint or other acceptable moisture resistive paint. When exposed to chemical fumes, the pipe and fittings shall be coated with graphite or other approved chemical resistive paint. Care shall be taken not to paint the sprinkler heads. Supply pipes of risers in low basements or low spaces under ground floors exposed to frost, shall be properly protected by a masonry or wood enclosure, properly heated, or filled with mineral wool, sawdust or tax mixed with granulated cork, extending below bottom of pipe and through the top flooring of ground floor, or the pipe shall be protected with three alternate layers of one-inch hair felt and building paper or by other approved method. When of wood, such enclosure shall be constructed double with a layer of tar paper between the two thicknesses of wood. Where risers, drains, heating pipes, etc., pass through cinder concrete floors or partitions, they shall be protected with a metal sleeve or be grouted with cement mortar. Wherever sprinklers are exposed to corrosion, the heads shall be protected with an approved hermetically sealed cover, or with an approved wax coating.

(ii) Drainage. All sprinkler pipe and fittings shall be so installed that they can be thoroughly drained, and where practicable, all piping shall be arranged to drain at the main drips. Drains or drip pipes shall be so arranged as not to expose any part of the sprinkler system to frost, and shall be so connected, either by check valves or other means, that they will not overflow domestic service or other connections to the same sewer or house drain, or if carried through the wall and exposed to the weather, they shall be fitted with hoods or down-turned elbows. Drains, pitched not less than one-quarter (1/4) inch in ten (10) feet, shall be installed: At the base of the main riser; At each alarm valve; At each dry-pipe valve; At each gravity tank; At each pressure tank; At each fire department connection; On each floor, if independent floor control valves are used; and At each supply main, when the water in the same cannot be removed through any of the above drains. Such drains shall be installed with controlling valves so that flowing tests may be made to determine if the water supplies or connections from yard mains to the inside of the building are in order without causing water damage or overflowing service connections to the same house drain. Any such drain shall be not less than two (2) inches in size except that drains at independent floor valves shall be not less than 1 inch in size where floor valves are not over 2 1/2 inches in size and 1 1/4 inches where floor valves are larger and connected to a main drain riser of not less than 1 1/2 inches in size. The drain at the main riser shall discharge into a cone or sight drain, or if carried through the wall and exposed to the weather, it shall be fitted with a hood or down-turned elbow. At an alarm valve at the top of a riser in a down-fed system a drain shall not be required. On automatic wet pipe systems, the horizontal branch pipes shall be pitched not less than one-quarter (1/4) inch in ten (10) feet to drain towards the sources of supply with drip valves at the low points. On automatic dry-pipe systems, branch pipes shall be pitched at least one-half (1/2) inch in ten (10) feet.

(jj) Test pipe. In all wet-pipe automatic sprinkler systems a test pipe of not less than 3/4 inch in diameter shall be connected directly with each system but shall be connected to a pipe of not less than 1 1/4 inches in diameter in upper story and arranged to discharge through a 1/2-inch brass outlet, preferably to a point where it can readily be seen. With long runs or many angles, size of test pipe should be increased to one (1) inch or larger. Controlling valve should be located at a sufficient distance from where the test pipe passes through the wall of the building so as to reduce to a minimum the chance of freezing of water in test pipe. In all dry-pipe automatic sprinkler systems a 3/4-inch inspector's test pipe shall be installed at the end of the most distant branch line and fitted with a 3/4-inch shut-off valve stopped with a brass plug.

(kk) Pressure gauges. A four and one-half (4 1/2) inch double-spring Bourdon pressure gauge shall be provided in all automatic sprinkler systems as follows: Above dry-pipe valves; Below dry-pipe valves; At the pressure tank; At the air compressor; Above the alarm valve; Below the alarm valve; and In the connections from city water supply. Provision may be made for taking the pressure both above and below the alarm valve and the dry-pipe valve with only one gauge at each valve. A gauge shall not be required at an alarm valve located at the top of a riser in a down-fed system. Gauge connections shall be taken from the supply main or riser and not from the two-inch drain or test pipe. Gauges shall be installed in a suitable place protected from freezing and be controlled by a valve with arrangements for draining. A plugged outlet, not less than one-quarter (1/4) inch in size, shall be located between each valve and gauge for purpose of installing the inspector's gauge.

(ll) Valves. 

   (1) All valves two (2) inches in diameter and under shall be of brass or bronze, or other approved non-corrodible material. Valves over two (2) inches in diameter shall be of brass, or bronze or iron body, brass mounted, or of other approved non-corrodible material. All sidewalk siamese inlet valves, caps and chains shall be of galvanized cast iron or other approved non-corrodible material. All gate valves shall be solid or double wedge disc, stuffing box pattern with hand wheel, outside screw and yoke, or other approved indicator pattern. All check valves shall be approved straightway regrinding pattern, so built that the clappers may be readily removed for repairs.

   (2) Water supply gate valves. The piping connecting each source of water supply with sprinkler system shall be provided with a gate valve of the outside screw and yoke type, sealed open and tagged to designate its purpose, so located as to control each source of water supply except that from Fire Department hose connections. All such gate valves shall be located within the building where easily visible and readily accessible and as close as possible to the supply inlet.

   (3) Water supply check valves. The piping connecting each source of water supply with the sprinkler system, including Fire Department connections, shall be provided with a check valve. On two-source systems, check valves shall have a gate valve on each side to permit repair of check without shutting off both supplies, except that where the two sources of supply consist of tanks located above the highest line of sprinklers, a gate valve need only be provided on the downstream side of each check valve.

   (4) Control valves. All automatic sprinkler systems shall be provided with a main control or shut-off valve arranged to be readily accessible as near the stairways or fire tower as possible and sealed in the open position; except that when the sprinkler system is fed from water supplies on the roof of the building, independent and readily accessible floor control valves, sealed in the open position, may be installed. When not more than ten (10) standard one-half (1/2) inch sprinkler heads or three (3) Conran heads in any automatic wet pipe system are exposed to cold and subject to freezing shut-off valves may be provided to discontinue the places which cannot be properly heated, shall be controlled by an automatic dry-pipe valve.

   (5) Dry-pipe valves. A dry-pipe valve shall be taken to mean a valve automatically controlling the water supply of the sprinkler system in such a manner that under normal conditions its piping system beyond the valve is maintained dry, but in the event of fire, the valve automatically releases the water into the sprinkler system, for fire extinguishing purposes. Dry-pipe valves shall, for the purpose of these rules, be classified as follows: Type A, in which the valve is actuated by the release of compressed air in the sprinkler piping system, due to the opening of a sprinkler head; and Type B, in which the valve is actuated by an approved trip under electric control of an approved automatic thermostatic fire alarm system. Dry-pipe valves shall be located as near as practicable to the sprinkler system in an enclosed and accessible place protected from mechanical injury and freezing. Automatic wet-pipe sprinkler systems in which only twenty-five percent (25%) of the heads are required to be maintained dry for protection from freezing, shall have only such heads under dry-pipe valve control.

      (i) When "Type A" valve is installed, the air pressure in sprinkler systems under such dry-pipe valve control shall not exceed forty (40) pounds per square inch, nor be permitted to fall below twenty-five (25) pounds per square inch, nor shall it be less than one-sixth (1/6) of the water pressure in any case. The air compressor shall have a capacity of not less than eleven (11) cubic feet per minute and the air supply for the pump shall be taken, if possible, from a room containing dry air, or it shall be passed through a drying chamber containing calcium chloride, in order to avoid the introduction of moisture into the system. The air pressure on such dry-pipe systems shall be maintained throughout the year. Not more than the following number of heads shall be controlled by one "Type A" dry-pipe valve:

      (ii) For standard one-half (1/2) inch heads     400

      (iii) For Conran one (1) inch heads     100

      (iv) For Conran one and one-quarter (1 1/4) inch heads      64

   Where equipped with an approved quick-opening device the following number of heads may be controlled by one "Type A" dry-pipe valve:

      (v) For Conran one (1) inch heads     150

      (vii) For Conran one and one-quarter (1 1/4) inch heads     96

      (viii) When "Type B" valve is installed the actuating alarm system shall be designed to operate at a temperature lower than that required to open the sprinkler heads, and all connections between the alarm system and the dry-pipe valve shall be adequately protected against injury of any kind. When required by the administrative official having jurisdiction, the dead end of every feed main in such dry-pipe system shall be provided with an air relief valve or vent, so constructed as to be normally open in order to permit the free escape of air from the system, but to close automatically against the escape of water. Not more than the following number of heads shall be controlled by one "Type B" dry-pipe valve:

      (ix) For standard one-half (1/2) inch heads     600

      (x) For Conran one (1) inch heads     150

      (xi) For Conran one and one-quarter (1 1/4) inch heads      96

   (6) Alarm valve. All automatic wet pipe sprinkler systems shall be equipped with an alarm valve so constructed that a flow of water through a one-half (1/2) inch orifice will operate an electric or mechanical gong. When an electrically operated alarm is installed in connection with an alarm valve or dry pipe valve, the installation shall be made in conformity with the provision of § 10-02(mm).

(mm) High and low water. Electric Alarm on Gravity and Pressure Tanks. All gravity tanks shall be equipped with a device to indicate when the water falls below or rises above the normal level in the tank, with an indicator and alarm located in the engineers' room near the pump. All gravity and pressure tanks shall be equipped with a high and low alarm as hereinafter specified. The high and low gravity and the high and low pressure electric alarm shall be so constructed and arranged that when the water falls below or rises above the normal level in the gravity tank, and when the pressure falls below or rises above the predetermined level in the pressure tank, an audible and visible signal will be given in either the pump room or engineer's room. The audible signaling device for high and low water and high and low pressure electric alarm shall consist of a vibrating gong of at least 3 inches in diameter of the enclosed type and arranged for conduit installation, the same to be operated automatically from an approved device indicating the level of water in the gravity tank and from the pressure gauge of pressure tank. The audible signaling device for the alarm and dry pipe valves shall consist of an enclosed type 6-inch vibrating gong arranged for conduit installation. A closed circuit annunciator shall be provided in connection with the alarm system. The high and low toll-tale electric connections shall be so constructed that it will not be affected by moisture and the parts shall be heavy and rugged. The float shall be of approved type. All wiring shall be installed in iron or steel conduits and the installation shall be in accordance with the provisions of Chapter 9 of the Code of Ordinances. Only approved closed circuit systems shall be installed. Control panels to operate the signaling equipment must be approved by the Board of Standards and Appeals. The control cabinet shall be located in the engineer's or pump room where it will be under the supervision of the person in charge of the sprinkler system. The following sources of energy may be employed and are given in their order of preference:

   (1) Public utility electric light and power systems.

   (3) Storage batteries in duplicate.

   (4) Primary batteries of the closed circuit type. When the system is connected to the 110 volt lighting service a suitable cut-out is to be provided and it shall be enclosed in a locked or sealed metal cabinet. The connection to the system shall be the first connection on the house side of and as near as practicable to the meter. When batteries are used to operate the system they shall be placed in an approved cabinet provided with a lock and key.

(nn) Heating of tanks. The water in all sprinkler tanks subject to freezing shall be protected by internally heating the water or enclosing the tank in a frost-proof house properly heated and lighted.

(oo) Concealed pipe systems. All pipe in concealed pipe systems shall be of standard full-weight wrought iron or steel, painted with two coats of protective paint, one before and one after installation. Such pipe as shall be installed in ducts or be encased in cement mortar shall be inspected prior to concealment. When installed in the concealed space between floor arches and ceiling, such pipe shall be supported by hangers and all pipe, fittings and hangers be protected with two coats of paint.

(pp) Preparation of building. Floor or wall openings and other structural defects which prevent the banking up of heated air and retard the automatic action of sprinkler heads shall be provided with the necessary curtain boards and draft stops to permit specific control of the fire by the local sprinklers. Curtain boards shall project at least three (3) inches below the lowest sprinkler.

(qq) Approval of sprinkler system. Before acceptance all automatic sprinkler systems, excluding the water supply tanks, shall be subjected after installation to a hydrostatic pressure test of at least one (1) hour's duration at not less than fifty (50) pounds per square inch in excess of that which will be normally carried and observed in the sprinkler system, such test pressure, however, to be not less than one hundred and fifty (150) pounds per square inch in any part of the system. All pressure tanks shall be tested after erection to a test pressure of one and one-half (1 1/2) times the working pressure. To prevent the possibility of serious water damage in case of a break, the pressure shall be maintained by a small pump, the main controlling gate being meanwhile kept shut. Brine or other corrosive chemicals shall not be used for testing systems. In automatic dry-pipe systems with "Type A" valve control, an air pressure of forty (40) pounds per square inch shall be pumped up, be held for twenty-four (24) hours, and all leaks stopped which allow a loss of pressure of over two (2) pounds per square inch for the twenty-four (24) hours. In the case of automatic dry-pipe systems with differential "Type A" valve, the valve shall be held off its seat during the test to prevent injuring the valve. Non-automatic systems shall be tested after installation at not less than fifty (50) pounds per square inch in excess of the pressure necessary to reach the highest line of sprinklers. All tests of installed systems shall be made by the contractor in the presence of the Fire Commissioner, or his authorized representative. No piping, devices nor any portion of a newly constructed sprinkler system shall be covered up or permanently concealed until tested by the Bureau of Fire Prevention and approved of in writing, except piping passing through floors, walls, partitions or beams for distances equal to the thickness of such floors, walls, partitions or beams.

Standpipe equipment shall consist of a system of piping connected to one or more approved sources of water supply and provided with sufficient number of hose outlets and hose located as hereinafter set forth, to make possible the covering of every portion of each floor area with a standpipe hose stream, except that where the 1st story or basement or both are occupied as stores without connection or communication with the entrance hall or stair enclosure to upper stories the Fire Commissioner may permit the omission of standpipe protection in such stores and, if so omitted, may prescribe such portable protection as he may deem necessary. Cellars, sub-cellars, basements, etc., shall be protected in the same manner as the stories above grade. Every standpipe (fireline) equipment shall be a Standard Wet System, except as hereinafter provided for:

   (1) In any building not exceeding 40 feet in height and 20,000 sq. ft. in area, a four-inch street supply system having one four (4) inch direct connection to a street main fed two ways or having one 4-in. direct connection to each of the two street mains on two street fronts, each main so fed that the shutting off of one main will not interfere with the supply of the other main, may be installed, provided there is sufficient pressure in the street main or mains to maintain a minimum of twenty-five (25) pounds per square inch static pressure at the highest hose outlet. Evidence establishing the fact that water main conditions and pressures are as required shall be submitted to the Fire Department.

   (2) In buildings as specified in General Resolution, Cal. 179-20-S, of the Board of Standards and Appeals, in which modified systems shall be accepted.

   (3) The installation of a pressure tank system, instead of a Standard Wet System, may be permitted by the Fire Commissioner when, in his opinion, the efficiency of the system will be not less than that of a Standard Wet System.

      (i) Classification of standpipe fireline equipment. For the purpose of these rules standpipe equipment shall be classified as:

   (1) Standard Wet System in which the pipes are of sizes as specified in § 581 of Chapter 5 of the Code of Ordinances, and in which the system is at all times filled with water from at least one standard source of supply.

   (2) Four-inch street connection system, in which the pipes are of sizes as specified in § 581 of Chapter 5 of the Code of Ordinances and the system is at all times filled with water from one or more 4-in. diameter direct connections to public water mains in the street.

   (3) Automatic dry systems, in which the pipes are of sizes as specified in § 581 of Chapter 5 of the Code of Ordinances, and are normally dry, the system being connected to a source of water supply controlled by an automatic dry pipe valve as defined elsewhere in these rules.

   (4) Modified systems, in which the piping is 2 1/2 inches in diameter and supplied from a street main through a tap of at least 2 in. in diameter, as per General Resolution 179-20-S of the Board of Standards and Appeals.

   (5) Pressure tank system, which will be similar to a standard wet system except that primary supply of water shall be obtained from a pressure tank as defined elsewhere in these rules.

(j) Tanks above roof. Construction shall be as per § 581 of Chapter 5 of the Code of Ordinances and tank structure and supports shall be approved by the Buildings Superintendent. The covers of all unenclosed standpipe tanks shall be conical in shape and protected with a type of roofing approved by the Buildings Superintendent.

(k) Reserve for standpipe. Gravity tanks, intermediate tanks and pressure tanks shall contain not less than 3,500 gallons of water at all times, reserved solely for standpipe firelines purposes. When a gravity tank is to be used for both standpipe and house supply, the connection for the latter shall be made through the side of the tank above the level of the required standpipe reserve. Standpipe and sprinkler supplies may not be taken from one tank. Mercantile or Industrial Buildings in Group under the same ownership and operation: One gravity tank of sufficient water capacity to supply the largest unit of a group of separate and distinct buildings operating under one ownership, and located at such elevation that the bottom of the tank will be at least 20 feet above the roof of the highest building of the group, will be accepted as an adequate tank supply for the entire standpipe equipment, provided a dead riser is carried down from the bottom of the tank to an underground header system having a Post Indicator control valve for each building unit, the P.I. Valves to be located as the Fire Commissioner may direct. All underground piping shall be extra heavy cast iron. When in his opinion, the area covered is excessive or the occupancy is such that an unusual fire hazard is introduced, the Fire Commissioner may require additional protection in the nature of additional tank or tanks located remote from any other standpipe tank, or additional water supply in the main gravity tank, or a fire pump and suction tank of size and capacity to be determined by the Fire Commissioner or the Board of Standards and Appeals, or a combination of any of the foregoing supplies.

(l) Standard source of supply. Gravity tank located so that the bottom of same will be not less than 20 feet above the roof level and of a capacity as stated elsewhere in these rules and direct connected to the standpipe equipment by pipes of the same diameter as that of the largest riser. Tanks may not be fed through the standpipe fireline, but shall be fed through a separate line at least 2 inches in diameter, discharging into the top of the tank above the overflow level through the side or through the bottom, that portion of the pipe within the tank to be of brass or bronze. An electric or steam pump of sufficient capacity to deliver 65 gallons of water per minute at the tank shall be provided, or if the pressure in the service line is sufficient and the plumbing is such that a minimum of 65 gallons of water per minute may be delivered to the tank, connection to the house water service main in the basement, cellar or lowest story may be used instead of pump. The sprinkler and standpipe tanks may be fed from a common source of supply, either a pump or a direct service main connection, when a ball (float) valve is provided for each tank. Floats shall be of copper.

   Overflow. An overflow of diameter at least as large as that of the fill line shall be provided for each standpipe tank. It may be run through the bottom of the tank, provided it is of brass or bronze and has no joint inside of the tank, otherwise it must be brought through the side of the tank, 3 inches below the top (of sides). Overflows shall terminate in a 90 degree elbow not more than 24 inches above the roof.

When the area of a penthouse exceeds 50% of the roof area or when it exceeds an area of 2500 sq. ft., the bottom of the tank shall be required to be not less than 20 ft. above the level of the penthouse roof. In existing standpipe equipment the bottom of the gravity standpipe tank shall not be required to be more than 20 feet above the outlet in the highest story.

   Access to tank. Access to the top of each standpipe tank shall be provided by means of an iron gooseneck ladder of substantial construction and rigid bracing.

(m) High and low alarm and flow tell tale. Every tank used for standpipe fireline purposes shall be provided with either an electric high and low water alarm as defined elsewhere in these rules or with a flow tell tale constructed as provided for elsewhere in these rules, in order that it may be determined at any time whether or not the required standpipe reserve is in the tank, except that where the house water supply is taken from the same tank as the standpipe supply and not from any other tank, neither a high and low alarm or a flow tell tale need be provided when an automatic tank filling pump is installed.

(n) Check valve. There shall be provided in a horizontal run of pipe below the main roof in the line connecting the standpipe tank with the standpipe riser an approved type swing check valve opening toward riser, except that where a siamese steamer connection has been omitted under these rules, no check valve shall be required. An O. S. &amp; Y. gate valve shall be provided on each side of the check valve and shall be sealed open in an approved manner.

(o) Heating of tanks. All tanks used for standpipe supply purposes shall be heated by means of steam supplied through a brass coil with brass fittings and of a type and radiating surface as prescribed by the Board of Standards and Appeals. The heater shall be fed through a 1 1/4-inch steam line with a 1-inch return, separately trapped. The water in the tank shall be maintained at a temperature above 40 F., which condition, if obtained by a variation of the arrangement of coil as may be specified by the Board of Standards and Appeals, will be acceptable. Tanks supplying both standpipe and house service lines in hotels, hospitals and institutes using the tank supply seven days a week shall not require heating. If in an adequately heated enclosure, interior heating of tanks shall not be required.

(p) Suction tanks. Suction tanks shall be of at least 5000 gallons effective water capacity reserved for fire pump use exclusively and shall be constructed of steel or reinforced concrete, located in the cellar, or in the basement or lowest story if there is no cellar under the building. The Fire Commissioner may permit suction tanks to be located in a separate enclosure or building provided they are accessible and in his judgment such location will be more practicable. Suction tanks shall be fed by a connection at least 3 inches in diameter taken direct from the public street main. The supply shall enter the suction tank above the top or through the side near the top of the tank and shall be controlled by a bronze ball cock and copper float.

(q) Pressure tanks. Pressure tanks shall contain the quantities of water as specified for gravity tanks, but in no case may a tank have a capacity in excess of 9,000 gallons. Pressure tanks shall be located in the top story or penthouse and shall be properly protected against freezing. The tank shall be kept two-thirds full of water under a pressure of 30 lbs. per square inch and shall be so located and proportioned that a pressure of not less than 15 lbs. per square inch will be available at the hose outlet in the highest story. The air compressor shall be of sufficient capacity to increase the air pressure at an average of one pound in two minutes in each pressure tank. The connection to riser or risers, the emergency drain and the means of access to tank shall be as required for gravity tank in § 10-03(l). Pressure and water level gauges shall be required. The means of supplying water shall be as required for gravity tanks except that filling must be done without reducing the pressure in the tank.

The method of water supply to tanks, the overflow, the high and low water alarm, the emergency drain, etc., shall be as prescribed for tanks above the roof except that the overflow and emergency drain shall be direct connected to the drainage system of the building. The connection of the tank to the system shall be as hereinafter set forth: Piping of the same diameter as the riser shall connect the tank with the riser of the portion of equipment supplied from that tank and in this connecting line in a horizontal run there shall be placed an approved swing check valve opening downward, and two O. S. &amp; Y. gate valves one at each side of the check valve. Each tank section shall be direct connected to the tank section above by means of piping of the same diameter as that of the largest riser and in this connecting line shall be provided an approved swing check valve opening upward, in order that water pumped into the siamese connection may enter the entire equipment of the building, and that each tank will supply only its portion of the system.

(t) Valves. All valves controlling standpipe water supply except valves at hose outlets shall be iron body brass mounted. Outside Stem &amp; Yoke gate type.

(u) Piping. Materials of Construction: All new piping for standpipe firelines shall be of genuine full weight wrought iron or steel and properly tested by the manufacturer to 500 lbs. per square inch hydrostatic pressure. All pipes shall be lap welded. Where working pressures are in excess of 150 lbs. to the square inch extra heavy cast iron valves and fittings shall be used. The standard weight fittings and valves may be used where the pressure is not more than 150 lbs. per sq. inch. Fittings in horizontal runs shall have long turns. All underground piping shall be of extra heavy cast iron.

(v) Construction. Each standpipe fireline riser shall be supported at the bottom and in every other (alternate) story, and shall be properly braced. Horizontal lines shall be supported by heavy wrought iron hangers attached by straps or bars extending around and over floor beams at intervals of not more than 10 ft., and at more frequent intervals if deemed necessary by the Fire Commissioner and shall be securely braced to withstand vibration. Hangers may be supported by straps or bars extending over and around bars of at least 1 in. in diameter and 12 in. in length embedded in concrete floors parallel to and at least 2 in. from the undersurface or by approved malleable iron concrete inserts. The arrangement of lines must be straight and as direct as practicable. Offsets will be permitted only when unavoidable or where necessary to install horizontal check valves. Where standpipe lines are adjacent to or in close proximity to other pipes of 4 in. or larger diameter, the standpipe firelines shall be coated with red paint. Except where flange fittings and pipes are permitted elsewhere in this rule, all joints shall be screwed joints made up thoroughly water tight with red lead, litharge and glycerin, or compressed graphite lead and boiled linseed oil, or any joint compound that may be approved by the Board of Standards and Appeals. In horizontal runs of piping of standpipe fireline systems, if larger than 4 in. in diameter, fittings and valves may be of the flange type, provided flange races are machined true and smooth and do not show rings, and sand holes or other imperfections. All joints must be either ground or provided with corrugated copper gaskets. All standpipe (fireline) equipments must be installed in a workmanlike manner.

(w) Protection of risers.

Chapter 14: Gas Shut-off Valves
--------------------------------------------------



*§ 14-01 Construction and Installation of Gas Shut-Off Valves.* ::


(a) General. 

   (1) Gas shut-off valves and accessory appliances shall include valves approved as such by the Bureau of Standards, Washington, D.C., by the Underwriters' Laboratories, Inc., Chicago, Ill., by the Associated Factory Mutual Laboratories of Boston, or other recognized standard laboratory; and all valves shall be approved and meet the test prescribed by the Board of Standards and Appeals.

   (2) Gas shut-off valves shall be installed only by corporations, firms or individuals who shall furnish evidence of their qualifications under the Code of Ordinances, to the Fire Commissioner or the Tenement House Commissioner in their respective jurisdictions.

   (3) Such corporations, firms, or individuals shall maintain a service station which shall be in direct communication with the Fire Department by telephone or telegraph. Location of service station and means of communication shall be on file with the Fire Commissioner in order that the Fire Department may insure immediate service when the gas is turned off by the members of the Fire Department or from any other cause. The Fire Department shall have exclusive use of gas shut-off valves to be operated in the event of fire or other emergencies.

   (4) All gas shut-off valves to be installed must be made of the best quality of standard materials.

(b) Protection of valves. 

   (1) The gas shut-off control shall be protected by a suitable, approved metal box placed on the exterior of the building, which shall be connected, through a rigid metal conduit, by a cable, with the valve body placed on the gas intake where the gas pipe enters the building, and as near as practicable to the inside face of the wall, before reaching the meters. The lock for securing box on outside wall of building shall be operative only by a Fire Department inner box key by members of the Fire Department.

   (2) All valve bodies shall be made of brass or bronze. If a spring is used to actuate a valve in conjunction with the fusible link, it shall be of the best quality phosphor bronze.

   (3) The internal mechanism which acts to shut off the gas shall be securely connected with the external mechanism by a direct mechanical connection, made gas tight, where it passes through the valve body, by a stuffing box filled with soft, well-lubricated packing, in accordance with recognized standard practice.

(c) Installation. 

   (1) The valve shall be so installed as to be conspicuously displayed and readily inspected and reset by authorized persons. Valves shall be located so that condensation will not accumulate in the valves; and shall be installed so that gas will flow through the valve in direction indicated on it.

   (2) Valves shall be secured in piping by threaded connections or companion flanges. Combustible packing or sheet lead shall not be used between flanges.

   (3) The gas main at both ends of the valve must be rigid and secure to withstand the pull from the control handle. Additional non-combustible brackets or hangers must be provided, if necessary, to secure and maintain rigid installation.

   (4) The valve shall be enclosed in a substantial, perforated metal case, conspicuously exposed, painted red, protected by standard lock acceptable to the Bureau of Fire Prevention and shall indicate the name, telephone number and address of installer, to insure prompt service to property owner.

   (5) Casing of the valve on gas intake shall be kept locked to protect valve from interference and make it accessible only to authorized persons. Perforations, to allow circulation of air around fusible link, shall be provided and so arranged as to prevent tampering with valve when casing is locked.

(d) Control box. 

   (1) The control handle for the manual closing of the valve shall be in a locked metal control box having a cast iron cover conspicuously labeled with raised letters, painted red.

   (2) On the outside of the cover or the inside of the control box, in raised or stamped letters, or on a securely fastened metal plate, shall be displayed concise operating directions, together with the name, initials or registered trademark of the manufacturer.

   (3) The control box must be placed as nearly vertically above the point where the gas main enters the premises as is practicable, when this does not involve excessive length of cable and extra turns, and at a height above the sidewalk or grade, of not less than two (2) feet and not more than five (5) feet. Without special permission, the control box shall not be placed or mounted on basement window frames, or directly above basement windows or other openings, nor shall it be located behind doors or other obstructions which would prevent the Fire Department from having easy access to it.

   (4) Control boxes must be securely and permanently fastened. Whenever possible, they shall be fastened to a non-combustible wall, pillar or column. They shall be secured by not less than two 3/16 inch bolts or the equivalent. Unless the building is so constructed that the control box must unavoidably be secured to a wooden part, the use of wood screws is not permitted for supporting countersunk control boxes; lag bolts shall be used. When the walls are of masonry or concrete, through bolts, expansion bolts or toggle bolts shall be used. All fastenings must be arranged so that they cannot be loosened except from inside opening of the control box.

   (5) Control boxes may be set or recessed into the wall to a depth not greater than the depth of the box so that cover is flush with the face of the wall. Control boxes may be mounted directly on the surface of the wall.

   (6) The control box shall be located on the outside of the building wall, facing the street, whenever possible. When the control box is installed on an alley face of a building, or in a similar place where the control box is subject to injury from passing vehicles, etc., the control box must be thoroughly protected. This may be done by having the control box recessed, marked by waterproof red paint ring and waterproof white paint ring on the wall, or, when such protection is not available, protected by heavy iron channels or angles secured to the wall by through bolts, expansion bolts, or toggle bolts.

(e) Control handles. Control handles shall be of standard construction, arranged to fit the control boxes so that they may be locked without difficulty, and cable connections shall be securely made in an approved manner, according to the design of the handle.

(f) Cable. 

   (1) The connection between the valve and control handle shall be as direct as practicable, and shall consist of a single piece of standard phosphor bronze cable not less than 3/32 inch in diameter. No splices in the cable shall be permitted.

   (2) It is essential that cable connections to valve and handle be securely made according to the design in each case. The cable may be slightly annealed for making ends, and when cutting the cable, it should be taped and cut through the tape, or a small amount of solder applied where it is to be cut, so as to prevent frayed end.

(g) Conduit. 

   (1) The control cable for the shut-off valve shall be run in galvanized wrought iron or steel pipe or other standard and approved conduit not less than 1/2 inch in pipe size. The pipe or conduit line must be water-tight and continuous from the casing enclosing the operating mechanism of the valve to the control box on outside of building. The cable shall not be exposed at any point in its length.

   (2) All ends of pipe or conduit, not only at valve and control box terminals, but in the run of the piping, shall be carefully reamed so as to remove burrs and fins caused by cutting-off tools, which would interfere with the movement of the cable in the run, or cut, or wear the cable. Unions should not be employed in making joints.

   (3) Pipe or conduit must be rigidly and permanently secured in position. Pipe straps and hangers of standard forms may be employed for this purpose. In every case supports must be provided at points sufficiently numerous to prevent sagging. Pipe straps (if used) must be of metal of sufficient thickness to insure a permanent fastening and must be thoroughly coated to prevent corrosion.

(h) Bends and offsets. 

   (1) Bends of small radius or through much of an arc, introduce possibilities of binding of the cable or of an appreciable friction resisting the pull of the cable: therefore, approved roller fittings shall be required wherever the pipe or conduit is bent to a radius of less than 4 inches, or wherever the bend is through an arc exceeding 15 degrees except as outlined for offsets.

   (2) When connections to control boxes are made from below it is frequently necessary to make an offset in the conduit to avoid a water table or other part of a building wall. One offset of not more than 2 inches will be permitted for each installation at such points. The bends in the pipe forming the offsets must be carefully made to avoid cracking the enamel or galvanized coating or the flattening or cracking of the pipe or conduit. The amount of offset shall not exceed 2 inches and the length of the offset shall not be less than five times the amount of the offset. For example, a 2-inch offset must be at least 10 inches long. Single offsets only shall be permitted. Double offsets are not acceptable.

      (i) Roller fittings. For turns in the conduit greater than those mentioned above, approved roller fittings shall be used. No roller fittings turning more than 90 degrees from a straight line shall be used.

(j) Automatic control.

   (2) To determine whether the valve shuts off tightly under this test, a tube shall be connected with the outlet side of the valve and the outer end of the tube shall be immersed in water to a depth not exceeding one (1) inch, indicating leakage by bubbles rising through the water from the end of this tube.

   (3) Valves, after this test, shall be capable of shutting off ten (10) pounds air pressure applied to the inlet side; to determine whether the valve is tight, the test procedure shall be as indicated in the preceding test.

   (4) Valve bodies shall be strong enough to withstand, without leakage, one hundred (100) pounds pressure applied from either end with the other end closed. In this test the entire valve, including the stuffing box, shall be completely immersed in water, so that leakage will be indicated by bubbles rising through the water.

   (5) The fusible link connections of each valve shall be carefully tested to avoid prematurely operating the gas shut-off valve through vibration or concussion. The construction of the fusible link connections shall be so designed and made that the automatic feature will not operate through vibration or concussion.

   (6) The entire process of manufacture of the valves shall be subject to inspection and review and each valve shall be tested at the factory by a recognized laboratory or agency with facilities for making the test prescribed by the Board of Standards and Appeals, and each valve must bear satisfactory evidence that it has been so tested.

   (7) Manufacturers of gas shut-off valves must submit the name or names of said laboratories or agencies to the Fire Commissioner or the Tenement House Department Commissioner, in their respective jurisdictions, with satisfactory evidence of their ability and facilities to properly carry out said tests.

   (8) Valves and operating mechanism shall be so designed and constructed that they will withstand deteriorating effects or corrosion, as evidenced by operating tests.

(l) Installation and inspection tests. 

   (1) After shut-off valve is installed, it shall be set and operated to determine that proper closure is secured by operating the control handle. Particular care should be taken to observe that when operating the control handle, no part of the cable or of its attachment to the valve interferes in any way with the positive closure of the valve.

   (2) After the above test, all gas outlets in the building must be inspected to insure their being closed before the valve shall be set and the gas turned on. Valve and connections shall also be tested for leaks by applying a solution of soap and water to all parts, including connections to gas piping.

   (3) After the valve has been used to shut off gas, it shall be reset only by authorized corporations, firms or individuals, or by members of the Fire Department.

   (4) Operating and installation corporations, firms or individuals responsible for the installation of the gas shut-off valves shall permanently maintain properly equipped service stations in each of the boroughs where they install valves.

(m) Inspection. Gas shut-off valves and installations shall be inspected at least once a year by members of the Fire Department or the Tenement House Department, in their respective jurisdictions, or by corporations, firms or individuals authorized to install gas shut-off valves, as determined by the Fire Commissioner or the Tenement House Department Commissioner, in their respective jurisdictions.

      (iv) Each of the specimens shall be bent in a jig having a working contour shown in Figure 7 and otherwise substantially in accordance with that figure. Any convenient means may be used for moving the plunger member with relation to the die member. The specimens shall be placed on the die member of the jig with the weld at mid-span. One of the specimens removed from the 3/8 inch groove welded material shall be placed with the face of the weld directed toward the gap, the other with the root of the weld directed toward the gap. Both specimens removed from the 1 inch groove-welded material shall be placed with that side showing the greater defects, if any, directed toward the gap. Both fillet welded specimens shall be placed with the root of the weld directed toward the gap. The two members of the jig shall be forced together until the curvature of the specimen is such that a 1/32 inch diameter wire cannot be passed between the curved portion of the plunger member and the specimen. The specimen shall then be removed from the jig.

      (v) The convex surface of each specimen tested shall be examined for the appearance of cracks or other open defects. Any specimen in which a crack or other open defect is present after bending, exceeding 1/8 inch measured in any direction, shall be considered as having failed. Cracks occurring on the corners of the specimen during testing shall not be considered unless there is definite evidence that they result from slag inclusions or other internal defects.

      (vi) In the foregoing tests, base material and filler metal, conforming to the specifications listed in § 25-01(h), in an amount adequate to provide for the removal of the required specimens shall be provided. A minimum of 1 1/8 inches from the end of each test weld shall be discarded before removing the test specimens. All welds shall conform to the general requirements of good workmanship and the particular practices set forth in § 25-01(g).

      (vii) Welder qualification tests shall be manual shielded metal-arc welding, using base material conforming to ASTM A36-67 and filler metal conforming to AWS Group Designation F 4 using ASTM E70XX, low hydrogen electrodes.

(j) Supervision and inspection. 

   (1) Any welding to be done on a structure or any part thereof shall be performed under the observation of a representative of a standard testing agency or an inspection agency responsible to the owner or registered architect or licensed professional engineer. Such agency shall qualify by written examination in order to be certified by the Commissioner of Buildings.

      (i) The Commissioner of Buildings may, in the case of minor welding operations, including stairs and fire escapes, waive the requirements for inspection by a testing agency or inspection agency, if in his judgment such inspection may be adequately made by an inspector of welding employed regularly in the Department of Buildings.

      (ii) Each welding inspector shall have three years experience in the field of welding and/or welding inspection in order to be certified by the Commissioner of Buildings and he shall be issued an identification card which shall be displayed upon request by the representative of the Dept. of Buildings. Welding inspectors shall have in their possession welding gauges for visual inspection.

   (2) The agency as provided for in § 25-01(j)(1) shall take adequate means to assure that the preparing, oxygen cutting, assembling and welding of the joints of the structure conform to the design and that the resulting structure is free from deficiencies and injurious defects. He shall keep and submit daily to the registered architect or licensed professional engineer responsible for the work and to the Building Commissioner adequate records of the progress of the work, of difficulties experienced, and of his decision of acceptance and rejection. His records shall allocate a definite and personal responsibility for his acceptance of every weld as to size, location, type of filler metal used and quality of workmanship, and shall evidence that no weld called for in the design has been omitted. He shall require that each welder place his identification symbol on his work, and the inspector after inspecting each weld shall do likewise.

      (i) He shall inspect for defects and irregularities, plate cracks adjacent to or behind welds, crater cracks or cracks in the weld metal.

      (ii) He shall gauge all welds for deficiency of throat or other critical cross-section.

      (iii) He shall carefully observe and reject unallowable or out of tolerance undercutting, overlap or lack of fusion at edges of weld, lack of penetration, or porosity, location of craters, size and shape of bead, and order occasional chipping to determine penetration and correct all or any irregularities of workmanship contrary to the design.

      (iv) He shall maintain a staff of inspectors numerous enough to provide one inspector for every twelve welders on each job at all times provided that the welders are within five tiers of each other.

   (3) The contractor who is to do welding shall be approved by the Borough Superintendent. He shall submit to the Borough Superintendent a statement that the work will be done in accordance with these rules and the Administrative Code and shall include in such statement, the detailed procedure he proposes to follow, which shall include the following: That each welder or group of welders shall be under the continual supervision of an experienced foreman. That only welders qualified under these rules be employed. Each welder shall exhibit, when required, his Certificate of Qualification. That each welding foreman shall be provided with proper gauges to check his work. That the foreman shall be able to read blueprints and shall lay out and allocate the work each welder is to perform and he shall carefully observe the burn-off of the electrode; the fusion, and penetration of crater; the formation of the bead; and the sound of the arc. That only the base metal and filler metal conforming to the job specifications and these rules be used. That the welding equipment furnished shall have proper characteristics to allow good work. That whenever deemed necessary by the Borough Superintendent, such tests of the finished welds, shall be made as required by him.

   (4) Daily inspection shall be made of preheating equipment to see that it is functioning properly. Preheat drying cabinets for low hydrogen electrodes shall be maintained within easy access of all welding operators. Above information to be included in daily welding inspectors reports.

   (5) Before equipment used to supply welding current is used at the job site, it shall be tested at job site by the testing laboratory responsible for the welding to ascertain proper functioning of equipment and to establish the arc voltage and current produced by this equipment. This certification shall be filed with the welding report.

(k) Workmanship on welded structures &amp; testing. 

   (1) The quality of welds permitted under this title shall conform to the requirements of Section 2, Design of Welded Connections – of AWS D1.0-66 – Code for Welding in Building Construction and addenda dated September 1967, of the American Welding Society.

   (2) The arrangement of the joints to be welded shall be such as to enable the welder to have an unobstructed view of the surfaces to be welded at all times during the welding operation.

   (3) Welds found deficient in dimensions, but not in quality may be enlarged by additional welding. Where a deficient weld renders the weld inaccessible, or has caused new conditions which would make reinforcement dangerous or ineffectual, the weld shall be removed and original conditions restored or in lieu thereof a revised design, correcting this condition, shall be submitted to the Borough Superintendent. In removing defective parts of a weld, the gouging, chipping or grinding, shall not extend into the base metal any substantial amount beyond the depth of weld penetration unless cracks or other defects exist in the base metal.

   (4) All complete-penetration butt welds, except when produced with the aid of a backing or welded from both sides in square edge material not more than 5/16 inch thick with root opening not less than one-half the thickness of the thinner part joint, shall have the root of the initial layer gouged or chipped out on the back side before welding is started from that side. Butt welds made with the use of a backing of the same material as the base metal shall have the weld metal thoroughly fused with the backing. Backing strips may be removed by pneumatic chipping or carbon arc gouging, after welding is completed, provided the weld surface is left flush or slightly convex with full throat thickness.

   (5) To insure soundness, the ends of butt welds carrying stresses approaching the maximum allowable working stress shall be extended past the edges of the parts joined, by means of short extension bars providing a similar joint preparation and having a width not less than the thickness of the thicker part joined. If extension bars are removed upon completion of the weld, the ends of the weld shall be smooth and flush with the edges of the abutting parts. Where the metal is not more than 3/4 inch in thickness, the extension bars may be omitted if the ends of the butt weld are chipped or cut down to solid metal, and side welds are applied to fill out the ends to the same reinforcement as the faces of the weld.

   (6) Tack welds located where the final welds will later be made shall be subject to the same quality requirements as the final welds. Where tack welds are encountered in the final welding, they shall be cleaned and fused thoroughly with the final weld. Defective, cracked or broken tack welds shall be removed before final welding.

   (7) Surfaces to be welded shall be free from mill scale, rust, paint or other foreign matter. A thin coat of linseed oil or its equivalent over the surfaces to be welded need not be removed. These provisions shall apply to new structures and where new steel is to be welded to steel in any existing structure. Structural steel shall not be painted on any areas where shop or field welding is to be performed except that a coat of linseed oil without pigment may be used for temporary protection. However, structural members which have been painted, may be welded, provided that the paint is completely removed from the areas to be welded. Parts which are welded in the shop, to be erected by bolts or rivets, shall receive the usual painting if any is required after the shop welding is finished. Parts to be field welded shall receive a coat of linseed oil after shop work is completed, and after erection and field welding, they shall be given two coats of acceptable metal protection of painting as required.

   (8) Where rivets are under load there shall be no welding at the connections between structural members so riveted unless precautions are taken to prevent loss of tension of rivet in a manner approved by the Borough Superintendent.

   (9) In assembling and during welding the component parts of a built up member shall be held by sufficient clamps or other adequate means shall be employed for temporarily fastening the members together and bracing the framework until the joints are welded. This shall consist of erection bolts or positive devices imparting sufficient strength and stiffness to resist all temporary weights and lateral forces, including wind. For all welded structures, erection bolts, or equivalent means shall be employed for temporarily supporting the members, and existing loads, and for insuring proper alignment. The temporary support of girders carrying columns or other heavy loads shall be made rigid by such means as shall be designed by the registered architect or licensed professional engineer in charge and approved by the Borough Superintendent. In tier building erection, members shall not be erected more than two tiers, or more than one-column length above any column connections yet unwelded unless adequate temporary connections are provided.

   (10) The welder shall be protected by adequate covering against high winds, rain, snow or sleet. Where there is an accumulation of water, ice or snow in the joint to be welded, same shall be removed and the joint made dry before welding. No welding shall be done when the temperature of the base metal is below O°F. At temperatures between 32° and O°F. the surface of all areas within three inches of the point where a weld is to be started shall be heated to a temperature specified in the Administrative Code.

   (11) Non-destructive testing equipment.

      (i) Non-Destructive Systems, methods and techniques for testing shop and field welds may be used on condition that all such systems, methods, techniques and apparatus shall first be approved by the Board. Such systems may use x-ray, radiography, magnetic particle, ultrasonic, dye penetrants, etc.

      (ii) The results of actual performance tests by each system for which approval is sought shall be the criteria determining the limitations under which approvals shall be granted.

      (iii) Each system of testing shall prove its unfailing ability to distinguish between good and faulty welds, by testing at least two samples of every class, size and type of weld, for which approval is sought. These weld samples shall be tested under conditions duplicating the conditions met in actual practice, such as:

         (A) Shop welds or field welds or both.

         (B) For field welds the test samples shall be temporarily installed in the most inaccessible parts of a structure where welding is to be tested.

         (C) Flat, vertical or overhead positions.

         (D) Maximum sizes (throats) of welds for which approval is sought.

         (E) Types and alloys of base metals, for which approval is sought.

      (iv) Two or more test samples for each type of weld shall be tested, of which one shall be a perfect weld, and at least one other shall include a flaw or imperfection, deliberately produced in the weld, by lack of penetration, inclusion of slag from the last pass, or such other flaws as the Board shall specify.

      (v) After the designation and rating of each weld sample, by the apparatus under test, the samples with flaws shall be machine cut apart, through the throat of the weld, then polished and etched with acid to disclose the weld with the flaw. The samples with perfect welds shall be tested to failure by tension.

      (vi) The Board shall determine the sizes, types and number of the samples to be tested, and shall decide which test results shall be acceptable for the approval of the method and type of apparatus under test and what limitations, if any, shall be included in any Resolution of Approval.

(l) Metal chimneys, tanks, stairs and fire-escapes. Metal chimneys, tanks, stairs and fire-escapes and all material entering into their construction, when welded, shall conform to these rules. Stairs and fire-escapes shall be considered as light structural steel and where shop welded, shall have attached thereto a tag or label, affixed by the standard Testing Agency, to the effect that these rules have been complied with.

(m) Welding symbols. To provide for uniformity when plans are filed with the Borough Superintendent, welding shall be designated by symbols as given in Figure 9.

(n) The Board of Examiners for welders. 

   (1) The Board of Examiners for Welders shall be appointed by the Commissioner of Buildings from members of the staff of the department. All welders' licenses issued shall be uniform for the five boroughs and shall be issued in accordance with § 25-01(o).

   (2) Welders to be licensed. No person shall perform welding work on any structural members of a structure without having obtained a welder's license from the Board of Examiners for Welders except as provided in § 25-01(n)(3).

      (i) Before a welder's license may be issued authorizing a person to perform welding work on a structural member of a structure the person applying for such certificate shall have been qualified as provided in § 27-616(b)(1).

      (ii) The Commissioner of Buildings may revoke or suspend a license of any person if workmanship on any structural welding is such as to indicate incompetency or negligence which might endanger a structure or result in injury to human beings.

      (iii) Renewal of a license may be made without additional requalification test if the applicant of record indicates one month of satisfactory welding experience during the previous year.
