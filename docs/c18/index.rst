(d) Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Department may deny a petition for a revocable consent without a hearing if, in the sole judgment of the Commissioner, the grant of such consent would interfere with the use of the inalienable property of the City (including streets and sidewalks) for public purpose or would otherwise not be in the best interest of the City.

(e) The revocable consent agreement shall be filed by the Department with the appropriate County Clerk.






*§ 7-10 Annual Rate Schedule for Revocable Consent Improvements.* ::


For all improvements that do not have an annual rate set forth in 34 RCNY § 7-04(a), the annual rate of compensation for the first year of the term of each revocable consent shall be calculated in accordance with the following:

(a) Definitions and variables.

   "A" means the maximum area of the improvement for which a consent has been or is proposed to be granted, as projected onto a horizontal plane (the "footprint").

   "Benefited Property" means the real property which is adjacent to the improvement for which a revocable consent has been or is proposed to be granted, and which is benefited by the improvement.

   "C" means 100 percent plus the percent change (plus or minus) in the Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers in New York and New Jersey published by the U.S. Department of Labor's Bureau of Labor Statistics ("CPI") on July 1 of the year for which the revocable consent annual rate is being calculated, compared to the CPI on July 1, 2003.

   "E" means the standard escalating factor, which shall be a percentage equal to the average annual percentage increase in the CPI for the ten years immediately preceding the year for which the standard escalating factor is being determined; the Department shall determine the standard escalating factor on July 1 of the year to be applied to all consents granted or renewed between that July 1 and the next succeeding June 30, inclusive.

   "L" means the Current Transitional Assessed Value or the Actual Assessed Value, whichever is lower, of the Benefited Property, in its unimproved state (in dollars and cents per square foot); provided, however, that if there is more than one Benefited Property, "L" shall be equal to the average of the Current Transitional Assessed Values of all the Benefited Properties in their unimproved states (in dollars and cents per square foot). Note: For cables contained within conduit owned by another entity, L=0.

   "M" means the applicable multiplier. For pipes and conduits with up to 25 square feet in cross-sectional area, the applicable multiplier is 0.04. For all other improvements, the applicable multiplier is 0.08.

   "Minimum Annual Charge" shall be assessed as follows: For improvements having a maximum cross-sectional area greater than four square feet, the Minimum Annual Charge shall be $3,000. For improvements having a maximum cross-sectional area of four square feet or less, the Minimum Annual Charge is $1,500, except that pipes and conduits having an outside diameter of three inches or less (inclusive of any protective sheath or casing) shall be assessed a Minimum Annual Charge of $750.

   "R1" means the rate of compensation for the first year of the revocable consent agreement which shall be determined in accordance with 34 RCNY § 7-10(b), below.

   "V" means the rate (in dollars and cents) obtained from Table A relating to the volume occupied by the improvement. For improvements exceeding nine feet in height, the computation will be made in units up to nine feet in height and then added together.

(b) Rate for first year. R1 shall equal C[;V + (L × M × A)];, or the Minimum Annual Charge, whichever is greater.

(c) Rate for each subsequent year.

   second year = R1 + (E × R1)    third year = R1 + (2E × R1)   fourth year = R1 + (3E × R1)   fifth year = R1 + (4E × R1)   sixth year = R1 + (5E × R1)   seventh year = R1 + (6E × R1)   eighth year = R1 + (7E × R1)   ninth year = R1 + (8E × R1)   tenth year = R1 + (9E × R1)

(d)  Consents granted on or prior to June 30, 1991. For those consents granted on or before June 30, 1991 which provide for annual fees to be computed based upon the rate schedule currently in effect, annual compensation shall equal R1 as calculated pursuant to 34 RCNY § 7-10(b).

(e) Revenue. All revocable consent revenue shall be collected by the Department.

Chapter 8: Employee Commute Options Program
--------------------------------------------------



*§ 8-01 Background and Authority.* ::


Section 182(d)(1)(B) of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990, 42 U.S.C. § 7511(a)(d)(1)(B), requires states with severe or extreme nonattainment areas for ozone to revise their state implementation plans by adopting new regulations to reduce work-related vehicle trips and miles traveled by employees. The New York State Consolidated Metropolitan Statistical Area, which includes New York City was designated by the Federal Environmental Protection Agency ("EPA") as a severe ozone nonattainment area, 40 C.F.R. § 81.333. Section 14(31) of the New York State Transportation Law authorizes the State Department of Transportation to promulgate rules and regulations to implement the requirements of § 182(d)(1)(B) of the Clean Air Act Amendments and to establish an employee commute options ("ECO") program. The state rules require employers of one hundred or more employees at work locations within severe ozone nonattainment areas in New York State to develop and implement employee trip reduction programs and to make a good faith effort to achieve a twenty-five percent increase in average vehicle occupancy for commuting trips by November 15, 1996. The state transportation law and the rules promulgated pursuant to it also delegate the local administration of the program to counties in the severe ozone nonattainment areas and pursuant to such delegation, the New York City Department of Transportation ("the Department") has been designated the local administrative agency.






*§ 8-02 Applicability.* ::


This chapter shall apply to any affected employer in the City of New York who is subject to the ECO rules of the New York State Department of Transportation, codified at 17 NYCRR Part 38. This chapter shall apply with respect to any and all affected worksites. Pursuant to 17 NYCRR § 38.4(b)(3), the counties of New York (Region 1) and Bronx, Kings, Queens, and Richmond (Region 2) shall be consolidated into a single region consisting of the subregions identified in table one below.






*§ 8-03 Definitions.* ::


For purposes of ECO, the definitions set forth in 17 NYCRR Part 38 shall apply; provided, however, that in this chapter, "Commissioner" shall mean the Commissioner of the New York City Department of Transportation and "Department" shall mean the New York City Department of Transportation.






*§ 8-04 AVO Subregions.* ::


The Average Vehicle Occupancy ("AVO") subregions established pursuant to 17 NYCRR Part 38.4(c) are specified in table one below.






*§ 8-05 Target APOs.* ::


The specific target Average Passenger Occupancy ("APO") for each subregion is specified in Table one below.

AVO AND TARGET APO METHODOLOGIES

ESTABLISHING AVO VALUES

The 1994 AVO values were established by applying the methodolgy mandated by the New York State Dept. of Transportation Employee Commute Options Regulations. These Regulations require the use of United States Census Journey-to-Work data for 1980 and 1990 to estimate the number of employees and the number of vehicles used to get to work in 1994. The method consists of subtracting 1980 total workers from 1990 total workers, and dividing the result by the number of years (ten, in this case), thereby yielding an "annual change." This "annual change" then is used to project the number of employees for 1994 by adding the "annual change" multiplied by the number of years (four, in this case) to 1990 total workers.

A comparable process is used to estimate the number of vehicles used to get to work. The projected number of workers in 1994 then is divided by the projected number of commuter vehicles in 1994 to establish the 1994 AVO. It is important to note that these projected numbers are not intended to represent actual employment or vehicle numbers for 1994, but are solely for the purpose of establishing an AVO.

ESTABLISHING TARGET APOs

Target APOs are also derived following the methodology mandated by the New York State Regulations. The target APO for the region equals the regional AVO multiplied by 1.25. Reaching the APO target is equivalent to reducing the number of vehicles to the "permitted" number. The "permitted number" of vehicles equals the number of employees at all worksites with 100 or more employees, divided by the target APO. We are required to calculate the number of "permitted" vehicles in order to determine whether achieving Target APOs for all the subregions taken together would reduce the number of commuter vehicles to the level required to meet the APO Target for the region.

Target APOs for each subregion were established by increasing the AVO for each subregion by between 10 and 25%.
