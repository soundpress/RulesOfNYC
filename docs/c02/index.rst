Title 3: Fire Department
===================================================

Chapter 1: Administration
--------------------------------------------------



*§ 102-01 Pre-Existing Facilities and Conditions.* ::


(a) Scope. This section consolidates requirements for conditions that were lawfully existing on the effective date of a Fire Code provision, and that, in accordance with FC 102.3 or 102.4, may be continued in compliance with laws, rules, regulations and permit conditions applicable at the time such condition was lawfully allowed or approved.

(b) Definitions. The following term shall, for the purposes of this section and as used elsewhere in the rules, have the meaning shown herein:

   Pre-existing (facility or condition). Any condition, including the design and installation of any facility, lawfully existing on the effective date of a Fire Code provision that, in accordance with FC 102.3 or 102.4 and this rule, may be continued in compliance with laws, rules, regulations and permit conditions applicable at the time such facility was lawfully allowed or approved, and which is not determined by the Department to be subject to the provisions of FC102.5.

(c) Types of Pre-Existing Conditions. The Fire Code was originally enacted effective July 1, 2008. It has been amended since its original enactment. Pre-existing conditions include facilities:

   (1) pre-dating the Fire Code that were lawfully designed and installed in accordance with the New York City Fire Prevention Code and/or other laws, rules, regulations, permit conditions and national standards in effect prior to July 1, 2008; and

   (2) lawfully designed and installed in accordance with the applicable provisions of the Fire Code and rules in effect on and after July 1, 2008, but which could no longer be designed and installed in the same manner as a result of a subsequent amendment to the Fire Code or rules that prohibits, or amends the requirements for, such facility. Pre-existing conditions do not include facilities that were designed under prior laws, rules or repealed or amended Fire Code provisions, if the facility is allowed or would be approved under the Fire Code, as subsequently amended.

(d) Illustrative Pre-Existing Conditions. The following facilities illustrate the application of FC 102.3 and FC102.4:

   (1) Conditions or facilities approved prior to July 1, 2008 that are pre-existing facilities. Approved facilities lawfully existing on June 30, 2008, may be pre-existing facilities under provisions of law that were in effect on that date but repealed effective July 1, 2008, or laws that had been repealed before June 30, 2008, where the facility was lawfully continued until that date. For example:

      (A) A below-grade storage facility for flammable liquids lawfully designed and installed in a mercantile establishment prior to July 1, 2008, and that on June 30, 2008 was in compliance with the design and installation requirements for such facilities set forth in Subchapter 9 of the New York City Fire Prevention Code , is a pre-existing facility which may be continued in compliance with the provisions of the New York City Fire Prevention Code and the rules in effect on June 30, 2008, notwithstanding the fact that such below-grade facility would not be allowed or approved in a control area under the Fire Code.

      (B) A refrigerating system that was lawfully designed and installed on a premises pursuant to Subchapter 18 of the New York City Fire Prevention Code prior to the enactment of the 1968 Building Code, and that had not been required by reason of alteration or otherwise to be replaced to comply with the superseding 1968 Building Code or subsequent construction code requirements for such systems, may be continued in compliance with the earlier provisions of the New York City Fire Prevention Code, notwithstanding the fact that such refrigerating system would not be allowed or approved under the Fire Code.

      (C) An LPG storage facility that was lawfully designed and installed on a premises pursuant to Fire Prevention Directive 2-88, and that had not been required by reason of alteration or otherwise to be replaced or discontinued, may be continued in compliance with said directive, notwithstanding the fact that the quantity of LPG storage authorized by said directive exceeds the quantity that would be allowed or approved under the Fire Code.

   (2) Conditions or facilities not approved prior to July 1, 2008 that are pre-existing facilities. Any condition or facility lawfully existing on July 1, 2008, that had not been regulated under the New York City Fire Prevention Code or New York City Building Code prior to such date, and which are not allowed and could not be approved under the Fire Code or the rules, may be a pre-existing condition or facility within the meaning of this section, if:

      (A) prior to June 30, 2008 or other effective date of the applicable Fire Code provision, the condition or facility was in compliance with the requirements of any applicable Federal, New York State or other laws, rules or regulations; and

      (B) at the time the condition or facility was established, it was substantially in compliance with national or industry standards or practices.

   (3) Conditions or facilities lawfully existing prior to July 1, 2008 that were not pre-existing facilities but become pre-existing facilities as a result of subsequent Fire Code amendments. Any condition or facility which was lawfully existing on June 30, 2008, and which was allowed or approved under the Fire Code may become a pre-existing facility by a Fire Code amendment or rule that no longer allows or authorizes approval of the condition or facility. For example:

      (A) An existing underground liquid motor fuel storage tank designed and installed after April 2000 pursuant to provisions of Subchapters 8, 9 and 11 of the New York City Fire Prevention Code and former 3 RCNY § 21-20 that are substantively identical to the provisions of the Fire Code and the rules, was not a pre-existing facility within the meaning of former FC 102.3 and this section and was required to comply with the applicable provisions of the Fire Code and the rules. However, effective March 30, 2014, the Fire Code's design and installation requirements for underground liquid motor fuel storage and dispensing systems were amended. As a result, an underground liquid motor fuel storage tank designed and installed in accordance with these former Fire Prevention Code and rule provisions would not be allowed or approved under the Fire Code. Accordingly, such an underground liquid motor fuel storage tank, which was not previously a pre-existing facility, became a pre-existing facility pursuant to FC 102.3 and 102.4 on March 30, 2014, provided that, on March 29, 2014, its design and installation remained in compliance with the design and installation requirements under which it was originally approved or allowed.

   (4) Conditions or facilities designed or installed under the Fire Code  that are pre-existing facilities. Any condition or facility designed and installed on or after July 1, 2008, pursuant to provisions of the Fire Code, or which was not regulated by the Fire Code between July 1, 2008 and the date of a Fire Code amendment, may be a pre-existing facility if the condition or facility was lawfully existing on the day prior to the effective date of an amendment of the Fire Code. For example:

      (A) A fire apparatus access road dead end turnaround designed and installed in compliance with the Fire Code requirements for such turnarounds in effect prior to March 30, 2014 (as set forth in former FC503.2.5), and lawfully continued until March 29, 2014, is a pre-existing facility that may be continued in compliance with the laws, rules, regulations and permit conditions applicable at the time such turnaround was lawfully allowed or approved, notwithstanding the fact that the turnaround would not be allowed or approved under the amended Fire Code, which increased the required size of the turnaround.

      (B) A below-grade paint spray booth designed and installed in compliance with the Fire Code requirements for paint spray booths in effect prior to March 30, 2014 , and lawfully continued until March 30, 2014, is a pre-existing facility which may be continued in compliance with the laws, rules, regulations and permit conditions applicable at the time such paint spray booth was lawfully allowed or approved, notwithstanding the fact that such below-grade paint spray booth would not be allowed or approved under the amended Fire Code, which prohibited below-grade paint spray booths.

(e) Consolidation of Provisions of Law Applicable to Pre-Existing Facilities and Conditions. Provisions of the New York City Fire Prevention Code and the rules in effect prior to the enactment of the Fire Code effective July 1, 2008, and provisions of the Fire Code and the rules in effect prior to the amendment of the Fire Code effective March 30, 2014, including requirements governing the design and installation of pre-existing facilities, and the manufacturing, storage, handling and use of materials in pre-existing facilities under conditions that would not be allowed or approved under the Fire Code, are consolidated in Chapter 48 of the rules, as follows:

   (1) The third and fourth characters of the number of each section of Chapter 48 of the rules correlate to the Fire Code chapter with that number. For example, R4809-01 refers to pre-existing fire protection systems, which are governed by FC Chapter 9. The provisions of law consolidated in each such section are those applicable to pre-existing facilities and conditions relating to a material or facility governed by that Fire Code chapter.

   (2) The provisions of law consolidated in each such section have been abridged to delete operational and maintenance requirements, or design and installation requirements that are allowed or approved under the Fire Code, as to which compliance with the Fire Code is required. Deletions are indicated by asterisks (***).

   (3) Any amendments to the provisions of law consolidated in each such section are indicated by underlining, and, if terms defined in the Fire Code or rules are used, by italics.

(f) Other Provisions of Law Applicable to Pre-Existing Facilities and Conditions. Pre-existing facilities and conditions shall comply with all applicable laws, rules and regulations, including provisions of law not consolidated in 3 RCNY Chapter 48.

*§ 109-01 FDNY Summons, Certification of Correction and Stipulation Procedures.* ::


(a) Scope. This section sets forth procedures for the certification of correction and adjudication of violations issued by the Department and returnable to the New York City Office of Administrative Trials and Hearings (OATH).

(b) Definitions. The following terms shall, for the purposes of this section and as used elsewhere in the rules, have the meanings shown herein:

   FDNY summons. A form, formerly known as a notice of violation, that is used for purposes of enforcing the Fire Code, the rules, or other law, rule or regulation enforced by the Department, that serves to notify the respondent named therein of a violation of such laws, rules or regulations, orders correction of same, commences a proceeding at OATH, and sets forth information relating to such violation and proceeding.

   OATH. The New York City Office of Administrative Trials and Hearings, acting pursuant to Section 1049-a of the New York City Charter.

(c) Certification of Correction of Violations.

   (1) All FDNY summonses, except those that charge failure to certify correction, false certification or violation of a Commissioner's order (other than the order to certify correction), shall include an order requiring the respondent to correct the conditions constituting the violations, and to file a certification with the Department that the conditions have been corrected.

   (2) The required certification shall be made on the certificate of correction form accompanying the FDNY summons issued by the Department representative. The certificate of correction shall be completed and signed by the respondent in accordance with the instructions set forth thereon, and shall be notarized by a notary public or commissioner of deeds. The respondent shall submit with the certificate of correction all documentation necessary and appropriate to demonstrate correction of the violations.

   (3) The signed and notarized certificate of correction shall be directed to:

      Administrative Enforcement Unit      Bureau of Legal Affairs      New York City Fire Department      9 MetroTech Center      Brooklyn, NY 11201-3857

   (4) The certificate of correction must be received by the Administrative Enforcement Unit of the Bureau of Legal Affairs no later than the close of business on the 35th calendar day from the date of offense set forth on the FDNY summons. Both the date of offense and the date for certification of correction are indicated on the face of the violation.

   (5) The filing of a certificate of correction in accordance with this section constitutes an admission to the offense charged and results in a finding of liability, but respondents cited for one (1) or more first offenses who, for each such condition, timely correct and file a certificate of correction that is accepted by the Department, are not required to appear for a hearing at OATH and avoid the imposition of a penalty on such violation.

   (6) When more than one (1) violation of a law, rule or regulation is cited on the same FDNY summons, the respondent may certify correction as to one (1) or more of such violations. However, respondent must appear for a hearing at OATH, as set forth on the FDNY summons, if certification of correction is not filed with and accepted by the Department for all of the violations cited on the FDNY summons.

   (7) The Department will review all certificates of correction and determine whether to accept them as satisfactory certification of correction. The Department will notify each respondent as to whether the certificate has been accepted, and, if it has not been accepted, advise the respondent of the deficiencies in the certification and the actions and/or proof required to correct the violations.

(d) Acceptance of Compliance Stipulations in Adjudications.

   (1) If the respondent admits to the violation but requires additional time to comply beyond the date indicated on the FDNY summons, the respondent may request a stipulation for compliance purposes.

   (2) The Department may agree to offer a stipulation to extend the time for correction, upon such terms and conditions as the Department determines to be reasonable. Such offer, and the finalization of any such stipulation, shall be consistent with 48 RCNY Chapter 3.

*§ 109-03 Penalty Schedule for FDNY Summonses.* ::


(a) Scope. This section establishes a penalty schedule for violations of the laws, rules and regulations enforced by the Department, cited by Department personnel in FDNY Summonses returnable to OATH for adjudication. This penalty schedule is not applicable to violations returnable to, or adjudicated by, any other forum.

(b) Penalty Schedule. The penalty schedule, annexed hereto as Appendix A, sets forth six (6) types of penalties, three for first violations and three for second and subsequent violations.

   (1) First violation penalty. This penalty will be applied to the first violation committed by the respondent, provided that the respondent appears at OATH in response to the violation. Violations for which the respondent timely certifies correction (in the manner and by the date specified on the FDNY Summons, in accordance with Administrative Code § 15-230 and R109-01) and the Department accepts proof of correction, do not require an appearance by either party and are not subject to civil penalty.

   (2) First violation mitigated penalty. This reduced penalty will be applied to a first violation, provided that the respondent appears at OATH in response to the violation and establishes that the violating condition has been corrected on or before the hearing date set forth on the FDNY Summons.

   (3) First violation maximum penalty. This is the maximum penalty provided by law for a first violation. It will be imposed when the respondent defaults on the violation or otherwise fails to appear or respond to a violation.

   (4) Second/subsequent violation penalty. This penalty will be applied to the second and each subsequent violation committed by the same respondent, for the same provision of law, rule, regulation or Violation Category within 18 months of the first violation, as set forth in Administrative Code § 15-229(a), provided that the respondent appears at OATH in response to the violation. All second and subsequent violations require an appearance and are subject to penalty. Special provisions apply to FDNY Summons for unnecessary and unwarranted alarms, as set forth in R907-01.

   (5) Second/subsequent violation mitigated penalty. This reduced penalty will be applied to a second and each subsequent violation, provided that the respondent appears at OATH in response to the violation and establishes that the violating condition has been corrected prior to the hearing.

   (6) Second/subsequent violation maximum penalty. This is the maximum penalty provided by law for a second and each subsequent violation. It will be imposed when the respondent defaults on the violation or otherwise fails to appear or respond to a second or subsequent violation.

   (7) Penalties for Administrative Code violations. The penalty schedule also sets forth penalties for violations of Administrative Code §§ 15-220.1 and 231 and FC1404.1. There is no mitigated penalty for such violations.

   (5) Within one (1) year of obtaining a certificate of completion, apply for and receive a passing grade on the Department's practical (on-site) examination at the work locations in which the applicant is to serve as an FLS director. An applicant who has received a certificate of completion may perform the duties of a FLS director on an interim basis (as set forth in R113-02(f)(6)), pending administration of the practical (on-site) examination.

(e) Registration of Work Locations. The FLS director certificate of fitness must be registered for each work location at which the holder of such certificate will be performing the duties of a FLS director. A FLS director certificate of fitness authorizes the holder of such certificate to perform such duties only at those work locations registered with the Department and at no other work location.

   (1) Limitation on work locations. An FLS director certificate of fitness may be registered by the Department for one (1) or two (2) work locations. Special approval is required to register for more than two (2) work locations, and shall only be granted upon a determination that the holder is capable of demonstrating and maintaining proficiency at each work location.

Such letter shall be on business letterhead, and signed by an appropriate principal or officer of the employer, and provide such information and documentation as may be required by the Department.

   (3) Practical (on-site) examinations. The Department will administer, at the time of application, a separate practical (on-site) examination for a second work location that an FLS director certificate of fitness applicant or holder seeks to register, and each additional work location for which special approval is required from the Department in accordance with R113-02(e)(1). The Department may require the holder to submit to an additional practical (on-site) examination at time of renewal of the certificate, or such other time as the Department may specify, upon a determination that such examination is necessary to demonstrate the holder's continuing qualifications and fitness to serve as an FLS director in more than one work location. The Department may give priority to first-time applicants in the scheduling of practical (on-site) examinations.

   (4) Change in work location. A change in work location must be immediately reported to the Licensing Unit of the Bureau of Fire Prevention, and application made for a practical (on-site) examination at the new work location prior to commencing work at such location.

   (5) Certificate not in use. The certificate of fitness of an FLS director who has no work location registered with the Department shall be deemed "Not In Use" (inactive) and is not valid to perform the duties of an FLS director. An FLS director certificate of fitness that is in "Not In Use" status may be renewed only once.

(f) Transition to FLS Director from Fire Safety Director and Fire Safety/EAP Director.

   (1) Transition timeframe. Effective March 1, 2020, an FLS director certificate of fitness or, as set forth in R113-02(f)(6), a certificate of completion allowing the applicant to perform the duties of an FLS director on an interim basis, will be required in all occupancies currently required to be staffed by a fire safety/EAP director or fire safety director. Fire safety/EAP director certificates of fitness and fire safety director certificates of fitness will not satisfy the Fire Code requirement for an FLS director and will not be renewed upon expiration.

   (2) Application for FLS director certification. All persons holding a fire safety director or fire safety/EAP director certificate of fitness must apply to the Department for an FLS director certificate of fitness no later than December 1, 2018, or the expiration of their certificate of fitness, whichever is sooner. An FLS director certificate of fitness will be issued to each such person who possesses and demonstrates to the satisfaction of the Department the qualifications set forth in R113-02(f)(3) or (4), as applicable. A person who, without good cause, fails to timely fulfill the requirements for the FLS director certificate of fitness may be required to submit an original application for such certificate of fitness.

   (3) Transition requirements for fire safety/EAP directors. Not later than September 4, 2017, or the expiration of the certificate of fitness, whichever is sooner, all persons holding a fire safety/EAP director certificate of fitness must attend and successfully complete a training course accredited by the Department pursuant to R113-04 and R113-06 that addresses active shooter and medical emergencies.

   (4) Transition requirements for fire safety directors. All persons holding a fire safety director certificate of fitness but not an EAP director certificate of fitness shall undertake and successfully complete the following requirements.

      (A) Not later than September 4, 2017, or the expiration of their certificate of fitness, whichever is sooner, attend and successfully complete a training course accredited by the Department pursuant to R113-04 and R113-06 that addresses active shooter and medical emergencies, which may be a training course in non-fire emergencies accredited pursuant to R113-04 and R113-05 that includes training in active shooter and medical emergencies;

      (B) Not later than September 3, 2018, or the expiration of their certificate of fitness, whichever is sooner, attend and successfully complete a training course accredited by the Department pursuant to R113-04 and R113-05 that addresses non-fire emergencies generally (commonly referred to as Emergency Action Plan training);

      (C) Not later than December 1, 2018, or the expiration of their certificate of fitness, whichever is sooner, apply to the Department for an FLS director certificate of fitness;

      (D) Not later than March 1, 2019, receive a passing grade on the non-fire emergency component of the Department's written examination. (Employment or the promise of employment as an FLS director in a particular building is not required to take such examination.) Upon receiving a passing grade on the non-fire emergency component of the written examination, the Department will issue a certificate of completion. An applicant who has received a certificate of completion may serve as an FLS director on an interim basis, as set forth in R113-02(f)(6), pending administration of the practical (on-site) examination; and

      (E) Not later than one year from obtaining a certificate of completion, apply for and receive a passing grade on the Department's practical (on-site) examination at the work location in which the applicant is to serve as an FLS director.

   (5) Transition requirements for certificates not in use. Any person holding a fire safety director or fire safety/EAP director certificate of fitness that is in "not in use" status must timely complete the transition requirements applicable to the FLS director certificate of fitness, as set forth in R113-02(f)(3) or (4), as applicable, or its "not in use" status will lapse on December 1, 2018, or the expiration of their certificate of fitness, whichever is sooner.

   (6) Interim FLS directors. When an applicant for an FLS director certificate of fitness is to be employed in a work location that has not yet obtained Department acceptance of its comprehensive fire safety/EAP plan, such applicant may, upon receiving a certificate of completion, perform the duties of an FLS director on an interim basis pending administration of the practical (on-site) examination for a period not to exceed one (1) year from the date of issuance of the certificate of completion or for such other period of time as the Department may grant in its discretion. The presence on the premises of a person holding such a certificate of completion satisfies the requirement for an FLS director during such interim period, as set forth in R113-02(d)(5) and (f)(4). "Perform the duties of an FLS director on an interim basis" means that such person is authorized to implement the provisions of FC Chapter 4 and R404-01 with respect to fire emergencies and to take such actions in response to non-fire emergencies as the owner may authorize, based on the non-fire emergency plan or procedures currently in place.

*§ 4604-01 Compensation for Operation of Auxiliary Fire Alarm Systems (effective July 1, 2009).* ::


(a) Scope. This section sets forth the compensation required to be paid to the City of New York pursuant to Administrative Code § 15-127(a)(1) by a central station company or a proprietary central station, as those terms are defined in R901-02(b), for operation of an auxiliary fire alarm system.

(b) Definition. The following term shall, for purposes of this section and used elsewhere in the rules, have the meanings shown herein:

   Auxiliary Fire Alarm System. The re-transmission or other reporting to the Department of alarm signals from the monitoring of fire alarm systems by a central station company, proprietary central station, or any other person or company that receives compensation or derives any other financial benefit therefrom.

(c) Required Compensation. Each central station company shall pay to the Department, on an annual basis, or such other basis as the Department may require or authorize, its proportionate share of the cost associated with its use of the Department's fire alarm communications system, as calculated in accordance with the provisions of this section.

(d) Computation of Compensation.

   (1) The Department will calculate, not less frequently than on an annual basis, the compensation each central station company is required to remit to the Department, in accordance with the computation set forth in this subdivision.

   (2) Compensation shall be based on the costs of operating the Department's communications offices for the preceding fiscal year, allocated according to the number of fire alarm systems monitored by each central station company as of July 1st of the preceding fiscal year, and the volume of central station company alarm traffic generated by each central station company in the preceding fiscal year.

   (3) Step One: Calculation of Total Central Station Company Cost. This amount will be calculated as follows:

      (A) the total alarm traffic handled by the Department's communications offices is calculated for the preceding fiscal year;

      (B) the alarm traffic generated by all central station companies ("total central station alarm traffic") is calculated as a percentage of the total alarm traffic for the preceding fiscal year; and

      (C) the total cost of operating the Department's communications offices is calculated for the preceding fiscal year ("total operating cost") and is multiplied by the percentage representing the total central station alarm traffic in the preceding fiscal year, to obtain the cost attributable to the total central station alarm traffic for the preceding fiscal year ("total central station cost").

   (4) Step Two: Calculation of Individual Central Station Compensation Amounts. These amounts will be calculated as follows:

      (A) the total number of fire alarm systems monitored by central station companies as of July 1st of the preceding fiscal year, and the number of fire alarm systems monitored by each central station company as of such date, are tabulated, and the percentage of the total number of monitored fire alarm systems is calculated for each central station company ("alarm system allocation");

      (B) the total central station alarm traffic generated by each central station company is separately tabulated for the preceding fiscal year, and each central station company's percentage of the total central station alarm traffic is calculated ("alarm traffic allocation");

      (C) the two percentages representing the alarm system and alarm traffic allocations are averaged (added together and divided by two) to obtain a single combined percentage for each central station company ("total allocation"); and

      (D) each central station company is charged the percentage representing its total allocation of the total central station cost for the preceding fiscal year.

(e) Billing and Payment.

   (1) The Department will bill each central station company on or about October 1st for the coming year, or such other date as the Department may designate.

   (2) Each central station company shall remit payment in full no later than 60 days of receipt of the invoice.

   (3) Any central station company that fails to timely remit payment shall additionally be liable to the Department for interest on the compensation due and owing to the Department. Such interest shall be computed for the period from the date of the bill to the date of payment, based on the amount of the bill and the rate of interest set forth in Section 5004 of the New York Civil Practice Law and Rules. Such interest shall constitute part of the compensation required by this section.
