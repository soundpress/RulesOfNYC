Title 63: Landmarks Preservation Commission
===================================================

Chapter 1: Practice and Procedure--Public Hearings and Meetings of the Commission
--------------------------------------------------



*§ 1-01 Quorum.* ::


A quorum of the Landmarks Preservation Commission shall consist of six Commissioners. Public hearings and public meetings may be conducted without a quorum.






*§ 1-02 Calendaring.* ::


The Landmarks Preservation Commission may, upon the adoption of a motion, calendar an item to be considered for landmark designation. A motion to calendar must be approved by the majority of the Commissioners present in order to be adopted. The date of the public hearing on the proposed designation may be set by the motion to calendar or it may be set at some later time by the Chairman, acting at his or her discretion.






*§ 1-03 Withdrawing and Laying Over Certificate of Appropriateness Items.* ::


Once an application has been included on a Certificate of Appropriateness public hearing calendar, it may be withdrawn or laid-over as follows:

(a) Lay-Overs (requests prior to being heard). If an application has been included on a Certificate of Appropriateness calendar and the hearing has not yet occurred, the applicant may request that the application be laid-over to a subsequent public hearing. The applicant must send the Landmarks Preservation Commission a letter indicating that he or she would prefer to be heard on a subsequent hearing and stating that the Commission's time to act on the matter is being extended for an equivalent length of time. Upon receipt of this request staff will withdraw the item and hold it for the following month's hearing. Where the application concerns, in whole or in part, the legalization or curing of a violation, the applicant shall be allowed to lay over the item only once as of right. If the applicant requests a subsequent lay-over, the Chair may at his or her own discretion consider the request a request for withdrawal and may withdraw the item pursuant to the procedure set forth in subsection (b)(1) of this section, or, if the application seeks to legalize a violation, the Chair may keep the item on the calendar and the Commission may act on it at the public hearing. Withdrawal of an application to legalize or cure a violation, in whole or in part, shall be deemed a dissapproval for purposes of service of a second or subsequent notice of violation pursuant to Administrative Code § 25-317.1b(4)(a)(ii).

(b) Withdrawals (requests prior to being heard). If an application has been included on a Certificate of Appropriateness public hearing calendar and the hearing has not yet occurred, the application may be withdrawn from the calendar as follows:

   (1) by the applicant if the applicant sends a letter to the Landmarks Preservation Commission indicating that he or she wishes to abandon the application as proposed. Staff withdraws the item and generates the "Withdrawn at Staff Level" number from "Permit Application Tracking System", a withdrawal letter is sent to the applicant and the application is closed.

   (2) by the staff if new information or design modifications are provided that enable the staff to issue a staff-level permit. Staff withdraws the item from the calendar and issues a staff permit to close the application.

   (3) by the staff at the direction of the Director of Preservation if the status of the application changes with respect to scope and completeness.

(c) Withdrawals from calendar (after having been heard). If an application has been included on a Certificate of Appropriateness public hearing calendar and the hearing has taken place, the application can only be withdrawn by the applicant if he or she sends a letter to the Landmarks Preservation Commission indicating that the application is being abandoned as proposed. Upon receipt of this request staff will withdraw the item from the calendar, generate a "Withdrawn at Staff Level" number from "Permit Application Tracing System" and send the applicant a withdrawal letter to close the application. Where the application concerns, in whole or in part, the legalization of a violation, the Chair may, at his or her own discretion, reject the applicant's request to withdraw and the Commission may continue to consider and act on the application as submitted. Withdrawal of an application to legalize or cure a violation, in whole or in part, shall be deemed a dissapproval for purposes of service of a second or subsequent notice of violation pursuant to Administrative Code § 25-317.1b(4)(a)(ii).






*§ 1-04 Final Actions.* ::


No final determination or action will be made or taken except by concurring vote of at least six Commissioners.






*§ 1-05 Submissions to the Record.* ::


The Commission may, upon the adoption of a motion, close the hearing and leave the Record open on a particular item until a stated date to allow for the submission of additional written information. Submissions received after the stated date will be included in the Record provided they are received prior to the Commission's determination or action on the item. The Commission will neither make a final determination nor take any final action on an item while the Record is open on that item.




Chapter 2: Alteration of Landmark and Historic District Buildings
--------------------------------------------------




**Subchapter A: Application Procedure**



*§ 2-01 Application Signatures Necessary for Work Permits.* ::


All application forms to perform any work on a designated landmark or on a property in a designated historic district must be signed by the owner of the property. An application for work on or in a cooperative building must be signed by the President or other appropriate officer of the Co-op Board. The signature of the managing agent of the cooperative building is not sufficient. An application for work on or in the areas and portions of a condominium building in common ownership must be signed by the President or other appropriate officer of the Condominium Association. An application for work on or in an individual condominium unit must be signed by the owner of that unit.






*§ 2-02 Master Plans and Authorizations to Proceed.* ::


An owner of a designated property may apply for approval of a master plan when the proposal involves repetitive alteration of architectural features (such as windows, through-wall air conditioning installations, storefronts, etc.) and when those alterations are not planned to occur all at once, but rather in increments through time. A master plan can be approved by a Certificate of Appropriateness or by a Permit for Minor Work depending on the work which it covers. In both cases the master plan sets a standard for future changes involving the architectural features in question and specifically identifies drawings and other documents which contain the approved design in detail. Once a master plan is approved and the owner wishes to move forward with a portion of the work covered by the master plan, a completed application form is filed with the Commission describing the scope of work (for example: 8 front windows on the 12th floor) and stating that the work will conform to the approved master plan drawings and other documents on file with the Landmarks Preservation Commission. The staff of the Preservation Department will review the application to ascertain that all proposed work is covered by a master plan, and will send the owner an "Authorization to Proceed" letter allowing the work to proceed. The Authorization to Proceed is sent prior to the commencement of the work and is contingent on adherence to the approved master plan drawings.






*§ 2-03 Process for Completing Application: Staff Withdrawal of the Application.* ::


(a)  All applications for work on designated properties received by the Landmarks Preservation Commission are assigned to a professional staff member in the Preservation Department who will handle the project. The staff person will review the proposal to ascertain whether the materials submitted are sufficient for a determination to be made. If the materials are sufficient, staff will certify the application as complete and issue the appropriate permit or take other action. If the completed application requires a Certificate of Appropriateness, staff will arrange for the item to be included in the next scheduled Certificate of Appropriateness public hearing calendar. If the application requires further clarification and/or additional documentary materials, staff will contact the owner and/or applicant by telephone to discuss the proposal and, if necessary, arrange a meeting or site visit. Staff will follow the conversation up by providing a materials checklist calling out those supplementary materials required to certify the application as complete. If contact has been limited to a telephone conversation, the checklist will be mailed to the applicant. If a meeting is set up, the checklist may be supplied during the course of the meeting. As soon as all the materials requested have been received, staff will certify the application as complete and process the application. However, if the required materials have not been received 60 working days from the date on the materials checklist, staff will send a follow-up letter to the applicant reminding him/her that the application is still incomplete and informing him/her that unless the materials required are received within the next 30 working days the application will be deemed withdrawn. A copy of the most recent materials checklist will be included with the letter. If the applicant does not submit sufficient material within 90 days of the date on the materials checklist, staff should withdraw the application by sending a staff withdrawal letter including the docket number of the application and a "Withdrawn at Staff Level" number generated by "Permit Application Training System". The application will then be closed. The staff withdrawal letter will be sent to the owner and applicant with copies forwarded to the file, supervisor, and the Director of Preservation. Along with the withdrawal letter a blank "Application for Work on Designated Properties" will be included for the use of the applicant should he or she wish to re-apply.

(b) Notwithstanding the time periods set forth in subdivision (a), where an application seeks to legalize or cure a violation, an applicant must submit all materials required by the materials checklist within 20 working days of the date of the materials checklist. If the materials are not submitted, the staff shall send a follow-up letter that shall inform the applicant that the application may be withdrawn by the staff unless all required materials are submitted within 15 working days of the date of the follow-up letter. If the applicant fails to submit all required materials within 55 working days of the date of the first materials checklist, the staff may withdraw the application as set forth in subdivision (a). Withdrawal of an application to legalize or cure a violation, in whole or in part, shall be deemed a disapproval for purposes of service of a second or subsequent notice of violation pursuant to Administrative Code § 25-317.1b(4)(a)(ii).






*§ 2-04 Notices of Violation – New Applications.* ::


The Landmarks Preservation Commission will not process an application for work on a designated property when an Landmarks Preservation Commission Notice of Violation is in effect against that property. A Notice of Violation in effect against that property indicates non-compliance with the Landmarks Law.

(a) Upon receipt of an application, staff must verify that no Notice of Violation is in effect against the property. In the event that a Notice of Violation is in effect, staff should proceed as follows: Obtain copies of all Notices of Violation and Notices to Stop Work for the file. Contact the owner/applicant to inform them that because a Notice(s) of Violation is (are) in effect staff cannot process an application for new work until the Notice(s) has (have) been rescinded. Send a letter to the applicant explaining that staff cannot process the new application because a Notice(s) of Violation is(are) in effect against the property, that processing can only commence upon rescission of the Notice(s) or when the applicant begins to address the Notice(s). Along with the letter send copies of the Notice(s), an application form, and instructions for filing. Send copies of the letter to the Director of Preservation, Supervisor, and the Director of Enforcement.

(b) Exceptions to this procedure. Staff may issue permits for new work when a Notice of Violation is in effect in the following instances:

   (1) The proposed work will correct a hazardous condition.

   (2) The proposed work addresses the prevention of deterioration affecting the building, and the work will clearly further the continuing preservation of the building.

   (3) A permit has been issued to correct work cited in a Notice of Violation, and an escrow agreement or other acceptable form of assurance has been established to provide a mechanism, acceptable to the Landmarks Preservation Commission, that ensures that the work approved under the permit to correct the Notice of Violation will be completed within a specified time period.







**Subchapter B: Specific Alterations**



*§ 2-11 Installation of Heating, Ventilating and Air Conditioning Equipment.* ::


(a)  Introduction. These rules are issued to assist the public in applying to the Landmarks Preservation Commission for approval of the installation of heating, ventilation and air conditioning equipment in buildings which are designated landmarks or are within designated historic districts. These rules enunciate Commission policy with respect to such installation and also explain the procedures required to apply for a permit. The visual character of the exterior wall cladding, the pattern of window openings on the facades, and the ornamental elements used to articulate the exterior walls are important and integral parts of the design of buildings. In most historic buildings, these three elements were carefully combined to help define the style and character of the building. It is important to retain the visual integrity of the exterior walls, the regular pattern of the window bays, and the ornamental elements. Therefore, the Commission, in making a determination on proposed installations of window, through-wall or roof- or yard-mounted HVAC equipment, evaluates the effect of the proposal on the aesthetic, historical and architectural values and significance of the landmark or of the building in an historic district. The Commission considers, among other matters, the architectural style of the building and the design, finish, material, method of installation and color of the proposed work. These rules are based on the following principles:

   (1) The distinguishing historical qualities or character of a building's structure or site and its environment should not be destroyed. The removal or alteration of any distinguishing architectural feature should be avoided.

   (2) The visual integrity of the building's exterior walls should be maintained. The goal of these rules is to facilitate the approval of appropriate HVAC installations in landmarked buildings. Certain installations can be approved at staff level in conformance with the procedures and criteria set forth in these rules. Proposed installations that do not conform to these rules require a Certificate of Appropriateness review by the full Commission in accordance with the Landmarks Law. Applicants are strongly encouraged to develop building master plans for the installation of HVAC equipment.

*§ 2-12 Rules for Installation of Awnings.* ::


(a)  Introduction. These rules are issued to assist building owners in applying to the Landmarks Preservation Commission ("Commission") for approval to install or repair awnings. The rules set forth Commission policy with respect to such installation and repair and explain the procedures and criteria required to apply for and receive a permit from the staff of the Commission. The goal of these rules is to facilitate the approval of appropriate awnings for designated buildings. Certain awning repairs and installations can be approved at staff level in conformance with the procedures and criteria set forth in these rules. Proposed installations or alterations that do not conform to these rules require a certificate of appropriateness review by the full Commission in accordance with the procedures and criteria set forth in §§ 25-305, 25-307 and 25-308 of the New York City Administrative Code. These rules are based on the following principles:

   (1) Awnings were historically employed for weather protection above residential windows and doors and for advertising as well as weather protection above storefronts.

   (2) The location of awnings historically corresponded to the size and shape of the openings they covered, and awnings were installed directly above the wall openings they covered.

   (3) Removal or damage of any significant feature is to be avoided in connection with the installation of awnings. Applicants are encouraged to submit applications for master plans, pursuant to § 2-02 of Title 63 of these Rules, for commercial portions of buildings with multiple storefronts or for residential buildings, which will permit the installation of awnings over a period of time in a single building or building complex.

If retractable, the awning shall have a straight or curved slope and may or may not have side panels. Retractable awnings may follow the curved configuration of the window or door openings over which they are installed. If a display window or doorway opening has an arched or segmental head, the awning must be retractable if it is installed at the head of the window, but may be fixed if it is installed at the rectilinear transom bar. Both retractable and fixed awnings may or may not have a skirt. Awning skirts must be unframed. The skirt height shall be proportional to the height and size of the awning.

   (2) The attachment of the awning will not cause the loss of, damage to, or hide or obscure any significant feature.

   (3) The awning shall be installed at or directly below the lintel or transom bar, except that the awning may be attached up to eight inches above the lintel where:

      (i) a roll-down security gate that either was present at the time of designation or was previously approved by the Commission makes it impossible to install the awning at the lintel or transom bar; or

      (ii) installing the awning at the lintel or transom bar will result in the lowest framed portion of the awning being less than eight feet above the sidewalk. Where the awning is installed above the lintel, the awning encroachment above the lintel shall be the minimum required to accommodate the conditions described above in subparagraphs (i) and (ii) and in no instance shall exceed eight inches.

   (4) In cases where the storefront itself projects from the facade, the awning must be attached to the projecting storefront below the storefront cornice or cap.

   (5) The length of the awning shall not exceed the length of the storefront opening or the associated window opening, and the edges of the awning shall be aligned as closely as possible with the inside face of the principal piers of the storefront, or the window opening.

   (6) The underside of the awning shall be open.

   (7) The lowest framed portion of the awning shall be at least 8 feet above the sidewalk. The lowest unframed portion shall be at least 7 feet above the sidewalk.

   (8) The awning shall project at an angle and be of a length, size and slope which are proportional to the size and height of the window or door.

   (9) The awning shall be clad only with water repellant canvas with a matte finish or other fabric of a similar appearance.

   (10) Signs, such as lettering or graphics, are permitted to be painted on the awning skirt only; no lettering or graphics shall be permitted on the sloped portion of the awning. The size of lettering shall be proportional to the height of the awning skirt.

   (11) Awning fabric shall consist of a solid color or vertical stripes that harmonize with the historic color palette of the building.

(g) Applicability. The provisions of this section shall not apply to proposals to install awnings:

   (1) On buildings subject to a building or district master plan, or other special rule approved by the Commission, governing the installation and characteristics of an awning; and

   (2) On buildings, including historic modifications thereof, that did not originally or historically have awnings, including without limitation thereof public and institutional buildings such as houses of worship, schools, post offices and fire houses. Where the LPC staff reasonably believes that a building did not originally or historically have an awning, the LPC staff shall, at the applicant's request, calendar the proposal for a certificate of appropriateness public hearing. The applicant may request a meeting with the Director of Preservation or, in his or her absence, the Deputy Director, to discuss the LPC staff's interpretation of these rules.






*§ 2-13 Removal of Fire Escapes.* ::


The following will clarify instances in which staff may issue a Certificate of No Effect (CNE) for the removal of fire escapes from designated buildings. The removal of a fire escape requires either a CNE or a Certificate of Appropriateness (C of A). If the fire escape is a significant protected feature, then a C of A is required to approve its removal. However, staff may issue a CNE for a fire escape removal if it determines:

(a) that the fire escape is not a significant protected feature on the building based on the finding that:

   (1) the fire escape is not original to the building, and

   (2) the fire escape does not have architectural merit in itself, and

   (3) the fire escape is not mentioned in the LPC designation report, and

   (4) the building with the fire escape is not located within an historic district in which fire escapes are significant architectural elements that contribute to the special architectural and historic character for which that historic district was designated.

(b) That any damage to the facade will be repaired to match the adjacent fabric (patching any holes would be invisible enough to have "no effect" on the significant protected feature of the building);

(c) that the removal of the fire escape will not leave gaps, holes, or unsightly conditions on the facade. Occasionally, the installation of a fire escape requires the removal of architectural elements or portions of architectural elements (e.g. cornices). If the applicant is not prepared to remedy these conditions in connection with the removal of the fire escape, staff will have to make a judgment as to whether or not it would be desirable to allow the removal. If the applicant is willing to make restorative repairs, staff will have to decide whether these would require a Permit for Minor Work (PMW) or a C of A. It would be inappropriate to include these restorative repairs on a CNE since obviously they would have an effect on the significant protected features of the building. If the level of restoration requires a C of A, a CNE should not be issued for the removal, but rather the removal should be calendared for a public hearing with the restoration.






*§ 2-14 Sandstone Restoration and Replacement.* ::


The staff may issue a Permit for Minor Work for the restoration or replacement of sandstone/ brownstone elements and the following guidelines should be used in evaluating such proposals.

(a) For buildings that have especially fine ornament or distinctive or unique carvings where damage is minimal, the staff may issue a Permit for Minor Work for an application to consolidate the original significant fabric.

(b) For buildings where the decorative features are simple, not necessarily unique, stoops with damage to the treads or other kinds of damage to the facade, the staff may issue a Permit for Minor Work for an application to remove the original sandstone surfaces and replace them with a cementitious mix. In reviewing the application, the staff should find that:

   (1) documentation or site inspection reveals that the existing brownstone surface is exfoliating, damaged or otherwise unsound;

   (2) the proposal calls for the replication of the original texture, color, profiles and details;

   (3) the proposal calls for damaged stone to be cut back to sound stone and the new surface be keyed into the sound stone and built up in successive layers using a cementitious mix with the top layer tinted and finished to match the original sandstone texture and color. In some cases a sample patch should be requested for inspection and approval. The use of wire lath is never acceptable;

   (4) the methods and materials proposed by contractors have been provided in the form of specifications, copies of contracts, or written in a letter.






*§ 2-15 New Window Openings.* ::


Staff is authorized to issue a Certificate of No Effect for new window openings and sash when the following conditions are met:

(a) Visible window openings on secondary façades:

   (1) the new window opening(s) and sash retain the same general shape and pattern as existing windows on the same façade, or, where there are no existing window openings, the new window opening will be located in a place and be of a size and shape where it can form the basis for a regular and consistent pattern;

   (2) the new sash will match the configuration and finish of the historic, predominant window sash on the secondary façade. If there is no such existing sash, the new sash will match the configuration and finish of, or not detract from, the window sash on the front façade;

   (3) the location of new window openings is consistent and regular and that the number, size or placement of the new window openings does not change the character of the façade as a secondary and subservient façade with a high solid to void ratio. For row houses or townhouses, staff may approve no more than one new window opening for every 20 linear feet of secondary façade per floor; existing window openings on such façade shall be counted in determining how many new window openings may be approved for each floor; and

   (4) new window opening and sash do not detract from the significant architectural features of the building or adjacent buildings by virtue of their proximity to such features.

(b) For nonvisible or minimally visible window openings on secondary facades:

   (1) the proposed window opening does not alter or destroy other protected features, nor does the proposed window opening or sash detract from such protected features by their proximity to such features.

   (2) For purposes of this subsection (b), a new window opening shall mean (i) a window opening where none previously existed or (ii) a combination of two or more horizontally adjacent windows, provided such adjacent windows are, or will be once all of the approved work is complete, located in the same room. In addition to being combined, such horizontally adjacent windows may be enlarged in height by up to 10 percent of the height of the largest existing window opening being combined.

   (3) For purposes of § 2-15(b), the term "minimally visible" shall mean that the proposed window opening and sash are only partially visible from a public thoroughfare and that the window opening and sash are visible from such an angle and/or such a distance that they do not call attention to themselves and do not detract from the significant architectural features of the building or historic district.

(c) For purposes of this § 2-15, the term "secondary facade" shall mean a facade that does not face a public thoroughfare or mews or court and that does not possess significant architectural features.






*§ 2-16 Rear Yard Additions or Enlargements to Row Houses in Historic Districts.* ::


Staff may issue a Certificate of No Effect (CNE) for a rear yard addition to, or enlargement of, a row house in a historic district if the project meets the following criteria:

(a) the rear of the building has no significant architectural features (such as corbelled brickwork, decorative lintels or sills, and projecting bays) that would be lost or damaged as a result of the construction of the addition;

(b) the proposed addition or enlargement will not extend to the rear lot line or substantially eliminate the presence of a rear yard;

(c) a majority of the other buildings in the block feature comparable or larger rear yard additions or enlargements in terms of their projection into the rear yard;

(d) the proposed addition or enlargement does not rise to the full height of the building and is not taller than the predominant height of existing additions or enlargements in the block;

(e) the rear façade will not be removed from the entire width of the building. Instead, existing openings will be modified to provide access into the addition;

(f) the rear of the building retains the scale and character of an individual rowhouse;

(g) the proposed addition or enlargement is not visible from a public thoroughfare or right of way;

(h) the proposed work complies with the Zoning Resolution and will not require a special permit or variance; and

(i) the building does not already have a grandfathered rooftop addition or enlargement, a rooftop addition or enlargement approved by the staff pursuant to section 2-19 of this chapter, or a rooftop addition or enlargement approved by the Commission.






*§ 2-17 Restoration of a Building and Building Facade Features.* ::


(a)  Introduction. These rules are issued to assist building owners in applying to the Landmarks Preservation Commission for approval of applications to undertake the restoration of a building element or group of building elements on a designated property. The rules set out Commission policy with respect to such work. The goal of these rules is to facilitate and expedite the approval of restoration work proposed for designated properties. Proposed restoration work that does not conform to these rules requires a Certificate of Appropriateness review by the full Commission in accordance with the Landmarks Law.

(b) Definitions. As used in these Rules, the following terms have the following meanings:

"Awning" means a metal frame clad with fabric attached over a storefront, door or window.

"Bulkhead" means the part of the storefront that forms a base for one or more display windows.

The glazing in the transom may be fixed or operable. Terms not otherwise defined in these rules shall have the meanings given them in the Landmarks Law.

(c) Restoration work. The LPC staff will issue a Certificate of No Effect or a Permit for Minor Work for the restoration of building facade(s) or individual facade element(s) (including but not limited to roofs and cornices, stoops, storefronts, window and door openings, window and door enframements, ironwork, porches and siding) to their original or historic appearance if the staff determines that the proposed restorative work satisfies the following conditions:

   (1) The restoration would not cause the removal of significant historic fabric (such as Victorian period features on an earlier structure) that may have been added over time, which is evidence of the history and development of a building, structure, or site, and the authenticity of the restoration is documented by:

i. Photographic evidence, or

ii. Physical evidence on the building, or

iii. Original or historic drawings or documents, or

iv. Matching buildings.

   (2) Except for work that is subject to paragraph (3) below, if there is no available documentary evidence as set forth in subdivisions (i)-(iv) of paragraph (1) of this section and the applicant certifies that he or she (or a designated representative) has searched for historic drawings, documents or photographs at the resources listed in Appendix A of chapter 2 of this Title, the design may be based on that found in buildings of similar age and style that contain stylistic elements that follow a set pattern or type.

   (3) For new storefront infill where no significant historic fabric exists:

i. The design of the infill must be based on the criteria in subparagraphs (i-iv) of paragraph (1) of this subdivision, or on historic storefront prototypes and details within the specific historic district for buildings of similar age, type and style, and;

A. The configuration of replacement infill must be consistent with the proportions of display windows, transoms (if necessary given the size of the display windows) and bulkheads of historic storefront infill. For purposes of this subdivision, proportion refers to the dimensional arrangement of the historic components and details in relation to each other, the storefront opening and the size of the building; and

B. Storefront framing must feature a molding profile that recalls the articulation of historic storefront framing; and

C. The placement of the bulkhead, display window and transom must maintain the building street wall; and

E. Recessed entrances may have either splayed or straight returns; and

F. Entrances, including doors, recesses and steps leading up to the storefront infill, may be modified to accommodate barrier free access, as long as the design intent of the new, original or historic storefront is maintained. Steps or entryways containing cast iron vault lights may not be modified, except that one tread and riser may be removed to accommodate barrier free access if the tread is reinstalled flush at the entry; and

G. If the building was constructed prior to the 20th Century, the material of the new infill must match the historic infill; for buildings constructed after 1900, the material of the new infill may be wood or metal or match the historic material; and

H. New storefront infill must have a finish that recalls the finish of historic storefronts; and

I. No interior partitions may be closer than eighteen (18) inches to the glass of the display window; and

J. If original or historic piers have been previously removed, the design must include the reintroduction of piers that recall the location, size, and dimension of such piers; and

K. If the original storefront opening has been reduced in size the design must include restoration of the original size of the opening. If interior conditions preclude restoration to the original size, the storefront opening must be enlarged to the greatest extent feasible and the storefront surround must be consistent with the materials and details of the historic base of the building; and

L. If the applicant is proposing to remove modern cladding on the storefront or the area surrounding the storefront, the applicant must first perform probes of the material to see if historic material or elements exist behind the modern cladding. If significant historic storefront infill exists underneath the cladding the owner must restore the historic material and the new storefront can only be approved pursuant to paragraph (1) above. If a significant portion of the historic storefront surround exists underneath the cladding, but no historic storefront infill remains, the storefront surround must be restored as part of the application for new storefront infill under this paragraph (3); and

M. If the building contains multiple storefronts, and the provisions of subparagraph (ii)(B) below do not apply, the first storefront approved under this paragraph (3) shall be the model for all subsequent storefronts in terms of matching the piers, proportions of elements of storefront infill and finish, but allowing for minor variations in detail and finish. Notwithstanding the provisions of this subparagraph, a new storefront approved under paragraph (1) of this Section may be approved.

ii. The provisions of this paragraph (3) do not apply in the following situations:

A. To individual landmarks or storefronts subject to the following district master plans: Proposed Alterations and new Construction of Storefronts in the Jackson Heights Historic District, Stone Street Historic District Master Plan, District Master Plan for Storefronts on Madison Avenue in the Upper East Side Historic District, District Master Plan for Storefronts on Madison Avenue in the Metropolitan Museum Historic District, District Master Plan for Storefronts on Madison Avenue in the Carnegie Hill (and Extension) Historic District.

B. If the building contains multiple storefronts and at least one of the storefronts contains most of its historic elements, a new storefront must match the historic design, except that the entrance may be modified to accommodate barrier free access as permitted by clause (F) of subparagraph (i) of this paragraph.

C. If there is a Warning Letter or Notice of Violation against the property for the removal of a storefront without permits and the storefront that was removed was in significant part an original or historic storefront, only the provisions of paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subdivision will apply to the design of the storefront, except that the entrance may be modified to accommodate barrier free access pursuant to clause (E) of subparagraph (i) of this paragraph.

   (4) Awnings, Security Gates and Grilles, and Storefront Air Conditioning Units and Grilles for new storefronts approved pursuant to paragraphs (1), (2) and (3) above.

i. Awnings, Signage and Lighting. The design and installation of awnings, signage and lighting must conform to the criteria set forth in Title 63 of RCNY, Sections 2-12 and 2-20.

ii. Security Gates. Staff may approve an application for security gates and grilles on proposed storefronts if:

A. The security gate is open mesh where it covers glazed areas of the storefront; and

B. The security gate is located behind the storefront infill; or

C. the roll-down security gate is mounted on the exterior of the storefront, it is installed so that the gate rolls down on the exterior side of the display window and door and:

1. the installation does not affect, obscure or damage historic fabric;

2. the security gate housing is located on the interior of the storefront, or the outer face of the security gate housing is recessed so as not to protrude beyond the storefront framing; and

3. the security gate tracks are recessed or set into reveals along the sides of the storefront.

Chapter 3: Repair and Replacement of Windows In Landmark and Historic District Buildings (Window Guidelines)
--------------------------------------------------



*§ 3-01 Introduction.* ::


(a) These rules are issued to assist the public in applying to the Landmarks Preservation Commission for approval of repair, rehabilitation, restoration or replacement of windows in buildings that are designated landmarks or are within designated historic districts. These rules, which hereinafter will be referred to as "guidelines," enunciate Commission policy with respect to such repair, rehabilitation, restoration or replacement and also explain the procedures required to apply for a permit.

(b) Windows are an important and integral part of the design of most buildings. They typically comprise 30% to 40% of the surface area of a building's principal facade. In most historic buildings the window sash, window framing, and the architectural detail surrounding windows were carefully designed as an integral component of the style, scale and character of the building. It is important to retain the configuration, operation, details, material and finish of the original window as well as to maintain the size of openings, sills, decorative moldings, and the sash itself.

(c) Therefore, the Commission, in making a determination on proposed repair, rehabilitation, restoration or replacement of windows, evaluates the effect of the proposal on the aesthetic, historical and architectural values and significance of the landmark or of the building in an historic district. The Commission considers, among other matters, the architectural style of the building and the design, texture, material and color of the proposed work.

(d) These window guidelines are based on the following principles:

   (1) The distinguishing original qualities or character of a building's structure, or site and its environment, should not be destroyed. The removal or alteration of any distinctive architectural feature should be avoided whenever possible.

   (2) Deteriorated architectural features including windows should be repaired rather than replaced whenever possible.

   (3) If replacement is necessary, the new window should match the original or historic window in design and other visual qualities. 






*§ 3-02 Repairs, Rehabilitation and Restoration.* ::


(a) Repairs. Deteriorated windows can often be repaired and made sound and fully operational. A permit is not required to undertake ordinary repairs including:

   (1) Replacement of broken glass, together with replacement of associated moldings, muntins and glazing compound with material of matching characteristics.

   (2) Scraping, priming and repainting of window sash and/or frame to recoat with same color and finish that exist at the time such work is undertaken.

   (3) Caulking around frames and sill.

   (4) Repair and replacement of window hardware, including pulley chains.

   (5) Installation of weatherstripping.

   (6) Straightening of metal window members.

   (7) Rebuilding of portions of sills, sash and other window members, using the same material and to the same configuration, size and shape, limited to the following:

      (i) up to 100% for sills, bottom sash rails and parting strips;

      (ii) up to 40%, measured separately, for trim, moldings and other sash members.

   (8) Consolidating wood members.

(b) Rehabilitation and restoration. A permit is required for:

   (1) work that does not meet the requirements of subsection (a) above;

   (2) changes in configuration; or

   (3) any change in the shape or size of any member.






*§ 3-03 Storm Windows.* ::


(a) The installation of secondary glazing units ("storm windows"), either interior or exterior, will be allowed under the following conditions:

   (1) A permit is not required for installation of interior storm windows provided that:

      (i) The installation has no mullions, muntins or wide frames that are visible from the exterior of the building; and

      (ii) The glazing consists of clear glass or other transparent material. If these conditions are not met a permit will be required.

   (2) A permit is required for installation of exterior storm windows.

(b) Exterior storm windows shall fit tightly within window openings without the need for subframe or panning around the perimeter. The color of frames of exterior storm windows shall match the color of the primary window frame. Clear glass only will be permitted. The storm sash shall be set as far back from the plane of the exterior wall surface as practicable. Muntins shall not be permitted. Meeting rails may be used only in conjunction with doublehung windows and shall be placed in the same relative location as in the primary sash.






*§ 3-04 Replacement of Sash and Frames.* ::


If the windows have deteriorated to a condition that warrants replacement, new windows will be permitted under the following conditions:

(a) A permit is required for the installation of new sash in existing frames. In cases where the sash is deteriorated to a point precluding reasonable repair, rehabilitation or restoration, replacement sash may be installed subject to the issuance of a permit. In determining whether sash cannot be repaired, the Landmarks Preservation Commission will consider the percentage of the window that is deteriorated, the practicality of repair, trade practice and such other factors as the LPC may deem appropriate. The new sash shall match the existing sash in dimensions, configuration, operation, details, material, and finish except as provided below. If the rehabilitation of frames is required in conjunction with an application for new sash, that work shall be part of the application.

(b) A permit is required for the installation of new sash and frames in landmarks and buildings in historic districts.

(c) New sash and frames in primary facades:

   (1) Individual landmarks:

      (i) If historic windows have deteriorated to a point precluding reasonable repair, rehabilitation or restoration, based on a condition report submitted by the applicant, or a field inspection by the staff, or other evidence, including the percentage of the window that is deteriorated, the practicality of repair, trade practice and other factors, replacement windows may be approved if they match the historic windows in terms of:

(A) configuration,

(B) operation,

(C) details,

(D) material, and

(E) finish.

      (ii) Variations in details will be permitted if such variations do not significantly affect the visual characteristics of the window, including the shadow effect of muntins and sash on the glazing. In evaluating "significant" effect, factors to be considered shall be the age of the building and its architectural quality, as well as the extent of diminution in the total glazed area of sash. For wood windows less than 15 inches wide, the diminution shall be limited to 10%; for wood windows 15 inches or wider, the diminution shall be limited to 6%; for metal windows (of any size) the diminution shall be limited to 10%.

      (iii) With respect to matching of materials, the following shall be understood: a wood historic window shall be replaced in wood, but not necessarily of the same species. A metal historic window shall be replaced with metal but not necessarily of the same metal.

   (2) Buildings in historic districts.

      (i) Rowhouses, town houses, mansions, detached and semi-detached houses and carriage houses:

   (3) Other buildings: For buildings that do not fall into any of the previously described categories, the finding of appropriateness of window replacements will be made on a case-by-case basis. Variations in design of these specialized buildings preclude the applicability of guidelines. Such special building types include churches and synagogues, hospitals, schools, libraries and the one- or two-story commercial building known as a "taxpayer." Also included in this category are buildings which, unless specifically noted in the text of these guidelines, have been converted from their original use.

(d) New sash and frames in secondary facades.

   (1) If existing windows, or new windows in new window openings approved under § 2-15 of this title, are visible from a public thoroughfare, replacement windows may be approved if:

      (i) they match the historic windows in terms of configuration and finish, or otherwise do not detract from the windows on the primary façade;

      (ii) they are to be installed in:

(A) existing window openings;

(B) existing window openings that are to be enlarged or reduced in height or width in a manner that retains the same general shape and pattern as existing windows on the same façade, or that form a regular and consistent pattern; or

Chapter 6: Proposed Alterations and New Construction of Structures and Landscapes In the Riverdale Historic District
--------------------------------------------------



*§ 6-01 Introduction.* ::


The purpose of these rules is to establish the Landmarks Preservation Commission's regulatory policy in the Riverdale Historic District. The Riverdale Historic District which was developed as an early railroad suburb is characterized as a distinct area of the city by its dramatic and verdant topography and its fine examples of nineteenth and early twentieth century dwellings and carriage houses. The houses and other buildings in the district are harmoniously sited within the landscape and are separated from each other by landscape Improvements. Landscaping in the Riverdale Historic District provides the picturesque setting which is a defining element of a romantic style suburb of the nineteenth century. Landscape Improvements such as trees, stone walls and hedges, used to define property lines, and additional plantings within the expansive gardens and alongside the houses, add to the special character of the Historic District. The district contains 34 buildings of varied type and age. The development of the Riverdale Historic District is important in understanding the district's historic character. Originally, the area was comprised of only seven estates which were served by a common carriage alley (Sycamore Avenue). All of the estates were developed in the 1850s. Several early estate houses remain, as well as stables and carriage houses (later converted for residential use). The configuration of these estates remained intact until 1935, when the original parcels began to be subdivided for development. Four new houses were built between 1935 and 1938. No new buildings were built thereafter until 1950. From 1950 to 1980 twelve new structures were constructed. These newer structures are stylistically diverse but are generally compatible with the older buildings in terms of their placement, height, materials and finish.

Applications also may be supplemented, as necessary, with photographs of existing conditions, construction details, materials samples, specifications, and maps, to best explain the proposed work.

  




Chapter 9: Alterations To Designated Bank Interiors
--------------------------------------------------



*§ 9-01 Introduction.* ::


(a)  These rules are issued to assist building owners in applying to the Landmarks Preservation Commission (LPC) for approval of applications to undertake repair, rehabilitation, replacement of, or alterations to interior architectural features within designated bank interiors. The rules set forth Commission policy with respect to such repair, rehabilitation, replacement, or alteration and explain the procedures required to apply for a permit. The goal of these rules is to facilitate and encourage the continued historic use of these interiors as banking floors and to facilitate the adaptive reuse of the interior if it ceases to be used as a banking floor.

(b) These rules are based on the following principles:

   (1) The significant original visual qualities or character of a designated interior should not be destroyed. The removal or alteration of any significant architectural feature should be avoided whenever possible.

   (2) Significant but deteriorated architectural features should be repaired rather than replaced whenever possible.

   (3) Certain interior alterations can be approved at staff level in conformance with the procedures set forth in these rules. Other interior alterations require review by the full Commission in accordance with its usual review procedures.

(c) These rules are keyed to underlined portions of the Description section of the Designation Reports for these interior landmarks, which identify significant architectural features requiring protection.

(d) Applicants are encouraged to submit applications for Master Plans which will govern the approval of routine and continuing alterations such as installation of mechanical and electrical equipment.

Correcting a violation does not include or otherwise permit the reinstallation of a preexisting condition or the installation of a substitute condition. For example, a violation for the installation of a sign or awning without a permit, where such installation involved the removal of a preexisting sign or awning, may not be corrected by reinstalling the prior sign or awning, or installing a different sign or awning. A violation is not corrected for purposes of section 25-317.1b(6) of the Landmarks Law if the same or a similar illegal condition is installed within 180 days of the respondent's representation to the Commission that the violation has been corrected.

(e) A violation is "legalized" when the Commission issues a permit approving and authorizing the work that was done without a permit.

(f) A violation is "cured" where the Commission issues a permit authorizing modifications to the illegal condition to make it appropriate, or where the Commission authorizes work to replace the illegal work, and the modification or replacement work is completed and the Commission has issued a Notice of Compliance.

(g) For purposes of sections 11-03, 11-04 and 11-06, the term "mail," "mailed" and "mailing" shall mean first class United States mail or express or overnight delivery to a respondent as follows:

The warning letter shall inform the respondent that the LPC believes a violation of the Landmarks Law has occurred at the subject premises and shall also: (1) describe the violation in general detail; (2) warn the respondent that the law authorizes civil and criminal penalties for violations; (3) notify the respondent that a NOV may be served unless, within 20 working days of the date of the warning letter, the violation is corrected or an application to legalize or cure the violation is received by the Commission.






*§ 11-05 Notice of Violation; Grace Period.* ::


(a)  A respondent shall qualify for the grace period set forth in section 25-317.1b(6) of the Administrative Code by delivering, at least 14 days prior to the hearing date set forth in the NOV, the following to the Commission:

Chapter 12: Historic District Master Plans
--------------------------------------------------



*§ 12-01 District Master Plans and Authorizations to Proceed.* ::


(a)  Introduction. The Commission may develop master plans for the historic district, specific types of buildings within a historic district, distinctive areas within the historic district or for landmark sites containing multiple buildings. A district master plan may address common design issues such as storefront design, signage, sidewalk and areaway alterations as well as set forth specific alterations for individual buildings in an historic district or on a landmark site in a comprehensive manner that respects the significant architectural features and particular history of the historic district with allowances for specific building conditions. A district master plan may serve as a research tool or design guide for owners or tenants who wish to make alterations to their buildings. Upon the adoption of implementation rules as set forth in this rule, Commission staff can also issue authorizations to proceed for certain types of alterations or work set forth in the district master plan. A District Master Plan does not preclude the Commission's consideration and approval of applications for proposed work that is not in compliance with the District Master Plan.

(b) District Master Plans. Upon its own motion, the Commission may consider a master plan for alterations in a specific historic district, an individual landmark site containing multiple buildings or with respect to certain types of buildings or types of work in a specific historic district ("District Master Plan"). A District Master Plan may be approved by a Certificate of Appropriateness, a Certificate of No Effect on Protected Architectural Features, or a Permit for Minor Work, depending on the work covered by the plan.

(c) Calendaring. A District Master Plan will not be scheduled for the Commission's consideration unless the Commission, in its discretion and upon the adoption of a motion, votes to calendar the District Master Plan for a public hearing. A motion to calendar a proposed District Master Plan for further consideration must be approved by the majority of Commissioners present in order to be adopted. The date of the public hearing on the proposed District Master Plan may be set by the motion to calendar or may be set at some later time by the Chairman, acting at his or her discretion.

(d) Public Hearing. If the Commission votes to calendar a District Master Plan for further consideration, a public hearing will be held in accordance with § 25-308 of the Administrative Code of New York City and the provisions of Chapter One of these Rules.

(e) Approval and Implementation. Following the public hearing, the Commission may vote to approve, approve with modifications, or disapprove the District Master Plan. If the District Master Plan is approved or approved with modifications, the District Master Plan may be implemented by the enactment of Rules in accordance with the City Administrative Procedure Act that specifically reference the District Master Plan ("Implementation Rules"). The Implementation Rules shall establish the scope and applicability of the District Master Plan and shall set forth the application procedures and the criteria for issuance of Authorizations to Proceed ("ATP's", see subsection 12-01(f) below) pursuant to the District Master Plan. Any work permitted under the Implementation Rules pursuant to an ATP must be described with reasonable specificity as to design and materials in the District Master Plan. The public hearing for the proposed District Master Plan may be held concurrently with the public hearing for the Implementation Rules. However, the Commission must vote to approve the District Master Plan before it votes to approve the Implementation Rules and the District Master Plan shall have no force and effect until the Implementation Rules are adopted in accordance with the City Administrative Procedure Act.

(f) Authorizations to Proceed. All applications for work pursuant to the District Master Plan must be signed by the building owner in accordance with § 2-01 of these Rules and must state that the application is being filed pursuant to the District Master Plan. Each application shall include drawings, specifications and other materials which describe the proposed work in detail. Commission staff will review the application to ascertain whether the proposed work is in accordance with the District Master Plan and the Implementation Rules. If Commission staff determines that the work is in compliance with the District Master Plan and the Implementation Rules, the staff will send the applicant an "Authorization to Proceed" letter ("ATP") allowing the work to commence. The ATP must be obtained prior to the commencement of work and posted on the building while work is in progress. Each ATP shall be valid for four (4) years from the date of such ATP and may be renewed upon application provided that Commission staff determines that the work authorized under the original ATP remains in compliance with the District Master Plan and the Implementation Rules in effect on the date of such renewal. Issuance or renewal of a District Master Plan ATP is contingent upon the work's adherence to the District Master Plan and the materials and plans submitted and approved by Commission staff in connection with the ATP.

(g) Amendment and Rescission. Upon its own motion, the Commission may amend or rescind a District Master Plan at any time, provided the Commission first holds a public hearing on the proposed amendment or rescission. In its discretion, the Commission shall calendar a public hearing with respect to such proposed amendment or rescission in accordance with the provisions of § 12-01(b) of these Rules. Any Commission action to amend or rescind a District Master Plan shall be in accordance with the provisions of § 1-04 of these Rules.






*§ 12-02 Stone Street Historic District Master Plan Implementation Rules.* ::


(a)  Introduction. The Stone Street Historic District is a low-scale cluster of early nineteenth-century commercial structures, complemented by several picturesque early twentieth-century buildings designed by prominent architects. The Stone Street Historic District is a distinct enclave amidst the surrounding twentieth-century skyscrapers and is sited on narrow winding streets originally laid out by Dutch Colonists. The Stone Street Historic District Master Plan Implementation Rules ("Rules") are promulgated to assist building owners who own buildings located within the Stone Street Historic District in applying to the Landmarks Preservation Commission ("LPC") for approval of applications to undertake repair, rehabilitation, replacement, or alterations to storefronts (including but not limited to storefront infill, lighting, signage, security gates) and cellar entrances, and to make such buildings accessible to persons with disabilities, that are in accordance with the Stone Street Master Plan approved by the Commission. The Stone Street Master Plan is a master plan governing work to storefronts and cellar entrances, as well as alterations to make buildings within the historic district accessible to persons with disabilities. The Stone Street Master Plan will be the subject of a Certificate of Appropriateness determination at the same public hearing as these Rules. The Rules set forth herein will permit the LPC staff to issue Authorization to Proceed letters ("ATP") for work that complies with the approved Stone Street Master Plan. The goal of these Rules is to encourage appropriate repair, rehabilitation, replacement and alterations in the Stone Street Historic District by expediting the process of obtaining permits to perform such work. Work that is not in accordance with the Stone Street Master Plan will be reviewed by the Commission in accordance with its usual review procedures as set forth in the Landmarks Law.
