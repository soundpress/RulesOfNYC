Chapter 5: Disposition of Personal Property
--------------------------------------------------



*§ 5-01 Disposition of Personal Property of the City.* ::


(a)  Personal property may be disposed of by the Division of Municipal Supplies by public or private sale or as otherwise authorized by law or regulation.

   (1) The prior approval of the Comptroller is not required on a sale of personal property where such sale is to the highest responsible bidder at public auction or after receipt of sealed bids after advertisement in at least ten successive issues of The City Record. A bidder may be disqualified in accordance with applicable laws and regulations.

   (2) If the estimated sales value of the personal property is $5,000 or less, the Division of Municipal Supply Services may make requests for offers, if possible, to at least three persons, firms or corporations separately engaged in the regular business of selling and buying materials of the class offered. All bids from other bidders shall be duly considered in making an award. Award of such informal sale, if any, must be made to the highest responsible bidder. However, no such award shall be valid without the prior approval of the comptroller. The total amount of such informal sales of the same class of materials shall not exceed $5,000 within a thirty-day period. The classification of materials of "the same class" shall be as determined by the commissioner and approved by the comptroller. Such classification shall be filed in the Division of Municipal Supply Services and the Office of the Comptroller and shall be effective upon publication in the City Record.

   (3) When no bid or acceptable bid is received on an advertised sale, the Commissioner may waive the advertising requirements in an informal re-bid. Such sale on an informal re-bid shall be made only with the approval of the Comptroller. The Commissioner shall issue a certificate in writing that no acceptable bid was received when the proposal was originally advertised. Such certificate shall be filed in the Division of Municipal Supplies and with the Comptroller.

   (4) Personal property may be given to a vendor in part payment on a contract at public letting to furnish new personal property at the lowest net price.

   (5) Personal property may be sold at private sale without public notice, at no less than the value fixed by the Division of Municipal Supplies subject to the approval of the Comptroller.

   (6) Personal property may be transferred between the various City agencies by order of the Commissioner.

   (7) All materials, supplies and equipment which the Commissioner considers of no sale value or use to the City may be destroyed or otherwise disposed of in the most advantageous manner under the direction of the Commissioner. This provision shall not apply to public records until their destruction or other disposition has been duly authorized in accordance with applicable law or regulation.

   (8) Notwithstanding any of the foregoing, property classified by the commissioner as "memorabilia" may be disposed of in the best interests of the city by public, private, wholesale or retail sale under the direction of the commissioner without the prior approval of the comptroller. "Memorabilia" is defined as surplus or obsolete personal property, excluding aircraft, watercraft and land vehicles, not exceeding an estimated per-unit sale value of $5,000, which by reason of its use by the city has historic, aesthetic, novelty or sentimental value in excess of the property's salvage value. In addition to a wholesale or retail price not exceeding an estimated per-unit sale value of $5,000, the commissioner is authorized to negotiate in the best interests of the city to obtain additional income from the disposition of "memorabilia".

   (9) Notwithstanding any of the foregoing, property classified as a "product" by the commissioner, in conjunction with the commissioner or head of another agency or office, may be disposed of, as the commissioner deems appropriate, by that individual agency. "Product" is defined as property resulting from the processing, manufacture, or operations of an agency or its agent. "Agent" is defined as an individual or entity that is authorized to act for the agency by contract or other apparent authority. That individual agency must dispose of that property in the best interests of the city by public, private, wholesale or retail sale at a unit price to be determined by the respective agency's commissioner or his/her designee, and under the direction of said commissioner or his/her designee. If disposal by private sale is deemed appropriate, and the estimated per sale value is less than or equal to $10,000, the sale may proceed without the prior approval of the comptroller. In determining the unit price to be charged for the product, the respective agency must factor in the cost of producing each product. The agency must also factor in the fair market wholesale and retail rates currently being charged by a minimum of three entities that are marketing the same or similar products for wholesale or retail sale in the local region.

(a) "Company #1" includes the company which seeks to enter a contract with a City agency, and is determining whether it is qualified to sign the City's anti-apartheid rider, and all "affiliates" of that company, as that term is defined in Administrative Code § 6-115(a)(8).

(b) "Sale" includes lease or rental of equipment.

(c) An "original equipment manufacturer agreement" ("O.E.M. agreement") is an agreement between a manufacturer (Company #1) and another manufacturer, a distributor, or a value-added reseller (Company #2), such that Company #1 provides products (which may include parts, components and/or subassemblies) and authorizes the sale of such products by Company #2 under any of the following circumstances:

   (1) Company #1 makes a sale of its equipment to Company #2, which, with or without making minor modifications to the equipment, privately labels and sells it.

   (2) Company #1 makes a sale of its equipment to Company #2, which provides substantial added value to Company #1's product before selling it. Company #2's added value may be major application software and/or special hardware integrated into the product. Examples include:

      (i) an O.E.M. agreement whereby Company #2 adds banking application software to Company #1's personal computer, marketing the resulting product as a banking teller station under Company #2's brand name.

      (ii) an O.E.M. agreement whereby Company #2 embeds a subassembly purchased from Company #1, such as a disk drive or a telecommunications multiplexor, into Company #2's computer system, and then sells that computer system under its own brand name.

      (iii) Company #1 makes a sale to Company #2, which resells Company #1's product with Company #1's name still intact on the product. An example would be an O.E.M. agreement whereby Company #2 sells Company #1's word processor and licensed software as an authorized dealer (exclusive or non-exclusive) of Company #1.

(d) An O.E.M. agreement for equipment sold by a manufacturer of computers, copiers or telecommunications equipment is considered to "provide for or authorize the sale of such equipment, alone or as part of a finished product, to a South African entity" if any of the following conditions is met:

   (1) The O.E.M. agreement states that Company #2 may sell equipment made by Company #1 (with or without modification by Company #2) in South Africa.

   (2) The equipment covered by the agreement (as sold by Company #1 or after modification by Company #2, if any is made) falls under one of the designated classifications government by the Export Administration Act of 1979  and the associated federal regulations for Electronics and Precision Instruments (15 C.F.R. § 799.1, Supp. 1, Group 5), such that Company #1 knows of the resale or distribution of the equipment to South Africa by Company #2 and assists Company #2 in procuring required governmental authorizations for such resale or distribution.

   (3) Company #1 has actual knowledge of resale or distribution of the equipment to South Africa by Company #2 and has not either terminated its contractual arrangement with Company #2 concerning such equipment or otherwise prohibited Company #2 from making further resale or distribution of Company #1's equipment to South Africa.

Chapter 8: Contracts For the Purchase of Products Containing Secondary Material and Minimum Secondary Material Content Standards For the Purchase of Establishing Price Preference Eligibility
--------------------------------------------------



*§ 8-01 Purpose.* ::


New York City's Recycling Law, which is codified as §§ 16-301 et seq. of the Administrative Code of the City of New York encourages the use of "secondary materials" in the manufacture of products purchased by DMSS for use by various city agencies and departments. A mechanism authorized by the Recycling Law to achieve the goal of purchasing products made from secondary materials is the authority to award a contract pursuant to a "price preference." Simply stated, the City is given the discretion to determine that the public interest will be served by awarding contracts for the purchase of specified products to other than the lowest responsive and responsible bidder provided that the product contains a mandated "minimum amount of secondary material" and that the price is within the specified percentage of the price bid by the lowest responsive and responsible bidder.






*§ 8-02 Definitions.* ::


Aggregate product purchase. "Aggregate product purchase" shall mean a procurement of products by DMSS which consists of a group or groups of products which are related to each other in one of the following ways:

(1) The products are manufactured by a single manufacturer and are purchased in the form of a price list which is a listing of items and their prices;

(2) The products are contained in a published catalog which is offered to DMSS at prices listed in the catalog or at a discount therefrom; or

(3) The products have been combined in a class for award to a single vendor based upon fiscal, operational or pricing advantages.

Commissioner. "Commissioner" shall mean the Commissioner of the Department of Citywide Administrative Services of the City of New York, or his or her designee.

Contract. "Contract" means a procurement by DMSS to purchase goods, the total value of which is in excess of $10,000 (or such other amount as the Procurement Policy Board Rules may hereafter establish as the ceiling below which the procurement is treated as a small purchase).

DMSS. "DMSS" means the Division of Municipal Supply Services of the Department of Citywide Administrative Services.

Minimum amount of secondary material. "Minimum amount of secondary material" means the secondary material content level established by these Rules as the minimum percentage required for a product to potentially qualify for a price preference in accordance with Administrative Code § 16-322.

Post-consumer material. "Post-consumer material" means only those products generated by a business or a consumer which have served their intended end uses, and which have been separated or diverted from solid waste for the purposes of collection, recycling and disposition.

Procurement Policy Board Rules. "Procurement Policy Board Rules" means the regulations originally effective September 1, 1990 governing contracting by city agencies which are promulgated by the Procurement Policy Board of the City of New York as those rules may, from time to time, be amended.

Secondary material. "Secondary material" means any material recovered from or otherwise destined for the waste stream, including but not limited to, post-consumer material, industrial scrap material and overstock or obsolete inventories from distributors, wholesalers and other companies, but such term does not include those materials and by-products generated from and commonly reused within an original manufacturing process.

USEPA. "USEPA" means the United States Environmental Protection Agency.






*§ 8-03 Minimum Content Standards and Applicability of Price Preference.* ::


(a) Applicability of price preference. In general, on a contract let by DMSS for the purchase of a product, a bidder shall be eligible for the price preference set forth in § 16-322 of the Administrative Code for such product only if such bidder offers to supply such product manufactured with the minimum content of secondary material specified in these Rules.

(b) Minimum content standards incorporated. DMSS shall utilize the minimum content standards for secondary materials contained in the tables in subdivision (g) of this section to determine eligibility for the price preference set forth in § 16-322 of the Administrative Code, provided, however, that, except as provided in subdivision (c) of this section, DMSS shall utilize all minimum content standards for secondary materials subsequently promulgated or amended by either USEPA or the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation (DEC), and if there is a conflict between USEPA and DEC standards, DMSS shall utilize the highest standard that it is permitted to utilize by § 16-322 of the Administrative Code.

(c) Minimum content standards for aggregate product purchases, multi-material products, and metals. Except as provided by § 16-322, notwithstanding any other provision of this section, the minimum content standard for the following products shall be zero:

   (1) any product which DMSS purchases by means of an aggregate product purchase, except where such aggregate product purchase consists solely of products that are substantially manufactured from the same material, and for which the same minimum content standard applies or identical numerical minimum content standards apply;

   (2) any product that is not substantially manufactured from a single material; and

   (3) metal products.

(d) Recycled product purchases. DMSS may restrict bids solely to products composed of specified minimum secondary material content levels. If the minimum secondary material content level specified by DMSS for such a bid is less than the minimum secondary material content standard for such product set forth in these Rules, a bidder may be eligible for a price preference if such bidder offers to provide such product with a level of secondary material content that is equal to or greater than the minimum content standard specified in these Rules.

(e) Market stimulus bids. Except for products for which DMSS is required to utilize a USEPA minimum content standard for secondary materials pursuant to Administrative Code § 16-322, DMSS may stipulate that for a specific bid a price preference shall only be applicable to products which satisfy additional minimum content standards or higher minimum content standards than those set forth in these Rules, provided that DMSS first finds that such additional or higher standards are intended to stimulate the market for secondary materials.

(f) Packaging. Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, this section does not apply to packaging incidental to the product being purchased.

In this event, the applicant will be informed of alternative locations or times for the covered activity.

c. Permits may be denied on the following grounds:

      (i) A permit has previously been granted to another applicant for a covered activity for the date and time requested.

      (ii) It reasonably appears that the covered activity will present a clear and present danger to the public safety, good order or health.

      (iii) The application proposes activities which would be in violation of law or regulation.

      (v) The Police Department determines that the proposed covered activity conflicts with security needs anticipated for the time and place of the proposed activity. In the event that a permit is denied under paragraphs (i), (iv) or (v), the applicant will be informed of alternative locations or times available for the covered activity.

d. Covered activities are subject to the following additional limitations:

      (i) Applicants for permits that are issued in error because an event enumerated in 55 RCNY § 10-02 had previously been calendared or a permit had previously been granted for another covered activity will be notified and provided with a reasonable opportunity to conduct the covered activity at an alternative location or an alternative time.

      (ii) No permit will authorize the erection or placement of structures.

      (iii) Permits shall authorize only one covered activity by one permit holder at a time.

      (iv) Permits shall extend for a period of not more than three hours.

e.

Revocations of previously granted permits which occur at least 10 days prior to the covered activity shall be made in writing.






*§ 10-07 [Revocation of Permit.]* ::


During the conduct of covered activities, a permit may be revoked by the ranking on-site New York City police officer if the covered activity or other circumstances (i) present a clear and present danger to the public safety, good order or health; (ii) interfere with ingress to or egress from City Hall or otherwise violate the terms and conditions contained in the permit; or (iii) result in bodily harm to any individual, damage to property, or imminent breach of the peace such that good order cannot otherwise be maintained.

(d) If the ACCO determines the application is not responsive, the ACCO will notify the Security Guard Company by electronic mail within 30 days of receipt of the application. If the Security Guard Company fails to respond with all material terms and conditions, including supplying required documentation, within 60 days of receipt of its application, the application may be denied as nonresponsive. A denial for non-responsiveness does not preclude the Security Guard Company from reapplying to the Department.

(e) The Qualified Provider List shall be comprised of responsible Security Guard Companies only. A Security Guard Company must affirmatively demonstrate its responsibility.

   (i) A responsible Security Guard Company is one which can perform fully the program requirements and also has the business integrity to justify the award of public tax dollars.

      (1) Factors affecting a Security Guard Company's responsibility may include:

         A. financial resources;

         B. technical qualifications;

         C. experience;

         D. a satisfactory record of performance; and

         E. a satisfactory record of business integrity.

      (2) Failure of a firm to provide relevant information regarding the Security Guard Company's responsibility specifically requested by the ACCO may be grounds for a determination of non-responsibility.

      (3) A Security Guard Company that has performed unsatisfactorily in the provision of services to the City shall be presumed to be non-responsible, unless the ACCO determines that the circumstances were beyond the company's control or that the company has taken appropriate corrective action. Past failure to apply sufficient tenacity and perseverance to perform acceptably is strong evidence of non-responsibility.

   (ii) Making the Responsibility Determination.

      (1) The ACCO shall use the following sources of information to support determinations of responsibility or non-responsibility:

         A. the VENDEX database of debarred, suspended, and ineligible contractors;

         B. VENDEX and other records of evaluations of performance, as well as verifiable knowledge of contracting and audit personnel;

         C. determinations of violations of employment-related federal, state, or local law or executive order, including but not limited to those relating to equal employment opportunity, prevailing wage, workplace health and safety, employee benefits, and employee wages and hours;

         D. information supplied by the Security Guard Company, including application information, financial data, and personnel information; and

         E. other sources, such as publications, suppliers, subcontractors and customers of the prospective contractor, financial institutions, other government agencies, and business and trade associations.

      (2) The ACCO may notify a Security Guard Company of unfavorable responsibility information and provide the Security Guard Company an opportunity to submit additional information or explain its actions before denying the Security Guard Company inclusion on the Qualified Provider List.

   (iii) Determination of Non-Responsibility Required.

      (1) If a Security Guard Company who otherwise would have been placed on the Qualified Provider List is found non-responsible, a determination of non-responsibility setting forth in detail and with specificity the reasons for the finding of non-responsibility shall be prepared by the ACCO.

      (2) A copy of the determination of non-responsibility shall be immediately sent to the Security Guard Company. Notice to the non-responsible Security Guard Company must be mailed no later than two business days after the determination of non-responsibility is made and must inform the Security Guard Company of the right to appeal the determination pursuant to subdivision h of this section. A copy of the determination of non-responsibility shall also be sent to the City Chief Procurement Officer.

      (3) The determination of non-responsibility shall be included in the VENDEX database.

(f) Upon the determination by the ACCO that an application meets the requirements set forth herein, the Department shall notify the applicant of its inclusion on the Qualified Provider List by regular and electronic mail within 90 days of receipt of its application. The Qualified Provider List will be reviewed periodically to ensure that providers continue to meet the necessary qualifications.

(g) At least once every two years, each Security Guard Company on the Qualified Provider List must affirm that there has been no change in the information included in its original application or must supply such changed information. Failure to supply such affirmation of no change will result in the Security Guard Company's removal from the Qualified Provider List until the affirmation of no change or the updated information has been supplied to the Department. Any Security Guard Company that is removed from the Qualified Provider List and re-applies must also provide an affirmation of no change or updated information.

(h) A Security Guard Company must retain all certified payroll records, which verify that its Security Guards were paid at least the prevailing wages and supplements for unarmed security guards as determined by the Comptroller of the City of New York pursuant to New York State Labor Law § 234.

(i) Determination of Non-responsibility or Denial or Revocation of Qualification.

   (1) If the Department determines that a Security Guard Company is non-responsible or otherwise not qualified as a provider or the Department revokes such qualification, the Security Guard Company may appeal in writing to the Commissioner or the Commissioner's designee within 10 days of receipt of the Department's determination, denial, or revocation. Receipt of notice by the Security Guard Company shall be deemed to be no later than five days from the date of mailing or upon delivery, if delivered. Filing of the appeal shall be accomplished by actual delivery of the appeal document to the office of the Commissioner.

   (2) The written appeal by the Security Guard Company must briefly state all the facts or other basis upon which the Security Guard Company contests the Department's determination, denial, or revocation. Supporting documentation must be included.

   (3) The Commissioner or the Commissioner's designee shall consider the Security Guard Company's appeal and shall make a prompt written decision no later than 60 days after receipt with respect to the merits of the Security Guard Company's appeal. The determination of the Commissioner or the Commissioner's designee shall be a final agency determination.
