Chapter 1: Conflicts of Interest
--------------------------------------------------



*§ 1-01 Valuable Gifts.* ::


(a)  For the purposes of Charter § 2604(b)(5), a "valuable gift" means any gift to a public servant which has a value of $50.00 or more, whether in the form of money, service, loan, travel, entertainment, hospitality, thing or promise, or in any other form. Two or more gifts to a public servant shall be deemed to be a single gift for purposes of this subdivision and Charter § 2604(b)(5) if they are given to the public servant within a twelve-month period under one or more of the following circumstances: (1) they are given by the same person; and/or (2) they are given by persons who the public servant knows or should know are (i) relatives or domestic partners of one another; or (ii) are directors, trustees, or employees of the same firm or affiliated firms.

(b) As used in subdivision (a) of this section, (1) "relative" shall mean a spouse, child, grandchild, parent, sibling, and grandparent; a parent, domestic partner, child, or sibling of a spouse or domestic partner; and a spouse or domestic partner of a parent, child, or sibling; (2) firms are "affiliated" if one is a subsidiary of the other or if they have a parent firm in common or if they have a stockholder in common that owns at least 25 percent of the shares of each firm; (3) "firm," "spouse," and "ownership interest" shall have the meaning ascribed to those terms in § 2601 of the Charter; (4) "domestic partner" means a domestic partner as defined in New York City Administrative Code § 1-112(21).

(c) For the purposes of Charter § 2604(b)(5), a public servant may accept gifts that are customary on family or social occasions from a family member or close personal friend who the public servant knows is or intends to become engaged in business dealings with the City, when:

   (1) it can be shown under all relevant circumstances that it is the family or personal relationship rather than the business dealings that is the controlling factor; and

   (2) the public servant's receipt of the gift would not result in or create the appearance of:

      (i) using his or her office for private gain;

      (ii) giving preferential treatment to any person or entity;

      (iii) losing independence or impartiality; or

      (iv) accepting gifts or favors for performing official duties.

(d) For the purposes of Charter § 2604(b)(5), a public servant may accept awards, plaques and other similar items which are publicly presented in recognition of public service, provided that the item or items have no substantial resale value.

(e) For the purposes of Charter § 2604(b)(5), a public servant may accept free meals or refreshments in the course of and for the purpose of conducting City business under the following circumstances:

   (1) when offered during a meeting which the public servant is attending for official reasons;

   (2) when offered at a company cafeteria, club or other setting where there is no public price structure and individual payment is impractical;

   (3) when a meeting the public servant is attending for official reasons begins in a business setting but continues through normal meal hours in a restaurant, and a refusal to participate and/or individual payment would be impractical;

   (4) when the free meals or refreshments are provided by the host entity at a meeting held at an out-of-the-way location, alternative facilities are not available and individual payment would be impractical; and

   (5) when the public servant would not have otherwise purchased food and refreshments had he or she not been placed in such a situation while representing the interests of the City.

(f) For the purposes of Charter § 2604(b)(5), a public servant may:

   (1) accept meals or refreshments when participating as a panelist or speaker in a professional or educational program and the meals or refreshments are provided to all panelists;

   (2) be present at a professional or educational program as a guest of the sponsoring organization;

   (3) be a guest at ceremonies or functions sponsored or encouraged by the City as a matter of City policy, such as, for example, those involving housing, education, legislation or government administration;

   (4) attend a public affair of an organization composed of representatives of business, labor, professions, news media or organizations of a civic, charitable or community nature, when invited by the sponsoring organization, provided that this exception does not apply when the invitation is from an organization which has business dealings, as defined in Charter § 2601(8), with, or a matter before, the public servant's agency;

   (5) be a guest at any function or occasion where the attendance of the public servant has been approved in writing as in the interests of the City, in advance where practicable or within a reasonable time thereafter, by the employee's agency head or by a deputy mayor if the public servant is an agency head.

(g) For the purposes of Charter § 2604(b)(5), a public servant who is an elected official or a member of the elected official's staff authorized by the elected official may attend a function given by an organization composed of representatives of business, labor, professions, news media or organizations of a civic, charitable or community nature, when invited by the sponsoring organization. For the purpose of this subdivision, the authorizing elected official for the central staff of the council is the speaker of the council.

(h) (1)  For the purposes of Charter § 2604(b)(5), a public servant's acceptance of travel-related expenses from a private entity can be considered a gift to the City rather than to the public servant, when:

(i) the trip is for a City purpose and therefore could properly be paid for with City funds;

      (ii) the travel arrangements are appropriate to that purpose; and

      (iii) the trip is no longer than reasonably necessary to accomplish the business which is its purpose.

   (2) To avoid an appearance of impropriety, it is recommended that for public servants who are not elected officials, each such trip and the acceptance of payment therefor be approved in advance and in writing by the head of the appropriate agency, or if the public servant is an agency head, by a deputy mayor.

      (i) A public servant should not accept a "valuable gift," as defined herein, from any person or entity engaged in business dealings with the City. If the public servant receives such valuable gift, he or she should return the gift to the donor. If that is not practical, the public servant should report the receipt of a valuable gift to the inspector general of the public servant's agency, who shall determine the appropriate disposition of the gift. Nothing in this section shall be deemed to authorize a public servant to act in violation of any applicable laws, including the criminal law, City agency rules, or Mayoral Executive Orders (including, but not limited to, Executive Order No. 16 of 1978 (as amended)), which may impose additional requirements to report gifts and offers of gifts to the agency's inspector general, whether or not a gift is accepted or returned.

(j) City agencies are encouraged to establish rules concerning gifts for their own employees which may not be less restrictive than as set forth in Charter § 2604(b)(5) as interpreted by this section.

(k) (1)  Nothing in this section shall be deemed to authorize a public servant to accept a gift of any value in violation of any other applicable federal, state or local law, rule or regulation, including but not limited to the New York State Penal Law.

   (2) The provisions of this section shall be read in conjunction with the provisions of Charter § 2604(b)(2) and § 1-13 of the Rules of the Board (prohibiting certain conduct that conflicts with the proper discharge of a public servant's official duties); § 2604(b)(3) of the Charter (prohibiting the use or attempted use of one's City position for private gain); and § 2604(b)(13) of the Charter (prohibiting receipt by public servants of compensation except from the City for performing any official duty and prohibiting receipt of gratuities).






*§ 1-02 Public Servants Charged with Substantial Policy Discretion.* ::


(a)  For purposes of Charter § 2604(b)(12) and § 2604(b)(15), a public servant is deemed to have substantial policy discretion if he or she has major responsibilities and exercises independent judgment in connection with determining important agency matters. Public servants with substantial policy discretion include, but are not limited to: agency heads, deputy agency heads, assistant agency heads, members of boards and commissions, and public servants in charge of any major office, division, bureau or unit of an agency. Agency heads shall:

   (1) designate by title, or position, and name the public servants in their agencies who have substantial policy discretion as defined by this section;

   (2) file annually with the Conflicts of Interest Board, no later than February 28 of each year, a list of such titles or positions and the names of the public servants holding them; and

   (3) notify these public servants in writing of the restrictions set forth in Charter § 2604(b)(12) and § 2604(b)(15) to which they are subject. If the Conflicts of Interest Board determines that the title, position, or name of any public servant should be added to or deleted from the list supplied by an agency, the Board shall notify the head of the agency involved of that addition or deletion; the agency shall in turn promptly notify the affected public servant of the change.

(b) Each agency may make available for public inspection a copy of the most recent list filed by the agency, with any additions or deletions made by the Board pursuant to subdivision (a) of this section.

*§ 1-15 City Employees Whose Duties Involve the Negotiation, Authorization, or Approval of Contracts and of Certain Other Matters.* ::


(a)  For purposes of Administrative Code § 12-110(b)(3)(a)(4), a City employee shall be deemed to have duties that involve the negotiation, authorization, or approval of contracts, leases, franchises, revocable consents, concessions, and applications for zoning changes, variances, and special permits if the employee performs any of the following duties:

*§ 1-17 Procedures to Appeal a Designation as a Required Filer of a Financial Disclosure Report.* ::


(a) Applicability. Any employee designated as a required filer by his or her agency may appeal the determination that he or she is required to file a financial disclosure report with the Conflicts of Interest Board ("the Board") pursuant to New York City Administrative Code § 12-110, first to his or her agency head and then to the Board.

(b) Appeal to the Agency Head.

   (1) Any employee seeking to appeal the determination that he or she is required to file a financial disclosure report shall complete a "Notice of Appeal to Agency Head," on such form as the Board shall adopt and make available on the Board's website. The completed form shall include the employee's name, employee identification number ("EIN") or agency identifier, agency name, agency code, civil service title, office title, and a brief statement of the grounds for the appeal.

   (2) An employee seeking to appeal such agency determination shall file, in the manner designated by the agency, the completed Notice of Appeal form with his or her agency financial disclosure liaison prior to the deadline for filing his or her financial disclosure report but in any event the employee shall have no fewer than twenty-one days within which to file such Notice of Appeal after receiving the notification by the agency that he or she must file a financial disclosure report. Failure to file the Notice of Appeal by the later of twenty-one days after such notification or the deadline for filing, as the case may be, shall constitute a waiver of the right to appeal and the employee will be required to file a financial disclosure report.

   (3) Upon receipt of the completed Notice of Appeal, the agency financial disclosure liaison shall:

      (i) Time and date stamp the Notice of Appeal form;

      (ii) Provide the employee with a copy of such time and date-stamped form as a receipt;

      (iii) Transmit the Notice of Appeal form forthwith to the agency head or his or her designee; and

      (iv) Within five days of the receipt of the Notice of Appeal, notify the Board by e-mail of the pendency of the appeal and the date that the appeal was received by the agency. Such notice to the Board shall contain the employee's name, agency, EIN (or agency identifier), and the date that the appeal was filed.

   (4) No later than fourteen days after filing the Notice of Appeal, the employee shall submit to his or her agency head or such agency head's designee a written statement and any documentation in support thereof setting forth the reasons that such employee believes he or she should not be designated as a required filer of a financial disclosure report. Failure to submit such written statement within such fourteen-day period shall constitute a waiver of the right to appeal.

   (5) Within fourteen days of the agency's receipt of the employee's written statement, the agency head or his or her designee shall advise in writing or by email the employee, his or her employee's collective bargaining representative, attorney or other representative, if any, and the Board of the agency's decision as to whether or not the employee is required to file. If the agency head or the agency head's designee fails to meet such fourteen-day deadline, the appeal shall be deemed granted upon default.

   (6) A decision of the agency head or his or her designee that denies an appeal shall set forth the reasons for and evidence relied upon in reaching such decision. Such denial shall be predicated on a showing that the employee meets the requirements of at least one of the filing categories set forth in New York City Administrative Code § 12-110(b)(3)(a)(3)-(4) and 53 RCNY §§ 1-02, 1-14, and 1-15 of the Board's rules. If the agency denies the appeal, the notice to the Board shall state the manner by which the employee was notified and the date of such notification.

   (7) The agency head or his or her designee may consult with the Board prior to rendering its decision.

(c) Procedure Upon Agency's Grant of Appeal. If the agency grants the employee's appeal, the employee's name shall be removed from the Board's list of required filers and the employee will not be required to file a financial disclosure report for that filing year or in future years until or unless the employee's title, position, duties, or responsibilities change in such a way that he or she would be required to file pursuant to the criteria set forth in New York City Administrative Code § 12-110(b).

(d) Procedure Upon Agency's Denial of Appeal.

   (1) An employee whose appeal is denied by his or her agency shall, within thirty days after service of the agency's notice of denial, either:

      (i) file a completed financial disclosure report with the Board, or

      (ii) file with the Board and with the employee's agency head or his or her designee a completed "Notice of Appeal to Board," on such form as the Board shall prescribe and make available on the Board's website. Failure to file either a financial disclosure report or an appeal with the Board within the thirty-day period shall constitute a waiver of the right to a further appeal and shall subject the employee to the imposition of the statutory late filing fine pursuant to Administrative Code § 12-110(g).

   (2) Within thirty days after filing of a Notice of Appeal to the Board, the employee shall file with the Board and file with the employee's agency head or his or her designee the following materials:

      (i) A copy of the statement and any supporting materials previously submitted to the agency head by the employee on the appeal in accordance with paragraph one of subdivision (a) of this section;

      (ii) A copy of the agency head's decision on such appeal; and

      (iii) Any supplemental documents the employee elects to provide.

   (3) Within thirty days after the employee files the materials set forth in paragraph two of this subdivision, the agency shall file with the Board all materials relied upon by the agency in making its determination that the employee is required to file a financial disclosure report, as well as any additional documents in support of the agency's determination.

   (4) Within thirty days after the agency has filed the materials set forth in paragraph three of this subdivision, the employee may file with the Board such additional materials as he or she deems necessary to either rebut evidence produced by the agency or otherwise support his or her position.

   (5) The Board's Director of Financial Disclosure shall review the agency's determination and the documents submitted by the employee and the agency and shall make a recommendation to the Board, or to the Executive Director upon delegation by the Board, as to whether the agency's determination should be upheld or reversed. The agency and employee shall each be served with a copy of the recommendation of the Director of Financial Disclosure and, within thirty days of service of the recommendation, may submit written comments to the Board or Executive Director, as the case may be, upon the proposed recommendation.

   (6) In the event that the Board, in its sole discretion, determines that issues are presented by the written materials filed on the appeal that require an evidentiary hearing, the Board may order such a hearing before the full Board, or, in the discretion of the Chair, before a member or members of the Board or before the Executive Director, designated for that purpose, at which the employee and agency may call witnesses to testify under oath to determine any such issue. If the Board requests additional information, both the employee and the agency shall provide to the Board whatever additional information it requests, within fourteen days after service of such a request in writing or by email by the Board. Failure of either party to timely provide any of the requested information may result in a summary finding adverse to that party.

   (7) The Board or the Executive Director, as the case may be, shall review the recommendation and any comments submitted in response thereto and issue a decision and order either upholding or reversing the agency's decision.

   (8) If the Board grants the appeal, the employee's name shall be removed from the Board's list of required filers and the employee will not be required to file a financial disclosure report for that filing year or in future years until or unless the employee's title, position, duties, or responsibilities change such that he or she would be required to file pursuant to the criteria set forth in New York City Administrative Code § 12-110(b).

   (9) If the appeal is denied, the employee shall either:

      (i) file a financial disclosure report for that filing year within thirty days after service of the denial of the appeal by the Board, and shall file for future years until or unless the employee's title, position, duties, or responsibilities change such that he or she would not be required to file pursuant to the criteria set forth in Administrative Code § 12-110(b); or

      (ii) commence, within the time provided by law, an Article 78 proceeding to review the Board's decision.

(e) General Provisions.

   (1) At all stages of the financial disclosure appeals process, the employee may be represented by a union representative, an attorney or other representative.

   (2) Once an employee files an appeal with the Board, neither the employee nor the agency or their respective representatives may communicate ex parte with any member of the Board staff or Board with respect to the matter, except on consent of the opposing party or in an emergency.

   (3) During the pendency of the appeal and any court proceeding timely brought by the employee to review a denial of the appeal by the Board, the employee need not file a financial disclosure report, and no late filing fines will be assessed for that period.

   (4) Whenever a deadline in the process set forth in this section is measured from the filing or service of notice and notice is filed or served by United States Postal Service mail, five days shall be added to the deadline.

   (5) The Board may, in its discretion and for good cause shown, extend any deadline set forth in this rule. An application for such extension must be made in writing and prior to the expiration of the deadline.

   (6) In the case of any appeal that is decided upon default, whether in favor of the employee or the agency, that decision shall apply to that filing year only and shall not be a determination on the merits.

   (7) Unless otherwise stated, any reference to a number of days specified as a period within which an act is required to be done means such number of calendar days.

   (8) Nothing in this rule shall prevent the Board from determining, pursuant to New York City Administrative Code § 12-110(b)(3)(a)(2)-(3), that any public servant, regardless of an agency's determination, is required to file a financial disclosure report.




Chapter 2: Procedural Rules For Hearings
--------------------------------------------------



*§ 2-01 Initial Determination.* ::


(a)  Notice. If the Board makes an initial determination, based on a complaint, investigation, or other information available to the Board, that there is probable cause to believe that a public servant (which for purposes of Charter § 2603(h) includes a former public servant) has violated a provision of Chapter 68 of the City Charter, the Board shall notify the public servant of its determination in writing. The notice shall contain a statement of the facts upon which the Board relied for its determination of probable cause and a statement of the provisions of law allegedly violated. The notice shall afford the public servant an opportunity, either orally or in writing, to respond to, explain, rebut, or provide information concerning the allegations in such notice within fifteen days of service of the notice. The notice shall also inform the public servant of his or her right to be represented by counsel or any other person, and shall include a copy of the Board's procedural rules. A notice of initial determination shall not be required in a proceeding brought pursuant to § 12-110 of the Administrative Code.

(b) Request for a Stay. In response to the Board's notice, the public servant may apply to the Board for a stay of the proceedings, for good cause shown. The Board may grant or deny such request in its sole discretion.

(c) Admission of Facts. If, in response to the Board's notice, the public servant admits to the facts contained therein or to a violation of the provisions of Chapter 68 of the City Charter and elects to forgo a hearing, the Board may, after consulting with the head of the agency served or formerly served by the public servant, or, in the case of an agency head, after consulting with the Mayor, issue an order finding a violation and imposing the penalties it deems appropriate under Chapter 68 of the City Charter, provided, however, that pursuant to Charter § 2603(h)(3), the Board shall not impose penalties against members of the City Council, or public servants employed by the City Council or by members of the City Council, but may recommend to the City Council such penalties as the Board deems appropriate. When a penalty is recommended, the City Council shall report to the Board what action was taken.

(d) No Probable Cause Finding. If, after receipt of the public servant's response, the Board determines that there is no probable cause to believe that a violation has occurred, the Board shall dismiss the matter and inform the public servant in writing of its decision.






*§ 2-02 Commencement of Formal Proceedings and Pleadings.* ::


(a)  Determination of Probable Cause. If, after consideration of the public servant's response, the Board determines that there remains probable cause to believe that a violation of the provisions of Chapter 68 of the City Charter has occurred, and the public servant has not elected to forgo the hearing, the Board shall hold or direct a hearing to be held on the record to determine whether such violation has occurred. If the public servant is subject to the jurisdiction of a state law provision or collective bargaining agreement which provides for the conduct of a disciplinary hearing by another body, the Board shall refer the matter to the appropriate entity. The hearing shall be conducted in accordance with the rules of that entity. The Board may also refer a matter to the public servant's agency if the Board deems the violation to be minor or if other disciplinary charges are pending there against the public servant.

(b) Petition. The Board shall institute formal proceedings by serving a petition on the public servant. The petition shall set forth the facts which, if proved, would constitute a violation of Chapter 68 of the City Charter or Section 12-110 of the Administrative Code, as well as the applicable provisions thereof which are alleged to have been violated. The petition shall also advise the public servant of the public servant's rights to file an answer, to a hearing, to be represented at such hearing by counsel or any other person, and to cross-examine witnesses and present evidence.

(c) Answer.

   (1) General Rule. The public servant shall answer the petition by serving an answer on the Board within eight days after service of the petition, unless a different time is fixed by the Board. The public servant shall serve the answer personally or by certified or registered mail, return receipt requested.

   (2) Form and Contents of Answer. The answer shall be in writing and shall contain specific responses, by admission, denial, or otherwise, to each allegation of the petition and shall assert all affirmative defenses, if any. The public servant may include in the answer matters in mitigation. The answer shall be signed and shall contain the full name, address, and telephone number of the public servant. If the public servant is represented, the representative's name, address, and telephone number shall also appear on the answer, which shall be signed by either the public servant or by his or her representative.

   (3) Effect of Failure to Answer. If the public servant fails to serve an answer, all allegations of the petition shall be deemed admitted and the Board shall proceed to hold a hearing in which prosecuting counsel shall submit for the record an offer of proof establishing the factual basis on which the Board may issue an order. If the public servant fails to respond specifically to any allegation or charge in the petition, such allegation or charge shall be deemed admitted.

(d) Amendment of Pleadings. Pleadings shall be amended as promptly as possible upon conditions just to all parties. If a pleading is to be amended less than twenty-five days before the commencement of the hearing, the amendment may be made only on consent of the parties or by leave of the Board, if the Board is conducting the hearing, or by leave of a Board member or Administrative Law Judge, if the Board member or Administrative Law Judge is conducting the hearing.






*§ 2-03 Hearing.* ::


(a)  Conduct of Hearings Generally. Hearings shall be conducted by the Board or, upon designation by the Board, by a member of the Board or the Chief Administrative Law Judge of the Office of Administrative Trials and Hearings (OATH), or such administrative law judge (ALJ) as the Chief Administrative Law Judge shall assign.

(b) Subpoenas. Subpoenas requiring the attendance of a witness and subpoenas duces tecum requiring the production of books, papers, and other things may be issued only by (i) the Administrative Law Judge, where the hearing has been referred to OATH, or (ii) a member of the Board, where the hearing is conducted by the Board or by a member of the Board, upon application of a party or upon the Administrative Law Judge's or the Board member's own motion. In addition to or in lieu of these subpoenas, the Administrative Law Judge or the Board member may also issue an order directing the party or person under the control of a party to attend or produce.

(c) Conduct of Hearings by OATH. If the Board refers a hearing to OATH, a copy of the petition shall also be sent to OATH at the time the public servant is served with the petition. OATH shall conduct the hearing in accordance with its rules, as set forth in Title 48 of the Rules of the City of New York, except as otherwise provided by these rules.

(d) Conduct of Hearings by the Board or by a Board Member.

   (1) Generally. The Board may hear a case or may designate a member of the Board to hear a case, make findings of fact and conclusions of law, preside over pre-hearing matters and adjournments, and make recommendations to the Board for the proposed disposition of the proceeding. When a hearing is conducted by the Board, the hearing shall be presided over by the Board's Chair or by his or her designee. The Board or Board member shall conduct the hearing, including such pre-hearing matters as conferences, discovery, and motion practice, in conformance with the rules and procedures of OATH, as set forth in Title 48 of the Rules of the City of New York, except as otherwise provided by these rules.

   (2) Disposition Conferences and Agreements. If disposition of the proceeding is to be discussed at a conference, the Board shall designate an individual, other than a Board member participating in the hearing, to conduct the conference. During disposition discussions, upon notice to the parties, the person conducting the conference may confer with each party and/or representative separately. Board members shall not be called to testify in any proceeding concerning statements made at a disposition conference.

   (3) Order of Proceedings. Prosecuting counsel shall have the burden of proof by the preponderance of the evidence, shall initiate the presentation of evidence, and may present rebuttal evidence. The public servant may introduce evidence after prosecuting counsel has completed his or her case. Opening statements, if any, shall be made first by prosecuting counsel. Closing statements, if any, shall be made first by the public servant. This order of proceedings may be modified at the discretion of the Board or Board member.






*§ 2-04 Decisions and Orders.* ::


(a)  Report to the Board. When a hearing has been conducted by either OATH or a member of the Board designated to hear the case, a report of recommended findings of fact and conclusions of law and recommendations for the disposition of the proceeding shall be issued and forwarded, along with the original transcript of the proceeding and all documents introduced into the record, to the Board for review and final action. The report shall not be made public. A copy of the report and recommendation shall be sent to all parties and their counsel or other representative in order to afford them the opportunity to comment before final action is taken by the Board. If prosecuting counsel or the public servant wishes to comment, he or she shall do so within ten days of service of the report and recommendation.

(b) Finding of Violation. If after the hearing and upon a consideration of all the evidence in the record of hearing, including comments, the Board finds that a public servant has engaged in conduct prohibited by Chapter 68 of the City Charter, the Board shall consult with the head of the agency served or formerly served by the public servant, or in the case of an agency head, consult with the Mayor. Where the Board finds a violation of Chapter 68 or Section 12-110 of the Administrative Code, the Board shall state its final findings of fact and conclusions of law and issue an order imposing any penalties it deems appropriate under either statute. The order shall include notice of the public servant's right to appeal to the New York State Supreme Court. Alternatively, in the case of a violation of Chapter 68, the Board may state its findings and conclusions and recommend a penalty, if any, to the head of the agency served by the public servant or former public servant or, in the case of an agency head or former agency head, to the Mayor. Pursuant to Charter § 2604(h)(3), the Board shall not impose penalties against members of the City Council, or public servants employed by the City Council or by members of the City Council, but may state its findings and conclusions and recommend to the City Council such penalties as the Board deems appropriate. When a penalty is recommended, the head of the agency, Mayor, or City Council shall report to the Board what action was taken.

(c) Consultation by Agency. In instances where the Board does not hold a hearing and instead refers a matter to the public servant's agency, that agency shall consult with the Board prior to issuing its final decision.

(d) Dismissals. If, after the hearing and upon consideration of the record, the Board finds that a public servant has not engaged in acts prohibited by Chapter 68 of the City Charter or Section 12-110 of the Administrative Code, the Board shall state its findings of facts and conclusions of law and shall issue an order dismissing the petition. The order shall not be made public.






*§ 2-05 General Matters.* ::


(a)  Appearances before the Board.

   (1) A party may appear before the Board in person, by an attorney, or by a duly authorized representative. The person appearing for the party shall file a notice of appearance with the Board. The filing of any papers by an attorney or other representative who has not previously appeared shall constitute the filing of a notice of appearance by that person and shall conform to the requirements of paragraphs (2) and (4) of this subdivision.

   (2) The appearance of a member in good standing of the bar of a court of general jurisdiction of any state or territory of the United States shall be indicated by the suffix "Esq." and the designation "Attorney for (person represented)."

   (3) Absent extraordinary circumstances, no application shall be made or argued by any attorney or other representative who has not filed a notice of appearance.

   (4) A person may not file a notice of appearance on behalf of a party unless the person has been retained by that party to represent the party before the Board. Filing a notice of appearance constitutes a representation that the person appearing has been so retained.

Withdrawals shall not be granted unless upon consent of the client or when other cause exists, as delineated in the applicable provisions of the Code of Professional Responsibility.

   (2) Notices of substitution of counsel served and filed more than twenty days prior to a hearing before the Board or before a member of the Board may be filed without leave of the Board or Board member. Notices of substitution of counsel served and filed less than twenty-one days prior to a hearing before the Board or before a member of the Board may be filed only with the permission of the Board or Board member, which permission shall be freely given, absent prejudice or substantial delay of the proceedings.

(c) Service of Petition by Board. A petition shall be served on the public servant (i) in the manner provided in § 312-a, or subdivisions 1, 2, or 4 of § 308, of the New York Civil Practice Law and Rules for service of a summons or (ii) by both certified mail, return receipt requested, and first class mail to the public servant's last known residence or actual place of business or (iii) in such manner as the Board directs, if service is impracticable under paragraphs (i) and (ii) of this subdivision, or (iv) in any manner agreed upon by counsel to the Board and the public servant or his or her representative.

(d) Service of Other Documents by Board. Notices, orders, and all other documents, except petitions and subpoenas, originating with the Board shall be served on the public servant (i) by personal delivery to the public servant or (ii) by first class mail to the public servant's last known residence or actual place of business or (iii) by overnight delivery service to the public servant's last known residence or actual place of business or (iv) by telephonic facsimile (FAX) or similar transmission or (v) by leaving the paper at the public servant's last known residence with a person of suitable age and discretion or (vi) in such manner as the Board directs, if service is impracticable under paragraphs (i), (ii), (iii), (iv), or (v) of this subdivision, or (vii) in any manner agreed upon by counsel to the Board and the public servant or his or her representative. Where the public servant has appeared by a representative, all papers served by the Board subsequent to that appearance shall be served upon the representative by one of the methods provided in paragraphs (i)-(vii) of this subdivision.

(e) Computation of Time. The computation of any time period referred to in these rules shall be calculated in calendar days, except that when the last day of the time period is a Saturday, Sunday, or public holiday, the period shall run until the end of the next following business day. Where a period of time prescribed by the rules set forth in this chapter is measured from the service of a paper and service of that paper is made in the manner provided by paragraph (ii) of subdivision (a) or paragraph (ii) of subdivision (b) of this section, five days shall be added to the prescribed period.

(f) Confidentiality. All matters relating to complaints submitted to or inquired into by the Board, or any action taken by the Board in connection therewith or hearings conducted by the Board or OATH, shall be kept confidential unless the public servant waives confidentiality and the Board determines that confidentiality is not otherwise required. Hearings conducted by the Board or by OATH shall be public if requested by the public servant. Final findings, conclusions, and orders issued upon a violation of Chapter 68 shall be made public.

(g) Ex Parte Communications with Board.

   (1) After service of the petition in a case, counsel conducting the prosecution of the case on behalf of the Board shall not communicate ex parte with any member of the Board concerning the merits of the case, except as provided in paragraph (2) of this subdivision.

   (2) Counsel conducting the prosecution of a case on behalf of the Board may communicate ex parte with the Board, or any member thereof, with respect to ministerial matters involving the case or on consent of the respondent or respondent's counsel or in an emergency.

(h) Disposition by Agreement. At any time after the service of a notice of probable cause in a proceeding brought pursuant to Chapter 68 or at any time after service of a petition in a proceeding brought pursuant to § 12-110 of the Administrative Code, the public servant and the Board may agree to dispose of the case by agreement. For this purpose, the Board or any Board member designated by the Board may conduct a disposition conference, provided that, when the Board or a member of the Board conducts or is to conduct the hearing, the Board shall comply with the requirements of 53 RCNY § 2-03(d)(2). All offers of disposition, whether made at a conference, hearing, or otherwise, shall be confidential and shall be inadmissible at trial of any case. If a disposition by agreement is reached, it shall be reduced to writing and signed by the public servant or his or her representative and the Board or, in the discretion of the Board, placed on the record. When a disposition by agreement contains an acknowledgment that a public servant's conduct has violated a provision of Chapter 68 of the City Charter or § 12-110 of the Administrative Code, that disposition by agreement shall be made public by the Board.

(i) OATH Rules. In the event of any inconsistency between these rules and the rules of the Office of Administrative Trials and Hearings, these rules shall govern.

Multiple donations made by an individual in the same calendar year are considered in the aggregate for purposes of Administrative Code § 3-902(a)(7) and for purposes of obtaining the individual donor’s written submission pursuant to Administrative Code § 3-903(d).

   (4) In determining whether and when a donation must be returned pursuant to Administrative Code § 3-903(b), where a person is added to the City’s Doing Business Database in a calendar year and the donor or household members of the donor make multiple donations to the organization that in the aggregate exceed $400 in that calendar year, the date of receipt will be deemed to be the date that the aggregate donations for the calendar year among the donor and household members of the donor exceed $400.

   (5) To determine whether a donation may be accepted pursuant to Administrative Code §§ 3-903(a) and (b), and to comply with the reporting requirement of Administrative Code § 3-902(a)(6), a restricted organization must take the following steps to determine whether a donor was listed in the City’s Doing Business Database or was a household member of a person listed in the City’s Doing Business Database, either on the date of the donation or as of 180 days after the date of the donation:

      (ii) consult the organization’s records, including but not limited to donors’ written submissions collected pursuant to Administrative Code § 3-903(d), if any, to determine whether the donor was a household member of a person listed in the City’s Doing Business Database;

      (iii) consult each of the following people: (a) the organization’s affiliated elected official or the agent of the organization’s affiliated elected official who exercises control over the organization; (b) each board member of the organization; and (c) each principal officer of the organization.

The organization must obtain the names of the spouse or domestic partner of any such donor (or, if the donor is an unemancipated child, his or her parent) and check those names against the Doing Business Database; and

      (iv) if an organization concludes that a donor, a donor’s spouse or domestic partner (or, if a donor is an unemancipated child, his or her parent), is not a person with business dealings with the City, despite such person’s name matching the name of an individual in the Doing Business Database, the organization must submit information supporting that conclusion to the Board. The Board will review the submission and determine whether the donation may be accepted pursuant to Administrative Code §§ 3-903(a) or 3-903(b) and if it must be reported pursuant to Administrative Code § 3-902(a)(6).

The organization must request that each person consulted pursuant to this subparagraph review a list of the organization’s most recent donors and inform the organization if such person believes that a donor is listed in the Doing Business Database, or is the domestic partner, spouse, or unemancipated child of a person listed in the Doing Business Database. The organization must obtain the names of the spouse or domestic partner of any such donor (or, if the donor is an unemancipated child, his or her parent) and check those names against the Doing Business Database; and

      (iv) if an organization concludes a donor, a donor’s spouse or domestic partner (or, if a donor is an unemancipated child, his or her parent), is not a person with business dealings with the City, despite such person’s name matching the name of an individual in the Doing Business Database, the organization must submit information supporting that conclusion to the Board. The Board will review the submission and determine whether the donation must be reported pursuant to Administrative Code § 3-902(a)(6).

   (3) To comply with the reporting requirement of Administrative Code § 3-902(a)(7), an unrestricted organization must submit to the Board the names of any individuals who or entities that made a donation with a reasonable value of $1,000 or more, whether in a single donation or in multiple donations. If an unrestricted organization receives multiple donations from the same individual or entity, the aggregate value of which has a reasonable value of $1,000 or more, the organization must report the date and value of every donation from that individual or entity.

   (4) To comply with the reporting requirement of Administrative Code § 3-902(a)(8), an unrestricted organization must submit to the Board a list of each elected official communication created or distributed, which list must include a description, the date, and the total cost of each such communication. In calculating the total cost of an elected official communication, an unrestricted organization must include the value of all goods and services paid by the organization to create and distribute the elected official communication, including without limitation the value of the time of its employees and the value of all goods and services donated by a non-governmental source for the communication’s creation or distribution.

   (1) Pursuant to Administrative Code § 3-902(b), an organization affiliated with an elected official may submit a request to the Board that disclosure of one or more of its donors and/or the amount of donation not be made public. The organization must make such a request in writing no later than April 1 for the previous calendar year and must explain why the release of such information to the public may cause harm, threats, harassment, or reprisals to the donor, or to individuals or property affiliated with the donor.

   (2) Whether or not a reporting entity has submitted a request pursuant to this subdivision, the Board may upon its own initiative grant privacy as to any information submitted by an organization affiliated with an elected official, upon a finding by the Board that the release of such information would constitute a risk to the safety or security of any person.
