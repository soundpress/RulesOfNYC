§ 1-03 Restrictions on Use of Receipts. ::


	   (a)   Restriction on use. In addition to the restriction set forth in Rule 5-03(e)(2) and, except as otherwise provided in subdivision (b):
	
	      (1)   the candidate may expend, transfer, or use receipts, including receipts resulting from a sale, lease, or other transfer of assets, only to pay expenses incurred in that election; no receipts, including receipts accepted for another election, if any, deposited in a separate account as provided in Rule 2-06(b), may be expended, transferred, or used for any other purpose until any required repayments to the Fund have been made and any fines or civil penalties assessed pursuant to the Act have been paid;
	
	      (2)   receipts deposited in an account shall not be used for any purpose other than the election for which that account was established, pursuant to Rule 2-06(b), except as otherwise provided in Rule 2-06(c) for runoff primary election or runoff special election accounts;
	
	      (3)   after the participant first receives public funds for an election, the principal committee for that election may not make a transfer to a political committee not involved in that election until all unspent campaign funds from that election have been repaid;
	
	      (4)   after the participant first receives public funds for an election, the principal committee for that election may not make expenditures to pay expenses or debt from a previous election (other than a primary election held in the same calendar year).
	
	   (b)   Exception. After the first January 11 after an election, a candidate involved in that election may expend, transfer, or use receipts accepted for another election, provided that the receipts have been deposited in and are disbursed from a separate account, as provided in 52 RCNY § 2-06(b). Funds accepted and separately deposited for the previous election may be transferred to this account only after any required repayments to the Fund have been made and any fines or civil penalties assessed pursuant to the Act have been paid. Contributions and loans accepted for the previous election after such election are subject to 52RCNY §§ 1-04(m) and 1-05(g).




§ 1-04 Contributions. ::


	   (a)   Receipt. A monetary contribution is received on the date it is delivered. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a text message contribution is received on the date it is delivered to an authorized committee, after payment of the contributor's wireless bill, by a wireless carrier or other mobile fundraising vendor. An in-kind contribution is received on the date the goods or services are received or rendered. Candidates must report the date of receipt of each contribution that is accepted and deposited on disclosure statements filed with the Board.
	
	   (b)   Deposit. All monetary contributions must be accepted and deposited, or rejected and returned to a contributor, within 20 business days after receipt except contributions made in the form of cash must be accepted and deposited, or rejected and returned to a contributor, within 10 business days after receipt. All contributions that are accepted and deposited are subject to the Act's contribution limits and prohibitions and must be reported to the Board. If a candidate returns a contribution after its deposit, the return must be reported to the Board.
	
	   (c)   Returning receipts.
	
	      (1)   Excess and prohibited contributions. When a candidate knows or has reason to know that he or she has accepted a contribution, contributions, or aggregate contributions from a single source in excess of the applicable contribution limit, including a contribution or contributions from a contributor having business dealings with the city, or from a source prohibited by the Act or the Charter, the candidate shall promptly return the excess portion or prohibited contribution, as the case may be, by bank check or certified check made out to the contributor; provided, however, that in the case of a contribution from a contributor having business dealings with the city in excess of the applicable limitation set forth in § 3-703(1-a) of the Code, the candidate shall return the excess portion of such contribution within 20 days of receipt of notice from the Board that the contribution exceeds such limitation. Alternatively, if return of the contribution to the contributor is impracticable, the candidate may pay to the Fund an amount equal to the amount of the prohibited contribution or the excess portion, as the case may be. Remedial actions taken pursuant to this rule will not, however, preclude imposition of a penalty under the Act; provided, however, that no violation shall issue and no penalty shall be imposed where the excess portion of a contribution from a contributor having business dealings with the city is postmarked or delivered within 20 days of receipt of notification from the Board. The Board shall provide such notification to the candidate within 20 days of the reporting of the contribution, or, in the case of a contribution reported during the six weeks preceding the candidate's next covered election, the Board shall provide such notification within 3 business days; provided, however, that if such twentieth day is a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday, notification by the Board by 5 p.m. on the next business day shall be considered timely. If the candidate demonstrates to the Board, within 20 days of receipt of such notice, that the contributor identified by the Board as having business dealings with the city has applied to the Mayor's Office of Contract Services or the City Clerk for removal from the doing business database and that such application is pending, the candidate may retain contribution(s) received from such contributor until the Board notifies the candidate that the Mayor's Office of Contract Services or the City Clerk has denied the application for removal, in which case the candidate shall have 20 days from receipt of such second notice to return the excess portion of the contribution(s). Contributions from contributors who have applied for removal from the doing business database shall not be considered matchable contributions unless and until the contributor is removed from the doing business database by the Mayor's Office of Contract Services or the City Clerk. A candidate may not accept any contributions in excess of the applicable contribution limits or from sources prohibited by the Act or the Charter.
	
	      (2)   Restrictions on return. After receiving public funds for an election, a participant may not return a contribution, unless directed by the Board to do so, until any required repayments to the Fund have been made, except if the contribution: (i) exceeds the contribution limit, including the limit applicable to contributors having business dealings with the City, (ii) is otherwise illegal, (iii) is returned because of the particular source or intermediary involved, or (iv) was deposited in a separate account, pursuant to Rule 2-06(c) for a runoff election that is not held.
	
	   (d)   Contributions from political committees.
	
	      (1)   Pursuant to § 3-703(1)(k) of the Code, a participant may not accept a contribution from a political committee, unless the political committee has registered with the Board pursuant to § 3-707 of the Code for the period that includes the participant's next covered election or so registers within ten days of receipt of the contribution. The registration shall be submitted in such form and manner as shall be determined by the Board and shall include such information as may be required by the Board, including:
	
	         (i)   the name and address of the committee, and the name, address, and employer of the chairperson, treasurer, and liaison of the committee;
	
	         (ii)   an indication whether the committee is a political action committee, a candidate committee (and if so, identification of the candidate(s) supported by the committee), or another kind of political committee;
	
	         (iii)   identification of the governmental agency or agencies with which the committee files its financial disclosure statements;
	
	         (iv)   an indication whether the committee makes monetary contributions, in-kind contributions, and/or independent expenditures, and the name, address and employer of each person with the authority to determine the candidates for whom the committee makes contributions and/or independent expenditures; and
	
	         (v)   an indication whether the committee accepts contributions from corporations, limited liability companies, or partnerships and undertakes not to use funds from such entities for contributions to participants.
	
	      (2)   The registration shall remain in effect through the January 11 following the next regularly scheduled citywide election, unless there has been a material change in the information included in the registration. In the event of a material change, an amendment to the registration shall be filed in order to keep the registration in effect. The Board shall establish a procedure for renewing a previous registration for the next election cycle.
	
	      (3)   It is the responsibility of the participant to determine whether a contribution from a political committee may be accepted. Participants have the burden to check the cumulative list of registered political committees, published by the Board on a daily basis on its Web site, to ensure that each political committee contribution accepted is from a political committee that registered with the Board previously or within ten days after the acceptance of the contribution. The participant has the burden of demonstrating why a contribution from a political committee that had not registered in a timely manner has been retained.
	
	   (e)   Corporations, limited liability companies, and partnerships. Candidates may not accept, directly, indirectly, or by transfer, contributions, loans, guarantees or other security for a loan from a corporation, limited liability company, or partnership, including a limited liability partnership or professional corporation. This prohibition does not apply to loans made in the regular course of business, regardless of the lender's form of business entity; but does prohibit the acceptance of a guarantee or other security for such a loan from a corporation, limited liability company, or partnership. This prohibition does not apply to contributions by political committees that are corporations, limited liability companies, or partnerships.
	
	   (f)   Attributing a contribution to an election. A contribution is presumed to be accepted for the first election in which the participant, limited participant, or non-participant is a candidate following the day that it is received, except:
	
	      (1)   as otherwise provided in 52 RCNY §§ 1-04(c)(2), 1-04(m), and 1-07;
	
	      (2)   in the case of a State or local election, contributions received before the first January 12 after an election will also be presumed to be accepted for that election; and
	
	      (3)   in the case of a federal election contributions received before the first January 1 after the election will also be presumed to be accepted for that election, except as may otherwise be provided under federal law and regulations.
	
	   (g)   In-kind contributions.
	
	      (1)   As expenditures. An in-kind contribution to a candidate is also an expenditure made by the candidate. The date an in-kind contribution is received is also the date of its expenditure. If a debt, other than a loan, incurred by a candidate is forgiven, the act of forgiving is an in-kind contribution to but not an expenditure by the candidate.
	
	      (2)   Valuation. The candidate shall use a reasonable estimate of fair market value in determining the monetary value of an in-kind contribution and shall maintain a receipt or other written record supporting the valuation. "Fair market value" for goods means the price of those goods in the market from which they ordinarily would have been purchased at the time the goods are received. "Fair market value" for services, other than those provided by an unpaid volunteer, means the hourly or piecework charge for the services at a commercially reasonable rate prevailing at the time the services were rendered.
	
	      (3)   Goods and services provided at a price below fair market value. If goods or services are provided at less than fair market value, the amount of the resulting in-kind contribution is the difference between the fair market value of the goods or services at the time the goods or services are received and the amount charged to the candidate.
	
	      (4)   Extensions of credit.
	
	         (i)   Generally. A creditor who extends credit to a candidate for a period beyond 90 days, has made a contribution equal in value to the credit extended, unless the creditor has made a commercially reasonable attempt to collect the debt.
	
	         (ii)   Corporate, limited liability company, and partnership vendors. Notwithstanding subparagraph (i), if a candidate demonstrates that a creditor that is a corporation, limited liability company, or partnership did not intend to make a contribution, the extension of credit will not result by itself in the candidate being deemed to have accepted a contribution from a corporation, limited liability company, or partnership, as prohibited by law.
	
	         (iii)   Loans. This paragraph does not apply to loans.
	
	      (5)   Debts forgiven. A debt owed by a candidate which is forgiven or settled for less than the amount owed is a contribution, unless the debt was forgiven or settled by a creditor who has treated the outstanding debt in a commercially reasonable manner.
	
	      (6)   Commercially reasonable treatment of debts. The Board will consider as evidence of commercially reasonable treatment that:
	
	         (i)   all commercially reasonable efforts have been taken to satisfy the outstanding debt; and
	
	         (ii)   the creditor has pursued its remedies in the same manner as that employed by creditors of other debtors, including the institution of lawsuits.
	
	      (7)   Failure to report liability. Notwithstanding any implication of paragraph (4) to the contrary, a candidate's failure to report an outstanding liability in a contemporaneous manner is a violation of § 3-703(6) of the Code. Such a liability will be deemed an in-kind contribution.
	
	   (h)   Multiple contributions from a single source. If a candidate accepts more than one contribution from a single source, the contributions shall be totaled to determine the candidate's compliance with the applicable contribution limit. A "single source" includes any person, persons in combination, or entity who or which establishes, maintains, or controls another entity and every entity so established, maintained, or controlled, including every political committee established, maintained, or controlled by the same person, persons in combination, or entity. If a candidate accepts multiple contributions from a single source consisting of at least one contribution from a person having business dealings with the city and one or more contributions from an entity established, maintained, or controlled by that person, the applicable contribution limit shall be the limit applicable to persons having business dealings with the city pursuant to § 3-703(1-a) of the Code.
	
	      (1)   General factors. Factors for determining whether a person, persons in combination, or an entity establishes, maintains, or controls another entity include, but are not limited to:
	
	         (i)   whether the person or entity makes decisions or establishes policy for the other entity, including determinations of the recipients of its contributions and the purposes of its expenditures;
	
	         (ii)   whether the person or entity has the authority to hire, appoint, discipline, discharge, demote, remove, or otherwise influence other persons who make decisions or establish policies for the other entity;
	
	         (iii)   whether contributions made by the person or entity and the other entity reflect a similar pattern; and
	
	         (iv)   whether the person or entity knows of and has acquiesced in public representations by the other entity that it is acting on its behalf or under its direction.
	
	      (2)   Labor organizations. Notwithstanding paragraph (1), different labor organizations shall not be considered to be a single source for the purpose of compliance with the applicable contribution limit if the candidate demonstrates that the contributors satisfy the four criteria below:
	
	         (i)   the labor organizations do not share a majority of members of their governing boards;
	
	         (ii)   the labor organizations do not share a majority of the officers of their governing boards;
	
	         (iii)   the labor organizations maintain separate accounts with different signatories; and
	
	         (iv)   the labor organizations make contributions from separate accounts.
	
	      (3)   It is the responsibility of the candidate to determine whether a contribution exceeds the applicable contribution limit. To ensure that the candidate does not accept a contribution exceeding the applicable limit, the candidate must review the relationship between affiliated contributors before the candidate accepts and deposits their contributions or rejects and returns the contributions under Rule 1-04(b) and (c). The candidate has the burden of demonstrating why the candidate has retained an over-the-limit contribution from contributors who or which constitute a single source.
	
	   (i)   [Reserved.]
	
	   (j)   Earmarked contributions. If a candidate accepts from a political committee a contribution that had been given to the committee by a contributor who limits the political committee's choice or directs the selection of the recipient, the contribution shall be considered to be from both the original contributor and from the political committee. This rule does not apply to political committees acting solely as intermediaries and not exercising any discretion over the selection of the ultimate recipient, or to political committees making contributions from funds that have not been earmarked by the contributors. Nothing in this subdivision shall be construed to modify the requirements of New York Election Law § 14-120.
	
	   (k)   Joint contributions.
	
	      (1)   Except as otherwise provided for in subdivisions (i) or (j), no contribution shall be considered to be made by more than one person or entity, unless the check or other monetary instrument representing the contribution includes the signature of each person making the contribution (or authorized person in the case of an entity making a contribution).
	
	      (2)   If a check or other monetary instrument representing a joint contribution does not indicate the amount to be attributed to each contributor, the contribution shall be attributed equally to each contributor.
	
	   (l)   Tickets for fund-raising events. The entire amount paid to attend a fund-raising event and the entire amount paid as the purchase price for a fund-raising item sold by a candidate are contributions.
	
	   (m)   Post-election contributions. Contributions accepted after an election may be used to pay liabilities incurred in that election subject to the applicable contribution limit and prohibitions, only if deposited in and disbursed from an account established and maintained for that election, as provided in 52 RCNY § 2-06(b).
	
	   (n)   Solicitation of contributions for elections not subject to the Act. If a candidate makes a solicitation for a contribution for an election not subject to the requirements of the Act, the solicitation must specify that the contribution is being solicited for an election that is not subject to the requirements of the Act.
	
	   (o)   Court-ordered rerun elections. Candidates may not accept additional contributions permitted for a court-ordered rerun election pursuant to § 3-703(1)(f) of the Code before the canvass of returns in, or conduct of, the preceding election is contested in a court of competent jurisdiction. If a rerun election is ordered by a court but subsequently cancelled, a candidate who would have been on the ballot has the burden of demonstrating that any portion of contributions in excess of the limit applicable under § 3-703(1)(f) of the Code may be reasonably attributed to expenses incurred for the rerun election before its cancellation.
	
	   (p)   Joint fundraising; endorsements.
	
	      (1)   If a candidate makes expenditures in connection with, or otherwise cooperates in, raising contributions for any other candidate or political committee:
	
	         (i)   the expenditures incurred and in-kind contributions received in connection with such fundraising, including in the form of endorsements, shall be allocated in accordance with Rule 1-08(h); and
	
	         (ii)   if any of the contributions so raised is:
	
	   (A)   in an amount that exceeds the amount of the contribution limit applicable to the candidate under § 3-703(1)(f) of the Code (including when aggregated with contributions the candidate receives from the same source); or
	
	   (B)   from a source that would be prohibited to the candidate by the Act or the Charter; the candidate shall have the burden of demonstrating that the contribution was not used in a manner that directly or indirectly assisted or benefitted the candidate in violation of the applicable limit or prohibition. This paragraph shall not be construed to prohibit a candidate from making a monetary contribution to any other candidate or political committee, provided, however, that such contributions may result in reduced public funds payments pursuant to 52 RCNY § 5-01(n).
	
	      (2)   To ensure compliance with the contribution limits of § 3-703(1)(f) of the Code, candidates who run together as a "ticket," and make joint expenditures to raise contributions, shall additionally abide by the requirements of this subdivision.
	
	         (i)   When paying his or her share of joint expenditures (by direct payment or reimbursement), the payor shall have the burden of demonstrating that the amount disbursed does not derive from contributions that would exceed the other candidate's contribution limit, if those contributions were aggregated with contributions previously received by the other candidate.
	
	         (ii)   Therefore, no disbursement for joint expenditures shall be made before the candidate is able to account fully for the disbursement with contributions that would not exceed the other candidate's contribution limit, if so aggregated. Failure to make reimbursement within 30 days of the expenditure, however, will result in a deduction in public funds payments otherwise due to the candidate to be reimbursed, pursuant to 52 RCNY § 5-01(n)(1), and failure to make reimbursement within 90 days will result in treatment of the expenditure as an in-kind contribution to the candidate failing to make reimbursement, pursuant to 52 RCNY § 1-04(g)(4).
	
	   (q)   Anticipated runoff primary or runoff special elections. A candidate seeking the nomination of a political party or seeking election in a special election may not accept contributions for a runoff primary election or runoff special election, unless the candidate has previously demonstrated to the Board that a runoff election is reasonably anticipated. Runoff election contributions may not be accepted once it is no longer reasonable to anticipate such a runoff election. To the extent permitted by this subdivision, the candidate (and each opposing candidate seeking the same party nomination or seeking election in the same special election, as the case may be) may solicit and accept additional contributions for the anticipated runoff election, up to the amount permitted for the runoff election by § 3-703(1)(f) of the Code, under the following conditions:
	
	      (1)   every runoff election contribution shall be deposited in a separate account and subject to restrictions on use, as provided in Rule 2-06(c);
	
	      (2)   until a primary or special election is held that results in a runoff election, each solicitation of runoff election contributions shall expressly state that such contributions are being solicited only for a runoff election that may not occur;
	
	      (3)   no single contribution check shall be accepted in an amount that exceeds the limit applicable for the primary and general election, or special election, under § 3-703(1)(f) or (h) of the Code; and
	
	      (4)   each disclosure statement submitted by the candidate shall include a copy of the most recent bank statement for its runoff election account.
	
	   (r)   Contributions by minors.
	
	      (1)   A participant or non-participant may accept a contribution from a minor child (individual under 18 years of age) only if: (i) the decision to contribute was made knowingly and voluntarily by the minor child; (ii) the funds, goods, or services contributed were owned and controlled exclusively by the minor child, such as income earned by the child, or a bank account opened and maintained exclusively in the child's name; and (iii) the contribution was not made from the proceeds of a gift, the purpose of which was to provide funds to be contributed.
	
	      (2)   Contributions by individuals under 18 years of age shall not be matchable.
	
	   (s)   Candidates may not accept a contribution in violation of state or federal law.
	
	




§ 1-05 Loans. ::


	   (a)   Repayment by next election. A loan, must be repaid by the date of the next election, or else the loan, guarantee, or other security for a loan will be considered a contribution subject to the Act's contribution limits.
	
	   (b)   Loans not made in regular course of business. A loan not made in the regular course of the lender's business shall be deemed, to the extent not repaid to the lender by the date of the next election, a contribution by the lender.
	
	   (c)   Loans made in regular course of business. A loan made in the regular course of the lender's business shall be deemed, to the extent not repaid by the date of the next election, a contribution by the obligor on the loan and by any other person endorsing, cosigning, guaranteeing, collaterizing, or otherwise providing security for the loan. Neither the Act nor the Charter prohibits receipt of a loan made in the regular course of the lender's business, regardless whether the lender is a corporation, limited liability company, or partnership.
	
	   (d)   Third party repays loan. If any portion of a loan is repaid by a person or entity other than the participant or non-participant receiving the loan, the portion thus repaid shall be a contribution by that person or entity.
	
	   (e)   [Reserved.]
	
	   (f)   [Reserved.]
	
	   (g)   Post-election loans. Loans received after an election that are used for that election are considered contributions for that election, and must be deposited in and disbursed from an account established and maintained for that election, as provided in 52 RCNY § 2-06(b), except that a loan made by the candidate after the election for the purpose of (i) paying penalties pursuant to the Act or (ii) making required repayments to the Fund is not subject to the contribution limit.
	
	   (h)   Attributing a loan to an election. A loan is presumed to be accepted for the first election in which the participant or non-participant is a candidate following the day that the loan is received, except:
	
	      (1)   as otherwise provided in 52 RCNY § 1-05(g);
	
	      (2)   in the case of a State or local election, loans received before the first January 12 after an election will also be presumed to be accepted for that election; and
	
	      (3)   in the case of a Federal election, loans received before the first January 1 after the election will also be presumed to be accepted for that election, except as may otherwise be provided under Federal law and regulations.
	
	         (i)   Deposit. All loans must be accepted and deposited, or rejected and returned, within 10 business days after receipt.
	
	   (j)   Loans forgiven. Any portion of a loan that is forgiven is a monetary contribution.




§ 1-06 Special Elections. ::


	If a special election to fill a vacancy is declared, the Board may provide for the following special requirements and procedures for candidates in the special election, after considering the date of the election and any other relevant factors:
	
	   (a)   a standard by which contributions, loans, and/or expenditures are presumed to be accepted or made for the special election, notwithstanding 52 RCNY §§ 1-04(f), 1-05(h), and 1-08(c)(1);
	
	   (b)   a standard for determining the total amount of surplus funds from previous elections and
	
	   (c)   such other requirements and procedures as the Board may deem necessary to implement the provisions of the Act in the special election fully and effectively.




§ 1-07 Funds Originally Received for Other Elections. ::


	   (a)    Use. Funds originally received by a committee not otherwise involved in a covered election may be used in a covered election subject to the requirements of this rule, but may not be claimed as matchable contributions for that election.
	
	   (b)   Surplus funds. The Board deems the cash balance reported in the candidate's first semi-annual form or Board disclosure statement at the beginning of the first reporting period for an election to be the total amount of surplus funds the committee had from a previous election; except that the amount deemed to be surplus funds may be reduced by the following:
	
	      (1)   the total amount of debts and obligations outstanding at the beginning of the reporting period;
	
	      (2)   the total amount subsequently transferred to a political committee that is not involved in a covered election; and
	
	      (3)   if the candidate was a participant in the previous election, the total amount of public funds subsequently repaid. When requested by the Board, candidates shall provide additional information regarding totals and transactions reported in State forms or Board disclosure statements.
	
	   (c)   Contribution limit; prohibited contributions. Candidates have the burden of demonstrating that surplus funds and transfers of funds from committees not otherwise involved in the covered election do not derive from: (1) contributions in excess of the Act's contribution limits, including contributions that would exceed the Act's contribution limits when aggregated with other contributions accepted from the same source; or (2) contributions from sources prohibited by the Act or the Charter. In addition, participants have the burden of demonstrating that funds transferred from a committee, other than another authorized committee of the same candidate that has filed contemporaneous disclosure statements with the board in a timely manner, derive solely from contributions for which records demonstrating the contributors' intent to designate the contributions for the covered election have been submitted and maintained as required, pursuant to 52 RCNY § 3-03(c)(2) and 52 RCNY § 4-01(b)(4), respectively.
	
	   For purposes of enforcing the contribution limit and contribution prohibitions, the Board shall attribute surplus funds and such transfers to the last monetary contributions, loans, and other receipts received by: (1) the candidate on or before the date of the cash balance described in subdivision (b) in the case of surplus funds; or (2) the transferor committee before making the transfer. The candidate shall either promptly return the portion of any contribution that exceeds the Act's contribution limit or violates a prohibition of the Act or the Charter, as provided in 52 RCNY § 1-04(c)(1), or deposit the excess portion or amount of the prohibited contribution, as the case may be, into a separate account not to be used in a covered election.
	
	   (d)   Related expenditures. Expenditures made in connection with raising or administering funds transferred from a committee not otherwise involved in a covered election are subject to the expenditure limits of the Act and shall be reported as provided in 52 RCNY § 3-03(c)(2). As provided for in 52 RCNY § 1-08(o), the participant shall have the burden of demonstrating that any expenditures incurred by the transferor committee are not subject to the expenditure limits of the Act.
	
	




§ 1-08 Expenditures. ::


	   (a)    Expenditures. Expenditures include all disbursements made, liabilities incurred, and contributions received by a candidate, except disbursements to return contributions, repay loans, return public funds, and transfers. Some expenditures are subject to the expenditure limits of the Act and other expenditures are exempt.
	
	   (b)   Making an expenditure. As provided and described in § 3-706 (1) and (2) of the Code, an expenditure for goods or services is made when the goods or services are received, used, or rendered, regardless when payment is made. Expenditures for goods or services received, used, or rendered in more than one year shall be attributed in a reasonable manner to the expenditure limits of § 3-706(1) or (2) of the Code, as appropriate.
	
	      (1)   Expenditures for campaign advertising or other campaign communications shall be attributed to the expenditure limit in effect when the advertisement or communication is distributed, broadcast, or published. For the purposes of this paragraph, “campaign advertising or other campaign communications” shall not include a campaign website. A communication that is mailed shall be considered to have been “distributed” on the date on which it was postmarked.
	
	      (2)   Expenditures for services performed or deliverables provided over a period that includes both the primary and the general elections shall be attributed in a reasonable manner to the expenditure limits of § 3-706(1) and (2) of the Code, as appropriate.
	
	      (3)   Notwithstanding the requirements of this subdivision, the Board may require a candidate to demonstrate that an expenditure should be attributed to the expenditure limit provided in § 3-706(1) or (2) of the Code, as appropriate, based on the timing, nature, and purpose of the expenditure.
	
	   (c)   Attributing an expenditure to an election.
	
	      (1)   An expenditure is presumed to be made for the first election (in which the participant, limited participant or non-participant is a candidate) following the day it is made, except: (i) in the case of a State or local election, expenditures made before the first January 12 after an election will also be presumed to be made for that election; (ii) in the case of a federal election, expenditures made before the first January 1 after the election will also be presumed to be made for that election, except as may otherwise be provided under federal law and regulations.
	
	      (2)   (i)  If there is no contested primary election for an office, expenditures made by a participant or limited participant seeking that office are subject to the general election expenditure limit of § 3-706(1) of the Code.
	
	         (ii)   If there is a contested or write-in primary election in any party for an office, every participant or limited participant seeking that office, regardless whether the participant or limited participant is in the primary election, may make expenditures subject to the primary election expenditure limit of § 3-706(1) of the Code, provided the participant or limited participant files the three pre-primary and 10 day post-primary election disclosure statements and daily disclosures pursuant to Rule 3-02(c), (d), and (e) in a timely manner. In this case, the general election expenditure limit will first apply after the date of the primary election.
	
	         (iii)   Notwithstanding subparagraph (i), if a participant or limited participant demonstrates to the Board that for a period preceding the primary election the participant or limited participant had reasonably anticipated a primary election in any party for the office the participant or limited participant seeks, the participant or limited participant may attribute expenditures made before and during that period to the primary election expenditure limit of § 3-706(1) of the Code, provided the participant or limited participant files the three pre-primary and 10 day post-primary election disclosure statements and daily disclosures pursuant to Rule 3-02(c), (d), and (e) in a timely manner. In this case, the general election expenditure limit will first apply after that period. In order to demonstrate to the Board that for a period preceding the primary election the participant or limited participant had reasonably anticipated a primary election, the participant or limited participant must file a petition, consisting of an affidavit with supporting documentation, with the Board no later than ten business days following the date the last remaining candidate other than the participant or limited participant was finally disqualified from the ballot as set forth in Rule 5-02(b). The affidavit must specify the period of time during which it was reasonable to anticipate that a primary election would be held, identify the prospective candidate(s), and provide a factual basis for the participant's or limited participant's belief that a primary election was reasonably anticipated during the specified period of time. The supporting documentation must demonstrate that the prospective candidate(s) engaged in activities that would lead a reasonable person to believe that such candidate(s) would participate in the primary election. Such activities may include: (i) raising or spending funds for the primary election; (ii) authorizing a political committee with the Board of Elections for the primary election; (iii) filing a filer registration and/or certification form with the Board; (iv) engaging in petitioning activity, including the filing of petitions with the Board of Elections; (v) producing and/or distributing campaign literature; and (vi) campaigning for office or otherwise publicly declaring an intent to participate in the primary election.
	
	         (iv)   Once it is determined by petition litigation or otherwise that no primary election will be held for nomination to an office, expenditures made by participants or limited participant seeking that office are subject to the general election expenditure limit of § 3-706(1) of the Code.
	
	         (v)   Expenditures made before the primary election by a participant or limited participant who is a candidate in a contested primary election are subject to the primary election expenditure limits of § 3-706(1) of the Code, regardless whether the participant or limited participant has also received the nomination of another party without a primary election.
	
	      (3)   Candidates have the burden of demonstrating that expenditures made by committees reported not to be involved in the election in which the candidate is currently a participant or limited participant were not made in connection with such election. Failure to meet this burden will result in the application of all Program requirements to these committees for such election.
	
	      (4)   Special elections. An expenditure is presumed to be subject to the special election expenditure limit on and after the date a special election was first reasonably anticipated, as determined by the Board. Participants or limited participants may present evidence to the Board demonstrating the date a special election was first reasonably anticipated.
	
	   (d)   Expenditure limits.
	
	      (1)   All expenditures made by a participant or limited participant for the purpose of promoting or facilitating his or her nomination or election, including expenditures made for the purpose of promoting or facilitating the defeat of an opponent or prospective opponent, are subject to the expenditure limit applicable under the Act. All expenditures made by the participant or limited participant and his or her principal committee shall be totaled to determine the participant's or limited participant's compliance with the applicable expenditure limit. Expenditures made after the last election in an election year in which the participant or limited participant is a candidate, or a special election, are not subject to the expenditure limits for that election.
	
	      (2)   A participant or limited participant is permitted to make expenditures in excess of the limits of § 3-706(2) of the Code, but not in excess of the limits of § 3-706(1) of the Code. The limits of § 3-706(2) are the minimum amounts that a participant or limited participant must spend during the three calendar years before the election year in order to spend the total aggregate amount the Act and these Rules permit during those years and the time period encompassed by the expenditure limit that first applies to the candidate in the election year, pursuant to § 3-706(1) of the Code.
	
	      (3)   All expenditures made by a participant or limited participant for the purpose of advocating a vote for or against a proposal on the ballot in an election that is also a covered election, regardless whether the expenditures were also made to promote or facilitate the participant's nomination or election, shall be subject to the expenditure limits applicable in such covered election.
	
	      (4)   Exempt expenses.
	
	         (i)   The following shall not be subject to the expenditure limits:
	
	            (A)   expenses made for the purpose of bringing or responding to any action, proceeding, claim or suit before any court or arbitrator or administrative agency to determine a candidate's or political committee's compliance with the requirements of this chapter, including eligibility for public funds payments, or pursuant to or with respect to election law or other law or regulation governing candidate or political committee activity or ballot status;
	
	            (B)   expenses to challenge or defend the validity of petitions of designation or nomination or certificates of nomination, acceptance, authorization, declination or substitution, and expenses related to the canvassing or re-canvassing of election results; and
	
	            (C)   expenses related to the post-election audit, except as provided in subparagraph (ii) of this paragraph.
	
	         (ii)   Exempt expenses related to the post-election audit shall include pre-election expenses for organizing and copying existing records in preparation for submission during the post-election audit, but shall not include pre-election expenses for:
	
	            (A)   Ordinary compliance activities, such as the review of records to identify missing documents, evaluating whether documents meet Board standards, and identifying, preventing, and correcting any potential violation;
	
	            (B)   Post-election work for which an invoice is issued or paid prior to the election;
	
	            (C)   Salaries or other payments to campaign managers, finance chairpersons, treasurers, accountants, advisors, or other consultants;
	
	            (D)   Legal or accounting fees;
	
	            (E)   Costs associated with record creation and retention;
	
	            (F)   Costs associated with running an office or business, such as standard bookkeeping, maintaining checkbook registers, petty cash journals, bank records, and loan records;
	
	            (G)   Bookkeeping for payroll or vendor payments; and
	
	            (H)   Other standard practices that political committees routinely perform as entities that raise and spend funds.
	
	   (e)   Expenditure limit relief.
	
	         (i)   Pursuant to § 3-706(3)(a) of the Code, where the Board has determined that a non-participating candidate has spent or contracted or has obligated to spend, or received in loans or contributions, or both, an amount which, in the aggregate, exceeds half the applicable expenditure limit pursuant to § 3-706(1)(a) of the Code, then the expenditure limit applicable to participating candidates and limited participating candidates in the election for that office will be increased to one hundred fifty percent of the expenditure limit.
	
	         (ii)   Pursuant to § 3-706(3)(b) of the Code, where the Board has determined that a non-participating candidate has spent or contracted or has obligated to spend, or received in loans or contributions, or both, an amount which, in the aggregate, exceeds three times the applicable expenditure limit pursuant to § 3-706(1)(b) of the Code, then the expenditure limit will no longer apply to participating candidates and limited participating candidates in the election for that office.
	
	   (f)   Independent expenditures.
	
	      (1)   In determining whether an expenditure is independent, the Board may consider any of the factors from the following non-exhaustive list:
	
	         (i)   whether the person or entity making the expenditure is also an agent of a candidate;
	
	         (ii)   whether any person authorized to accept receipts or make expenditures for the person or entity making the expenditure is also an agent of a candidate;
	
	         (iii)   whether a candidate has authorized, requested, suggested, fostered, or otherwise cooperated in any way in the formation or operation of the person or entity making the expenditure;
	
	         (iv)   whether the person or entity making the expenditure has been established, financed, maintained, or controlled by any of the same persons or entities as those that have established, financed, maintained, or controlled a political committee authorized by the candidate;
	
	         (v)   whether the candidate shares or rents space for a campaign-related purpose with or from the person or entity making the expenditure;
	
	         (vi)   whether the candidate has solicited or collected funds on behalf of the person or entity making the expenditure, during the same election cycle in which the expenditure is made;
	
	         (vii)   whether the candidate, or any public or private office held or entity controlled by the candidate, including any governmental agency, division, or office, has retained the professional services of the person making the expenditure or a principal member or professional or managerial employee of the entity making the expenditure, during the same election cycle in which the expenditure is made; and
	
	         (viii)   whether the candidate and the person or entity making the expenditure have each consulted or otherwise been in communication with the same third party or parties, if the candidate knew or should have known that the candidate's communication or relationship to the third party or parties would inform or result in expenditures to benefit the candidate.
	
	      (2)   Upon consideration of the factors described in subsection (1), the Board may determine by a preponderance of evidence that an expenditure was not independent. Prior to such determination, the candidate and/or the person or entity making the expenditure shall have an opportunity to provide evidence indicating that such expenditure was independent.
	
	      (3)   Financing the dissemination, distribution, or republication of any broadcast or any written, graphic, or other form of campaign materials prepared by a candidate is a contribution to, and an expenditure by, the candidate, unless this activity was not in any way undertaken, authorized, requested, suggested, fostered, or otherwise cooperated in by the candidate.
	
	      (4)   An expenditure for the purpose of promoting or facilitating the nomination or election of a candidate, which is determined not to be an independent expenditure, is a contribution to, and an expenditure by, the candidate.
	
	      (5)   (i)   Communication between, or common agents shared by, parties and their nominees will not require a conclusion that all spending by the party's constituted committees and party committees in an election is an in-kind contribution to the nominee. The following expenditures made by party committees or constituted committees are not considered in-kind contributions to a candidate unless it is demonstrated that the candidate in some way cooperated in the expenditure and that the expenditure was intended to benefit that candidate:
	
	            (A)   materials or activities that promote the party, or oppose another party, by name, platform, principles, history, theme, slogans, issues, or philosophy, without reference to particular candidates in an upcoming election subject to the requirements of the Act.
	
	            (B)   materials or activities in connection with candidates and elections not subject to the requirements of the Act.
	
	            (C)   training, compensating, or providing materials for poll watchers appointed by the party pursuant to New York Election Law § 8-500.
	
	            (D)   promoting party enrollment or voter turnout without reference to particular candidates in an upcoming election subject to Program requirements, including research, polling, recruitment of party employees and volunteers, and development and maintenance of voter and contributor lists.
	
	            (E)   raising funds for the party without reference to particular candidates in an upcoming election subject to the requirements of the Act.
	
	            (F)   mailing of absentee ballot applications in a special or general election in which an office not subject to the requirements of the Act is on the ballot.
	
	         (ii)   The Board may require a candidate to demonstrate in any proceeding before the Board that any of the following expenditures that are made by a party committee or constituted committee are not in-kind contributions to the candidate:
	
	            (A)   expenditures for materials or activity that include an electioneering message about a clearly identified candidate for a covered election.
	
	            (B)   expenditures for advertisements, broadcasting, mailings, or electronic media for a candidate or against his or her opponent, including a home page on the Internet.
	
	            (C)   expenditures for which the candidate has, without making public disclosure of an outstanding liability in a timely manner, promised or made reimbursement or other payment to the party committee or constituted committee. These expenditures will be considered in-kind contributions during the time preceding the reimbursement or other payment by the candidate.
	
	      (6)   If candidates announce they are running together as a "ticket" for which they have chosen to join together in a broad spectrum of activities to promote each other's election, the Board will presume that expenditures made by one candidate's campaign for materials or activities that clearly identify the other candidate are in-kind contributions to the second candidate. The following factors would increase the burden a candidate would have in overcoming this presumption: (i) the campaigns have staff, consultants, office space, or telephone lines in common; (ii) other in-kind contributions, expenditure refunds, advances, or joint expenditures have been made between these campaigns. If the expenditures are in-kind contributions, the expenditures are subject to the apportionment requirements of Rule 1-08(h).
	
	   (g)   Spending public funds.
	
	      (1)   Public funds may be used only for expenditures by a participant's principal committee to further the participant's nomination or election either in a special election to fill a vacancy or during the calendar year in which the election in which the candidate is a participant is held.
	
	      (2)   Public funds may not be used for:
	
	         (i)   an expenditure for any purpose other than the furtherance of the participant's nomination or election;
	
	         (ii)   an expenditure not incurred during the calendar year of the election;
	
	         (iii)   an expenditure in violation of any law;
	
	         (iv)   payments made to the participant or a spouse, domestic partner, child, grandchild, parent, grandparent, brother, or sister of the participant or spouse or domestic partner of such child, grandchild, parent, grandparent, brother, or sister, or to a business entity in which the participant or any such person has a 10 percent or greater ownership interest;
	
	         (v)   payments in excess of the fair market value of services, materials, facilities, or other things of value received;
	
	         (vi)   (A)  any expenditure made after the participant has been finally disqualified or had his or her petitions finally declared invalid by the New York City Board of Elections or a court of competent jurisdiction, except that such expenditures may be made (1) as otherwise permitted pursuant to § 3-709(7) of the Code, or (2) for a different election (other than a special election to fill a vacancy) held later in the same calendar year in which the candidate seeks election for the same office;
	
	            (B)   any expenditure made after the only remaining opponent of the participant has been finally disqualified or had his or her petitions declared invalid by the New York City Board of Elections or a court of competent jurisdiction, except that such expenditures may be made for a different election (other than a special election to fill a vacancy) held later in the same calendar year in which the participant seeks election for the same office;
	
	            (C)   any other election, if the public funds were originally received for a special election to fill a vacancy.
	
	         (vii)   payments in cash;
	
	         (viii)   any contribution, transfer, or loan made to another candidate or political committee;
	
	         (ix)   gifts, except brochures, buttons, signs and other printed campaign material;
	
	         (x)   any expenditures to challenge or defend the validity of petitions of designation, or nomination, or certificates of nomination, acceptance, authorization, declination, or substitution, and expenses related to the canvassing of election results;
	
	         (xi)   any expenditure for which records required by 52 RCNY § 4-01 are not maintained or obtained by the participant;
	
	         (xii)   any expenditure that is not itemized in a disclosure statement submitted pursuant to 52 RCNY § 3-03;
	
	         (xiii)   any payment that is not made or reimbursed from an account disclosed by the participant pursuant to 52 RCNY § 1-11(a)(iv) or 2-01(a);
	
	         (xiv)   reimbursement for advances, except in the case of individual purchases in excess of $250;
	
	         (xv)   expenditures made in connection with any action, claim or suit before any court or arbitrator;
	
	         (xvi)   expenditures made primarily for the purpose of expressly advocating a vote for or against a ballot proposal, other than expenditures made also to further the participating candidate's nomination for election or election;
	
	         (xvii)   payment of any penalty or fine imposed pursuant to federal, state or local law; or
	
	         (xviii)   payments for services that were never received, including payments for legal services pursuant to a retainer agreement to the extent payments for such services exceed the value of the services rendered.
	
	      (3)   It is presumed that the following bills for goods and services are not qualified campaign expenditures:
	
	         (i)   bills for an election that are first reported in a disclosure statement submitted later than the 10 day or 27 day post-election disclosure statement applicable to that election; and
	
	         (ii)   bills first reported in an amendment to or resubmission of a disclosure statement that is made after the last election in an election year in which the participant is a candidate, or after a special election.
	
	      (4)   A liability that is not reported in a contemporaneous manner is a violation of § 3-703(6) of the Code and will not be considered a qualified campaign expenditure.
	
	   (h)   Joint expenditures; endorsements.
	
	      (1)   In accordance with the Act, nothing in these Rules shall be construed to restrict a candidate from authorizing expenditures for joint campaign materials and other joint campaign activities, including fundraising and campaign communications such as mailings and telephone and other communications, if the benefit the candidate derives from the material or activity is proportionally equivalent to the candidate's expenditures for the material or activity. To the extent a candidate derives a disproportionate benefit, the candidate is considered to have received a contribution and made an expenditure. Among the factors the Board will consider in determining whether the benefit is "proportionally equivalent," are:
	
	         (i)   the focus of the material or activity,
	
	         (ii)   the geographic distribution or location of the material or activity;
	
	         (iii)   the subject matter of the communication;
	
	         (iv)   the references to the candidate or the candidate's appearances therein;
	
	         (v)   the relative prominence of a candidate's references or appearances in the communication, including the size and location of references to the candidate and any photographs of the candidate;
	
	         (vi)   the timing of the communication; and
	
	         (vii)   other circumstances surrounding the communication. The amount spent by the candidate for these purposes is subject to the expenditure limit applicable under the Act, unless it is otherwise exempt.
	
	      (2)   Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (1) above, the following activities in support of another candidates by a participant, limited participant or non-participant shall not be considered contributions to or expenditures by such participant, limited participant or non-participant, except to the extent that such activities are paid for by the participant, limited participant or non-participant for a covered election:
	
	         (i)   the act alone of endorsing or appearing with another candidate for public office, party nomination or party position;
	
	         (ii)   the insubstantial communication of such endorsement or appearance described in subparagraph (i), such as where the candidate's name is one of several names appearing on the communication and is of equivalent prominence as the other names;
	
	         (iii)   fundraising assistance to another candidate in the form of written communications that do not promote the participant, limited participant or non-participant such as the appearance of the participant's, limited participant's or non-participant's, name or signature on a letter soliciting funds for another candidate or the appearance of the participant's, limited participant's or non-participant's name on fundraising material where the participant's, limited participant's or non-participant's name appears alone or with other names and is of equivalent prominence as the other names; and
	
	         (iv)   a typical communication by a political club to its members, which includes the name of a candidate, provided that the candidate is already a member of the political club, the political club has fewer than 500 members, and the communication does not solicit funds on behalf of or otherwise promote the participant's, limited participant's or non-participant's campaign for a covered election.
	
	      (3)   i)  The Board may, in its discretion, determine that the benefit to a candidate from references to or appearances of that candidate contained in another candidate's communication, such as campaign literature or an automated telephone call, is of de minimis value to the candidate based on the factors listed in paragraph (1) or other factors.
	
	         (ii)   Candidates and other individuals or entities may present information to the Board establishing such a de minimis benefit pursuant to 52 RCNY § 7-01, or in such other manner as the Board may determine, or the candidate may present such information during the post-election audit process.
	
	         (i)   Expenditures by check. No candidate may expend an amount in excess of $100 except by check drawn on a reported depository and signed by the candidate or person authorized to sign checks by the candidate.
	
	   (j)   [Reserved.]
	
	   (k)   Volunteer services. Candidates may not pay volunteers for services already performed on a voluntary basis for that election, but may hire them as paid employees or retain them as consultants for future services. Candidates may not accept professional services on a volunteer basis from individuals who previously provided, on a paid basis, services of a similar nature to the same campaign during the same election cycle. Candidates may not accept volunteer services from any entity, or from an individual having an ownership interest of ten percent or more in, or control over, any entity that provided paid services to the same campaign during the same election cycle. Notwithstanding the foregoing, after the election, candidates may accept volunteer services from individuals who previously provided paid services.
	
	   (l)   Expenditure limit compliance.
	
	      (1)   Participants and limited participants shall monitor whether their total expenditures exceed the limit of § 3-706(1) of the Code or, if applicable, the limit of § 3-706(3)(a)(i) of the Code. The amount of the expenditure limit that applies to the participant or limited participant in the calendar year of the election, pursuant to § 3-706(1) of the Code, shall be reduced by the amount by which the initial expenditure limit pursuant to § 3-706(2) of the Code is exceeded. Participants and limited participants have the burden of demonstrating that expenditures are exempt pursuant to § 3-706(4) of the Code. A participant or limited participant shall meet this burden by maintaining contemporaneous, detailed records that demonstrate that each individual expenditure claimed as exempt is exempt in accordance with § 3-706(4) of the Code and submitting such documentation as required under paragraph (3) below.
	
	      (2)   [Reserved.]
	
	      (3)   If a participant or limited participant fails to submit documentation sufficient to substantiate an exempt expenditure claim, the expenditure subject to such claim shall not be considered exempt from the expenditure limit applicable to the participant or limited participant under § 3-706(1) or § 3-706(3)(a)(i) of the Code.
	
	      (4)   For purposes of this subdivision, in determining whether a participant's or limited participant's total expenditures exceed the amount of the limit applicable under § 3-706(1) or § 3-706(3)(a)(i) of the Code, the following expenditures shall be excluded: (i) expenditures made in the first three years of the election cycle, to the extent such expenditures do not exceed the limit applicable under § 3-706(2) of the Code; and (ii) in the case of the general election expenditure limit, expenditures made not later than the closing date of the 10 day post-primary election disclosure statement, provided that the participant or limited participant was subject to a primary election expenditure limit.
	
	      (5)   Notwithstanding anything otherwise provided for in this subdivision, the reimbursement of an advance shall not be considered an exempt expenditure.
	
	   (m)   Fundraising for more than one election. When a candidate makes expenditures for a single event or other activity to raise funds for more than one office sought, and the first election that will be held is:
	
	      (1)   a covered election, the full amount of such expenditures is subject to the expenditure limits, the contribution limits, and the contribution prohibitions of the Act and the Charter.
	
	      (2)   not a covered election, a portion of such expenditures will be subject to the expenditure limits, the contribution limits, and the contribution prohibitions of the Act and the Charter in such proportion as the total funds raised in connection with such event or other fundraising activity for the second election bears to the total such funds raised for both elections by such event or activity. Alternatively, the candidate may demonstrate to the Board that a different apportionment is applicable in accordance with 52 RCNY § 1-07(d).
	
	   (n)   Fundraising solicitations. Each written solicitation of contributions by or on behalf of a candidate, whether in paper or electronic format, shall include the following statement, written in a conspicuous and clearly recognizable manner: "State law prohibits making a contribution in someone else's name, reimbursing someone for a contribution made in your name, being reimbursed for a contribution made in your name, or claiming to have made a contribution when a loan is made."
	
	   (o)   Expenditure limit compliance for transfers. In the case of a transfer of funds from a committee not otherwise involved in the covered election, other than another principal committee of the same candidate, the participant must allocate to the transferred contributions any expenditures incurred by the transferor committee during the covered election cycle in connection with raising or administering transferred contributions, and any expenditures incurred by the transferor committee prior to the covered election cycle in connection with raising the transferred contributions. In such a case, the participant has the burden of demonstrating, for the purpose of compliance with the expenditure limits of the Act, what expenditures incurred by the transferor committee were not made in connection with raising or administering the transferred contributions. At the Board's request, the participant shall provide documentation related to any such expenditures, including copies of Federal forms or disclosure statements filed with the New York State or City Board of Elections on behalf of the transferor committee. Expenditures will be applied towards the expenditure limit in effect at the time of the transfer; provided, however, that in the case of transfers made prior to the covered election cycle, expenditures will be applied towards the expenditure limits of § 3-706(2).
	
	   (p)   Expenditures not in furtherance of the campaign. In determining whether or not an expenditure is in furtherance of a candidate’s nomination or election, the Board may consider any of the factors from the following non-exhaustive list:
	
	      (1)   the timing of the expenditure;
	
	      (2)   whether the campaign has already purchased duplicative services or equipment;
	
	      (3)   the nature of the goods or services purchased;
	
	      (4)   whether an unusually high proportion of funds was spent on a specific category of expenditure;
	
	      (5)   whether a high total dollar amount or proportion of payments was made to individuals rather than to entities;
	
	      (6)   whether the campaign has demonstrated a pattern of making other expenditures not in furtherance of the campaign or impermissible post-election expenditures; and
	
	      (7)   whether an expenditure made less than one month prior to the election, or after the election, is accompanied by the reporting of a corresponding outstanding liability.
	
	




§ 1-09 Documents Submitted to and Issued by the Board. ::


	   (a)    Date received.
	
	      (1)   Generally. Documents submitted to the Board, whether in an electronic manner or otherwise, will be deemed to have been submitted upon receipt by the Board. The Board receives hand-delivered documents at its offices, weekdays between 9 a.m. and 5 p.m., unless otherwise provided by the Board.
	
	      (2)   Postmark date. Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (3) for disclosure statements, a document submitted by non-electronic mail will be deemed to have been received by the Board on the date the document is postmarked. Documents delivered by non-electronic common carriers other than the United States Post Office will be deemed to have been received by the Board on the date the common carrier received the document. Candidates have the burden of demonstrating the date the common carrier received such document, including by means of the common carrier's time stamp or payment receipt.
	
	      (3)   Disclosure statements.
	
	         (i)   Candidates who submit disclosure statements through non-electronic mail with the United States Post Office or by other non-electronic common carrier shall obtain a receipt or date stamp confirming the date on which the carrier received the disclosure statement. Such disclosure statements that are delivered by the Post Office or common carrier to the Board without a postmark or similar mark will be presumed to have been mailed three days earlier unless evidence presented to the Board, such as a post office receipt, establishes otherwise.
	
	         (ii)   A complete disclosure statement, submitted in an electronic manner or otherwise, actually received by the Board no later than close of business on the due date for that disclosure statement applicable under 52 RCNY § 3-02 will be considered to be submitted in a timely manner and to permit the Board to make a payment determination based on matchable contributions claimed therein when the Board next makes payment determinations. In order to make possible payment within four business days after receipt of disclosure statements, or as soon thereafter as is practicable, pursuant to § 3-705(4) of the Code, the Board may not review disclosure statements for possible payment if they are not actually received by the Board by the specified due date, although the Board may review such disclosure statements when making payment determinations at a later date.
	
	         (iii)   A complete disclosure statement, not actually received by the Board by the due date applicable under 52 RCNY § 3-02, that is delivered by non-electronic mail with a postmark date that is on or before the due date, or received by another non-electronic common carrier on or before the due date, nonetheless will be considered to be submitted in a timely manner. This submission, however, may not be sufficiently timely to permit the Board to make a payment determination when the Board next makes payment determinations so the Board shall make a determination on such a disclosure statement at such time as it is practicable and the Board is considering making payments based on matchable contributions claimed in disclosure statements actually received on or before a subsequent applicable due date.
	
	         (iv)   A candidate who fails to deliver a complete disclosure statement in a timely manner is in violation of the Act and subject to penalty under §§ 3-710.5 and 3-711(1) of the Code.
	
	      (4)   Documents submitted electronically. Candidates and others submitting documents to the Board electronically shall submit such documents in such electronic manner as shall be provided by the Board.
	
	   (b)   Legibility; Readability. The Board will not accept any electronic disclosure statement or other document, or any part thereof, that is infected with a virus, damaged, blank, improperly formatted, or otherwise unreadable by the Board, or if the disclosure statement or other document, or any part thereof, is in a non-electronic format, is illegible.
	
	   (c)   Documentation. Disclosure statements will not be deemed complete unless submitted with the records required by Rules 3-04(a) and 4-01(b)(2) and (3) for each matchable contribution claimed in the disclosure statement.
	
	   (d)   Date issued or provided. Documents sent by mail, including any report or notice, shall be considered issued or provided by the Board on the date the document is postmarked. Documents sent by a common carrier shall be considered issued or provided by the Board on the date that the documents were received by the common carrier. Documents sent by electronic mail to an e-mail address provided to the Board shall be considered issued or provided upon transmission, unless the Board is informed that the transmission did not reach the intended recipient.
	
	




§ 1-10 Severability. ::


	If any rule or portion thereof is adjudged invalid by a court of competent jurisdiction, such determination shall not affect or impair the validity of the other provisions of these Rules. If the application of any rule or portion thereof to any person or circumstances is adjudged invalid by a court of competent jurisdiction, such determination shall not affect or impair the application thereof to other persons and circumstances.




§ 1-11 Filer Registration. ::


	   (a)   Not later than the day that a candidate files the first disclosure statement for an election, the candidate shall submit a filer registration form. The filer registration form shall include:
	
	      (1)   the candidate's name, address information and telephone numbers, e-mail address, and employment information;
	
	      (2)   the name and mailing address, and treasurer name, treasurer address information and telephone numbers, treasurer e-mail address, and treasurer employment information, of every political committee authorized by the candidate that has not been terminated, and, in the case of a participant or limited participant, an indication of which such committee is the principal committee;
	
	      (3)   the name, mailing address, e-mail address, and telephone number of any person designated by the candidate to act as liaison with the Board for each committee filing disclosure statements;
	
	      (4)   identification of all bank accounts and other depository accounts, including merchant and payment processor accounts, into which receipts have been, or will be, deposited, and all bank accounts used for the purpose of repaying debt from a previous election; and
	
	      (5)   other information as required by the Board.
	
	   (b)   The candidate shall notify the Board of any material change, including any new information, or any change to any required information, concerning any political committee, bank account, merchant or payment processor account, candidate or treasurer employment, address, telephone number, or e-mail address, in the filer registration form in such manner as may be provided by the Board. The candidate shall notify the Board of any such changes no later than the next deadline for filing a disclosure statement, or, in the case of changes that occur after the deadline for the last disclosure statement required to be filed, no later than 30 days after the date of the change; provided, however, that if the candidate has extinguished all outstanding liabilities resulting from the election to which the filer registration relates, including payment of any penalties and/or repayment of public funds owed to the Board, the candidate need not notify the Board of any material change to the filer registration information after the date the candidate's final audit report is issued, except as provided in Rule 4-03(b).
	
	   (c)   Small campaign registration. If neither the expected total cumulative receipts nor the expected total cumulative expenditures of a candidate, including expenditures made with the candidate's personal funds, exceeds an amount equal to the amount applicable to qualify for the exception provided in section 14-124(4) of the State Election Law, the candidate may, instead of submitting a filer registration form, submit a small campaign registration form, which must contain such information as may be required by the Board. The small campaign registration form must also include an affirmation stating that neither the total cumulative receipts nor the total cumulative expenditures of the candidate, including expenditures made with the candidate's personal funds, will exceed the amount applicable to qualify for the exception provided in section 14-124(4) of the State Election Law, and that if such amount is exceeded, the candidate will submit a filer registration form and all subsequent required disclosure statements, beginning on or before the deadline to file the next disclosure statement.
	
	   (d)   Applicable requirements. Because the requirements of the Act and these Rules apply to financial transactions that take place before a participant or limited participant joins the Program, the Board advises candidates to comply with all applicable requirements set forth in the Act and these Rules, in anticipation of joining the Program.
	
	   (e)   Construction. The submission of a filer registration form, or an amendment thereto, shall not be construed as a statement of intent to become a candidate, to run for any particular office, or to join the Program.
	
	




Chapter 2: Candidate Requirements
--------------------------------------------------
§ 2-01 Certification. ::


	   (a)    Contents. The candidate shall specify in the certification whether he or she is joining the Program as a participant pursuant to § 3-703 of the Code or as a limited participant pursuant to § 3-718 of the Code. The certification shall include all filer registration information required by Rule 1-11 and such other information as required by the Board, including all information necessary to receive payment by electronic funds transfer. In the certification, the participant or limited participant shall designate a principal committee. A candidate filing the certification as a limited participant shall affirm that he or she has a sufficient amount of personal funds to fund his or her own campaign. A candidate's personal funds or property shall include his or her funds or property jointly held with his or her spouse, domestic partner, or unemancipated children.
	
	   (b)   Legal effect. The participant shall comply fully with Program requirements in all elections for which the certification is submitted, regardless of the office sought and regardless whether the participant: (1) meets all the requirements of law to have his or her name on the ballot in the election; or (2) meets the Act's threshold for eligibility for public funds; or (3) accepts public funds; or (4) is otherwise not eligible to receive public funds in the election. The limited participant shall comply fully with the Program requirements in all elections for which the certification is submitted, regardless of the office sought and regardless whether the limited participant meets all the requirements of law to have his or her name on the ballot in the election. A candidate who does not file a timely certification or who rescinds his or her certification in a timely manner shall be deemed to be a non-participant pursuant to § 3-719 of the Code. The certification applies to all elections for an office covered by the Act that are held in the same calendar year or to a special election to fill a vacancy in an office covered by the Act.
	
	   (c)   Signatures. The certification shall contain any signatures and notarizations as may be required by the Board; provided, however, that to the extent the Board permits a candidate to submit a certification in a non-electronic format, such certification will only be accepted by the Board if it contains an original notarized signature from both the candidate and the principal committee treasurer.
	
	   (d)   Amendments. The participant or limited participant shall notify the Board of any material change in the information submitted pursuant to this rule, including, but not limited to any new, or any change to any required information concerning any political committee, bank account, unique merchant account, candidate or treasurer employment, address, telephone number, or e-mail address, included in the filer registration information required by 52 RCNY § 1-11, in such manner as may be provided by the Board and no later than the next deadline for filing a disclosure statement or, in the case of changes that occur after the deadline for the last disclosure statement required to be filed, no later than 30 days after the date of the change, provided, however, that if the participant or limited participant has extinguished all outstanding liabilities resulting from the election to which the certification relates, including payment of any penalties and/or repayment of public funds owed to the Board, the candidate need not notify the Board of any material change to the information required by 52 RCNY § 1-11 after issuance of the candidate's final audit report, except as provided in 52 RCNY § 4-03(b). If, based upon a reasonable belief that there has been a material change in the information submitted, the Board requests an amendment, the participant or limited participant shall submit promptly any amendment necessary in such manner as may be provided by the Board. Notification of any change to the candidate's or treasurer's information included in the certification must be made to the Board for six (6) years after the date of the last election to which the certification relates.
	
	   (e)   Petition for extraordinary circumstances.
	
	      (1)   Pursuant to § 3-703(1)(c) of the Code, a certification may be accepted no later than the seventh day after the occurrence of an extraordinary circumstance in an election, if: (i) prior to, or together with, the certification, a written petition is submitted to the Board, sworn to or affirmed by a candidate in such election seeking to join the Program as a participant or limited participant, which sets forth the facts alleged to present an extraordinary circumstance; and (ii) following review of the petition, the Board declares that an extraordinary circumstance has occurred in the election which permits or permitted the acceptance of additional certifications, as provided in § 3-703(1)(c). The Board shall provide written notice to each participant and limited participant in an election of its declaration of an extraordinary circumstance in the election, which shall include the names of any additional candidates who have filed certifications in a timely manner in light of the extraordinary circumstance.
	
	      (2)   Nothing in this rule shall be construed to: (i) require the Board to make a declaration of an extraordinary circumstance within seven days of its occurrence; or (ii) extend the deadline for joining the Program, in the event the Board does not declare that an extraordinary circumstance has occurred until more than seven days after its occurrence; or (iii) prohibit the acceptance of a certification filed by a candidate in an election within seven days after the occurrence of an extraordinary circumstance in that election, if the candidate did not file a petition under subparagraph (1)(i), provided that another candidate in such election has filed such a petition and the Board makes the declaration under subparagraph (1)(ii).
	
	      (3)   An "extraordinary circumstance" includes: (i) the death of a candidate in an election, (ii) the resignation or removal of the person holding the office sought, and (iii) the submission to the Board of a written declaration, sworn to or affirmed by the holder of the office sought, terminating his or her campaign for reelection (which may be submitted together with a petition under subparagraph (1)(i)).
	
	   (f)   Rescission. A participant or limited participant may rescind his or her certification on or before the ninth Monday preceding the primary election or prior to the receipt of public funds, whichever occurs first, by filing a certification rescission form.
	
	




§ 2-02 Breach of Certification. ::


	The Board considers each of the following activities to be a fundamental breach of the obligations affirmed and accepted by the participant or limited participant in the certification:
	
	   (a)   submission of a disclosure statement which the participant knew or should have known includes substantial fraudulent matchable contribution claims;
	
	   (b)   use of public funds to make or reimburse substantial campaign expenditures which the participant knew or should have known were fraudulent;
	
	   (c)   cooperation in alleged independent expenditures, whereby material or activity that directly or indirectly assists or benefits a participant's or limited participant's nomination or election, which is purported to be paid by independent expenditures, was in fact authorized, requested, suggested, fostered, or cooperated in by the participant or limited participant;
	
	   (d)   use of a political committee or other entity over which a participant or limited participant exercises authority to conceal from the Board expenditures that directly or indirectly assist or benefit the participant's or limited participant's nomination or election; and
	
	   (e)   submission of substantial information which the participant or limited participant knew or should have known was false, or the submission of substantial documentation which the participant or limited participant knew or should have known was fabricated or falsified, which would avoid a finding of violation or public funds repayment determination. In the event of a fundamental breach, the participant will be deemed by the Board to be ineligible for public funds and to have forfeited all public funds previously received for the elections covered by the certifications and the participant or limited participant will be subject to such civil and criminal sanctions as are applicable under § 3-711 of the Code and other applicable law. This rule is not intended to be an enumeration of all circumstances that may constitute a fundamental breach of obligations, as may be determined by the Board.




§ 2-03 Campaign Information. [Repealed] ::


	   (a)    Deposit of receipts. All contributions, loans, and other receipts shall be deposited into the account(s) listed on the candidate's filer registration and/or certification and in disclosure statements filed with the Board. Candidates opening accounts shall maintain at least one account with check writing privileges.
	
	   (b)   Separate accounts for different elections. Receipts accepted for one election shall not be commingled in any account with receipts accepted for any other election, except that receipts for a primary and general election for the same office in the same calendar year may be deposited in the same account. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a candidate seeking election both to an office subject to the Act and to a federal office may maintain a separate allocation account for shared expenses in accordance with Advisory Opinion No. 1996-2 .
	
	   (c)   Runoff primary and runoff special elections. A candidate may accept contributions for an anticipated runoff primary or anticipated runoff special election pursuant to 52 RCNY § 1-04(q).
	
	      (1)   i)  If a candidate accepts receipts for a runoff election, they shall be deposited into an account from which no disbursements, withdrawals, or transfers are made prior to the day of the preceding primary or special election, as the case may be, except that such contributions may be returned to contributors until the candidate first receives public funds for the runoff election.
	
	         (ii)   Receipts accepted for a runoff primary shall not be (i) commingled in any account with any receipts accepted for any other election; or (ii) used for a primary or general election held in the year that the runoff primary is held or anticipated.
	
	         (iii)   Receipts accepted for a runoff special election shall not be commingled in any account with any receipts accepted for any other election or used for any other election until the runoff special election is actually held; provided, however, that funds may be transferred from a special election account to a runoff special election account after the special election so that the funds transferred may be spent in the runoff special election. Receipts accepted for an anticipated runoff special election that is not held may not be spent or otherwise transferred until the earlier of (A) the first January 12 after the date of the special election for which the runoff special election was anticipated or (B) the date upon which all the candidate's liabilities from the special election have been ex- tinguished.
	
	      (2)   Notwithstanding any provision of subdivision (b) or paragraph (c)(1) to the contrary, funds may be exchanged between an account maintained for a primary and/or the general election and an account maintained for a runoff primary for the following reasons only:
	
	         (i)   transfers from a primary and/or general election account to a runoff primary account made after the primary election so that the funds transferred may be spent in the runoff primary; and
	
	         (ii)   transfers from a runoff primary account to a primary and/or general election account made after the runoff primary is held so that the funds transferred may be spent in the general election.
	
	   (d)   Special elections. Receipts accepted for a special election shall not be commingled in any account with any receipts accepted for any other election, except that receipts accepted for a special election may be deposited into an account established for a runoff special election pursuant to 52 RCNY § 1-04(q) in accordance with paragraph (c) above.
	
	   (e)   Personal and business funds. The personal or business funds of a candidate, his or her agent, or any other person or entity may not be commingled with campaign funds. This rule does not restrict the deposit of contributions or loans into an account maintained by an authorized committee.
	
	   (f)   Court-ordered rerun elections. Public funds received for a court-ordered rerun election shall not be commingled in any account with any other funds.
	
	   (g)   Segregated Bank Accounts for 52 RCNY § 5-01(n) Disbursements. Contributions received pursuant to 52 RCNY § 5-01(n)(2) shall be deposited into a segregated bank account established pursuant to such Rule.




§ 2-07 Participant's Disqualification from Ballot. ::


	   (a)    Public fund eligibility. To be eligible for public funds, a participant must qualify to be on the ballot, and be opposed on the ballot, or, for the optional early public funds payment, certify that he or she intends to meet all the requirements of law to have his or her name on the ballot for the primary or general election.
	
	   (b)   Notice of disqualification. If a participant or the participant's only remaining opponent in an election is disqualified from the ballot by the New York City Board of Elections or a court of competent jurisdiction, the participant shall immediately inform the Board, by a hand-delivered memorandum, facsimile transmission, telegram, or other method of equivalent speed. If the disqualification by a court of competent jurisdiction was on the grounds that fraudulent acts were committed in order to obtain a place on the ballot, the notice shall so state.
	
	   (c)   Remedies for disqualification. The participant shall notify the Board immediately, in writing, if the disqualified candidate is seeking to appeal or otherwise remedy a disqualification. This notice shall indicate whether a judicial appeal is being taken as of right or by permission and the specific nature of any other judicial remedy sought.
	
	   (d)   Disqualification reversed. The participant shall immediately inform the Board, in writing, if the disqualification of the participant or the opponent is reversed by a court of competent jurisdiction.
	
	




§ 2-08 Write-in Candidates. ::


	   (a)    Notice. Any candidate who is seeking nomination or election to a covered office as a write-in candidate must promptly so notify the Board in writing.
	
	   (b)   Disclosure obligations. Any candidate who is seeking nomination or election as a write-in candidate must file all disclosure statements for the election as required by 52 RCNY § 3-02.
	
	   (c)   Ineligibility for public funds. A participant who is seeking nomination or election exclusively as a write-in candidate and who is not on the ballot for the election is ineligible to receive public funds. A participant who is on the ballot for a covered election and who is opposed in such election solely by one or more candidates seeking nomination or election exclusively as write-in candidates and who are not on the ballot is ineligible to receive public funds.
	
	   (d)   Inclusion in Voter Guide. A candidate who is seeking nomination or election exclusively as a write-in candidate and who is not on the ballot for the election shall not be included in the voter guide for that election.




§ 2-09 Terminating a Candidacy. ::


	   (a)    No "Opting-Out". A candidate may discontinue filing disclosure statements after filing a verified statement that his or her candidacy is terminated in accordance with subsections (b) or (c) of this rule, or if the Board has deemed the candidacy terminated pursuant to subsection (d) of this rule. Terminating a candidacy does not relieve the candidate of other Program obligations, such as maintaining records required by these Rules, submitting documentation or information in response to requests by the Board, and paying penalties for violations of the requirements of the Act and these Rules.
	
	   (b)   "Off the ballot" termination.
	
	      (1)   A participant may submit to the Board a verification that he or she is not a candidate for that election if the participant: (i) is not on the ballot for that election; (ii) is not seeking nomination or election as a write-in candidate; (iii) has not received public funds; and (iv) has not submitted and does not intend to submit a petition for payment after final disqualification from the ballot, pursuant to 52 RCNY § 5-02(b). The verification shall be in such form and manner as shall be provided by the Board, and shall contain such signatures as may be required by the Board.
	
	      (2)   A limited participant or non-participant may submit to the Board a verification that he or she is not a candidate for that election if the candidate: (i) is not on the ballot for that election; and (ii) is not seeking nomination or election as a write-in candidate. The verification shall be in such form and manner as shall be provided by the Board, and shall contain such signatures as may be required by the Board.
	
	   (c)   "Ceased campaigning" termination. A particiant may submit to the Board a verification that he or she is not a candidate for that election if the participant: (1) has ceased all campaign activity for that election; (2) has not received public funds; and (3) has not submitted and does not intend to submit a petition for payment after final disqualification from the ballot, pursuant to 52 RCNY § 5-02(b). A limited participant or non-participant may submit to the Board a verification that he or she is not a candidate for that election if the candidate has ceased all campaign activity for that election. The verification shall be in such form and manner as shall be provided by the Board, and shall contain such signatures as may be required by the Board.
	
	   (d)   Termination by Board. The Board may send a notice to a participant that his or her candidacy has been deemed terminated if the participant: (1) is not on the ballot for that election; (2) has not received public funds; and (3) has not submitted a petition for payment after final disqualification from the ballot, pursuant to 52 RCNY § 5-02(b). The Board may send a notice to a limited participant or non-participant that his or her candidacy has been deemed terminated if the candidate is not on the ballot for that election. If the candidate is continuing to seek nomination or election as a write-in candidate, or, in the case of a participant, intends to submit a petition for public funds pursuant to 52 RCNY § 5-022(b), the candidate must so notify the Board within 10 days after receiving the notice of termination, in which case the Board will reverse the termination and the candidate must continue to submit disclosure statements. In any event, the termination will be reversed and disclosure obligations resumed if the candidate remains a candidate in the election.




§ 2-10 Limited Participation. ::

Chapter 3: Campaign Finance Disclosure Statements
--------------------------------------------------
§ 3-01 Explanation. ::


	Disclosure statements serve several different purposes:
	
	   (a)   they provide comprehensive disclosure of candidates' campaign finances for prompt examination by the voting public and permit integration into the Board's computerized Campaign Finance Information System for purposes of additional disclosure, monitoring of campaign finances, and analysis mandated by the Act;
	
	   (b)   they enable the Board to monitor candidate compliance with Program requirements; and
	
	   (c)   they enable participants to make claims for public funds.




§ 3-02 Filing Dates. ::


	   (a)    First disclosure statement.
	
	      (1)   A candidate's first disclosure statement shall be the first disclosure statement during the applicable election cycle covering the date on which the candidate first raises or spends funds in furtherance of his or her campaign for election for an office covered by the Act unless otherwise provided by New York Election Law.
	
	      (2)   In a special election held to fill a vacancy, a candidate's first disclosure statement is due 32 days before the election unless otherwise provided by New York Election Law. As provided pursuant to New York Election Law, if the first disclosure statement for a special election is otherwise due within a period of five days of a required semi-annual disclosure statement, the candidate may file a single combined statement on the date on which the latter of the two separate statements is required to be filed.
	
	   (b)   Semi-annual disclosure statements.
	
	      (1)   Semi-annual disclosure statements are due on January 15 and July 15 in each year of the election cycle and on January 15 in the year after the election.
	
	      (2)   Notwithstanding paragraph (1) above, (i) for candidates in a special election who continue to raise or spend funds for the following primary or general election, the 27 day post-election disclosure statement described in subdivision (d) shall be the last statement required for the special election; provided, however, that in the event that there is a runoff special election, the semi-annual disclosure statement described in subdivision (d) shall be the last disclosure statement required for all candidates in the special election who continue to raise or spend funds for the following primary or general election, regardless whether they were candidates in the runoff special election; and (ii) for candidates in a special election who do not continue to raise or spend funds for the following primary or general election, the first semi-annual disclosure statement due following the date of the special election shall be the last statement required for the special election, provided, however, that if the first semi-annual disclosure statement following the date of the special election is due less than 30 days after the deadline for filing the 27 day post-election disclosure statement, then the second semi-annual disclosure statement after the date of the special election shall be the last statement required for the special election.
	
	      (3)   Following submission of the last disclosure statement for an election, the candidate remains, in any case, with respect to the previous election, subject to all other Program requirements and shall submit such information and proof of compliance as may be requested by the Board, including copies of State forms, bank records, and records demonstrating payment of outstanding liabilities.
	
	   (c)   Pre-election disclosure statements. Pre-election disclosure statements are due 32 and 11 days before the election and, at the Board's discretion, on or by March 15 and May 15 in the year of the election. In a runoff election, the only pre-election statement is due 4 days before the election.
	
	   (d)   Post-election disclosure statements. Post-election disclosure statements are due 27 days after the election, except in the case of a primary or runoff primary election, the disclosure statement is due 10 days after the election, and in the case of a runoff special election, disclosure statements are due both 27 days after the election and on the first January 15 or July 15 following the date of the runoff special election. Candidates in the special election must file both post-runoff special election disclosure statements regardless whether they were on the ballot in the runoff special election.
	
	   (e)   Daily disclosures during two weeks preceding the election. If a candidate, during the 14 days preceding an election, accepts aggregate contributions and/or loans from a single source in excess of $1,000 or makes aggregate expenditures to a single vendor in excess of $20,000, the candidate shall report, in a disclosure to the Board, all contributions and loans accepted from such source or expenditures made to such vendor during that 14-day period. The first such disclosure must be received by the Board within 24 hours after the contribution or loan that causes the total to exceed $1,000 is accepted or the expenditure that causes the total to exceed $20,000 is made. Each subsequent disclosure must be received by the Board within 24 hours after the contribution or loan is accepted or expenditure is made. Information reported in these disclosures must also be included in the candidate's next post-election disclosure statement.
	
	   (f)   Exceptions.
	
	      (1)   Not in primary election. A candidate need not submit the two pre-primary and the 10 day post-primary election disclosure statements if the candidate is not a candidate in a primary election unless the candidate is a participant or limited participant claiming that expenditures are subject to a primary election spending limit, pursuant to 52 RCNY § 1-08(c)(2)(ii) or (iii). If the candidate is not a candidate in the primary, daily disclosures during the two weeks preceding the primary need not be submitted.
	
	      (2)   Not in general election. A candidate need not submit the two pre-general election and 27 day post-general election disclosure statements or daily disclosures during the two weeks preceding the general election, if the candidate is not a candidate in the general election.
	
	      (3)   Deferred filing. A candidate need not submit a full disclosure statement, if the candidate has accepted less than $2,000 in contributions and loans since the candidate last submitted a disclosure statement and has not made expenditures exceeding forty-five percent of the applicable expenditure limit. This paragraph does not apply to semi-annual disclosure statements. On each disclosure statement filing date for which an exception is not provided pursuant to paragraph (1) or (2), the treasurer shall verify, in a manner provided by the Board, that a full disclosure statement is not required to be submitted pursuant to this paragraph.
	
	      (4)   Small campaigns. A candidate who has filed a small campaign registration form pursuant to Rule 1-11(c) need not submit disclosure statements if neither the total cumulative receipts nor the total cumulative expenditures of the candidate exceeds an amount equal to the amount necessary to qualify for the exception provided in section 14-124(4) of the State Election Law. If a candidate who has filed a small campaign registration form raises or spends an amount exceeding the amount necessary to qualify for the exception provided in section 14-124(4) of the State Election Law, the candidate must submit all subsequent required disclosure statements, beginning on or before the deadline to file the next disclosure statement. The first such statement filed must include all prior financial activity beginning at the inception of the campaign.
	
	      (5)   Other political committees. Political committees that are not involved in a covered election shall not file disclosure statements, or State or Federal forms, except as requested by the Board. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the financial records of any committees of a candidate are subject to Board review for purposes of monitoring the candidate's compliance with the requirements of the Act and these Rules and shall be made available to the Board upon its request.
	
	      (6)   Next disclosure statement. Information which would otherwise be included in a disclosure statement for which an exception is provided pursuant to paragraph (1), (2), (3), or (4) shall be included in the next disclosure statement required to be submitted to the Board.
	
	      (7)   Board requests. Notwithstanding any deferral or exception provided by this subdivision, candidates must submit such disclosure statements or other documents as may be requested by the Board.
	
	      (8)   Terminated candidacy. A candidate need not submit any disclosure statements if his or her candidacy has been terminated, as described in 52 RCNY § 2-09(b), (c), and (d), and the termination is not reversed pursuant to 52 RCNY § 2-09(d).
	
	      (9)   Terminated committee. If a committee terminates activities (by complete payment of all liabilities and expenditure of all funds in its possession) before the last disclosure statement for an election is due, the committee shall file its last disclosure statement for the election upon its termination, together with a cover letter stating that it has terminated its activities.
	
	   (g)   [Reserved.]
	
	   (h)   Weekends and holidays. If a disclosure statement is due to be submitted on a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday, the submission of the disclosure statement by 5 p.m. on the next business day shall be considered timely.

A matchable contribution claim will be invalidated unless the records that are required to be maintained pursuant to Rules 4-01(b)(2) and (3) are submitted with the disclosure statement in which the contribution is reported. Matchable contribution claims determined by the Board to be invalid pursuant to the Act and these Rules shall not be counted toward a participant's threshold for eligibility for public financing.

Chapter 4: Accounting and Auditing
--------------------------------------------------
§ 4-01 Records to be kept. ::


	   (a)    Generally. Candidates must keep records that enable the Board to verify the accuracy of disclosure statements, substantiate that expenditures were made in furtherance of the campaign, were qualified expenditures, or were permissible post-election expenditures, and confirm any matchable contributions claimed. Candidates must maintain and may be required to produce originals and copies of checks, bills, or other documentation to verify contributions, expenditures, or other transactions reported in their disclosure statements. Candidates shall maintain clear and accurate records sufficient to show an audit trail that demonstrates compliance with the Act and these Rules. The records shall be made and maintained contemporaneously with the transactions recorded, and maintained and organized in a manner that facilitates expeditious review by the Board. Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to modify the requirements of New York Election Law § 14-118. The records maintained for each campaign finance transaction, whether maintained on paper and/or electronically, shall be accurate and, if necessary, modified promptly to ensure continuing accuracy. Records that are contemporaneous and complete, as described in this Rule, including records using forms supplied by the Board, shall be presumed to be sufficient to demonstrate financial activity. If at any time a candidate becomes aware that a record of an expenditure, whether maintained on paper or electronically or both, is missing or incomplete, the candidate may create a new record or modify an existing record, provided that the record so created or modified is clearly identified by the candidate as such, and provided, further, that if the missing or incomplete record is an invoice from a vendor, the candidate must in the first instance attempt to get a duplicate or more complete record directly from such vendor prior to creating a new record or modifying an existing record. In addition, the candidate must create a further record, in the form of a signed, dated, and notarized statement by the candidate and/or treasurer and/or other campaign representative having first-hand knowledge of the matter, explaining the reasons for and the circumstances surrounding the creation or modification of a record. The Board reserves the right not to accept a noncontemporaneous record created or modified pursuant to this paragraph if, after review of the timing and other circumstances, it determines that the record is not sufficient to document the actual transaction.
	
	   (b)   Receipts.
	
	      (1)   Deposit slips. Candidates shall maintain copies of all deposit slips. The deposit slips shall be grouped together with the monetary instruments representing the receipts deposited into the bank or other depository accounts held by the candidate for an election, unless the candidate maintains other records that show, in a manner that similarly facilitates expeditious review, when these receipts were deposited. Where the bank or depository does not provide itemized deposit slips, candidates shall make a contemporaneous written record of each deposit. Such written record shall indicate the date of the deposit, the source and amount of each item deposited, whether each item deposited was a check, a money order, or cash, the name and title of the individual who made the deposit, and the total amount deposited.
	
	      (2)   Photocopies of checks and other monetary instruments.

	         (ii)   Participants seeking additional public funds, pursuant to § 3-705(7)(b) of the Code must file a signed statement with the Board, pursuant to § 3-705(7)(b) no later than the due date for the disclosure statement immediately preceding the public funds payment for which the participant is seeking to receive the additional public funds; provided, however, that participants seeking to receive the additional public funds on the first date payments are made by the Board after the optional early public funds payment, must file the signed statement with the Board no later than the day before the first date the Board of Elections conducts hearings on any ballot petition filed by any candidate seeking nomination for election in any primary occurring in the same election cycle for which the candidate is seeking nomination for election, without regard to whether such hearings are related to a petition filed by an opponent of the participant.
	
	      (3)   Small primaries.
	
	         (i)   A participant on the ballot in one or more primary election(s) in which the number of persons eligible to vote for party nominees in each such election totals fewer than one thousand shall not receive public funds in excess of five thousand dollars for qualified campaign expenditures in such election or elections; provided, however, that the foregoing limitation shall not apply to such participant if he or she is opposed in a primary election by (A) a participant who is not subject to such limitation or (B) a limited participant or non-participant who has spent or contracted or obligated to spend in excess of ten thousand dollars for such primary election. The Board shall determine whether a non-participant has exceeded such ten thousand dollar level pursuant to 52 RCNY § 7-03.
	
	         (ii)   For the purposes of subparagraph (i), the number of persons eligible to vote for party nominees in a primary election shall be as determined by the Board of Elections for the calendar year of the primary election pursuant to § 5-604 of the New York Election Law. If such determination for any primary election is not available from the Board of Elections as of the day before the due date for filing a certification pursuant to § 3-703(1)(c) of the Code, the most recent determination by the Board of Elections of the persons eligible to vote for party nominees for the office for which such primary election is held shall be relied upon.
	
	      (4)   Non-competitive campaigns.
	
	         (i)   Pursuant to § 3-705(9) of the Code, a participating candidate who endorses or otherwise publicly supports his or her opponent for election shall not be eligible for public funds.
	
	         (ii)   Pursuant to § 3-705(10) of the Code, a participating candidate who loses the primary election but remains on the ballot for the general election shall be ineligible to receive public funds unless the candidate certifies to the Board that he or she will actively campaign for office, by measures including but not limited to raising and spending funds, seeking endorsements, and broadly soliciting votes.
	
	      (5)   [Repealed.]
	
	   (b)   Preliminary review of disclosure statements.
	
	         (i)   In order to make possible payment within four business days after receipt of disclosure statements, or as soon thereafter as is practicable, pursuant to § 3-705(4) of the Code, the Board shall conduct a preliminary review of all disclosure statements filed. This preliminary review may be delayed if the participant fails to submit a disclosure statement or information requested by the Board by the date required by the Board, or submits a disclosure statement that fails to comply substantially with the requirements of the Act or these rules. A preliminary review may also be delayed for other reasons, including, but not limited to, consideration of whether a basis exists for an ineligibility determination, as described in subdivision (f). A delayed preliminary review may result in a delay in a payment determination, until such time as it is practicable and the Board is considering making payments based on matchable contributions claimed in disclosure statements actually received on or before a subsequent applicable due date.
	
	         (ii)   After a participant has been informed that a matchable contribution claim has been deemed invalid or that the participant is ineligible for public funds, the participant shall not include in any petition or request to the Board any documentation or factual information not submitted to the Board prior to the determination under review unless the participating candidate can demonstrate good cause for the previous failure to submit such documentation or information and for any failures to communicate on a timely basis with the Board.
	
	   (c)   Basis for payments. The amount paid to a participant shall be based upon the Board's review and audit of matchable contributions claimed and qualified campaign expenditures.
	
	   (d)   Validity of matchable contribution claims and projected rate of invalid claims. The Board shall not make payment for any matchable contribution claim it determines or projects to be invalid. The Board shall consider the following factors in determining that matchable contribution claims are invalid and in projecting a rate of invalid matchable contribution claims:
	
	      (1)   cash contributions from any one contributor that are greater than $100 in the aggregate, in violation of New York Election Law § 14-118(2), or money order contributions from any one contributor that are greater than $100 in the aggregate;
	
	      (2)   contributors who are individuals under the age of eighteen years or that are entities other than individuals;
	
	      (3)   matchable contribution claims that would yield more than $1,050 in public funds per contributor;
	
	      (4)   contributions that exceed the contribution limit applicable under the Act;
	
	      (5)   contributor addresses that are not residential addresses within New York City;
	
	      (6)   contributions for which information is omitted from or illegible in a disclosure statement;
	
	      (7)   contributions made later than December 31 of the election year;
	
	      (8)   contributions originally received for elections other than the election in which the candidate is currently a participant, as described in 52 RCNY § 1-07;
	
	      (9)   matchable contribution claims that exceed the gross amount of the contribution;
	
	      (10)   contributions that were not received within the reporting period or that were made by post-dated check;
	
	      (11)   (i)   contributions totaling more than $99 for which a participant has not reported the contributor's occupation, employer, and business address;

	      (12)   contributions that were returned to or not paid by the contributor;
	
	      (13)   checks drawn by a person other than the contributor except checks signed by a contributor's authorized agent where the documentation required under 52 RCNY § 4-01(b)(2) has been maintained and provided;
	
	      (14)   contributions that are otherwise not matchable contributions within the meaning of the Act;
	
	      (15)   any information that suggests that a contribution has not been processed or reported in accordance with Program requirements;
	
	      (16)   any other information that suggests that matchable contribution claims may be invalid;
	
	      (17)   contributions for which a record required under 52 RCNY Chapter 4 was not kept or provided upon request;
	
	      (18)   contributions for which complete supporting documentation required by 52 RCNY § 3-04(a) has not been submitted;
	
	      (19)   check or money order contributions made payable to entities other than the committee that has reported receiving the contribution;
	
	      (20)   contributions that were made or accepted in violation of any federal, state, or local law;
	
	      (21)   contributions that were not contemporaneously reported as matchable in disclosure statements or were reported in such statements that were not filed in a complete and timely manner;
	
	      (22)   contribution checks drawn on business accounts, or accounts that bear indicia of being business accounts, such as the contributor's professional title;
	
	      (23)   contributions purportedly from different contributors that were made by money orders bearing consecutive serial numbers or other markings indicating that they were purchased simultaneously;
	
	      (24)   arithmetical errors in totals reported;

	      (26)   contributions required to be deposited into an account established for a runoff election, as provided in 52 RCNY § 2-06(c);
	
	      (27)   contributions from individuals, other than employees of the candidate's principal committee, who are vendors to the participant or individuals who have an interest in a vendor to the participant, unless the expenditure to the vendor is reimbursement for an advance. For the purposes of this rule, "individuals who have an interest in a vendor" shall mean individuals having an ownership interest of ten percent or more in a vendor or control over the vendor. An individual shall be deemed to have control over the vendor firm if the individual holds a management position, such as the position of officer, director or trustee;
	
	      (28)   contributions from individuals having business dealings with the city, as defined in § 3-702(18) of the Code, and contributions from lobbyists as defined in § 3-211 of the Code; and
	
	      (29)   contributions for which any person subject to the limitations of § 3-703(1-a) of the Code acted as an intermediary.
	
	   (e)   Withholding of public funds. The Board shall withhold five percent of the amount of public funds payable to a participant until the final pre-election payment for any election in which the participant is eligible to receive public funds. In addition, the Board, in its discretion, may withhold a reasonable portion of the amount of public funds payable to a participant based upon:
	
	      (1)   a projection of the rate(s) of invalid matchable contribution claims; and
	
	      (2)   the participant's failure to provide to the Board, upon its request, documents or records required by 52 RCNY Chapter 4, or other information.
	
	   (f)   Basis for ineligibility determination. The Board may determine that public funds shall not be paid to a participant if:
	
	      (1)   the participant has failed to meet one of the eligibility criteria of the Act or these Rules;
	
	      (2)   the participant is required to repay public funds previously received, as described in Rule 5-03, or the participant has failed to pay any outstanding claim of the Board for the payment of civil penalties or the repayment of public funds against such participant or his or her principal committee or a principal committee of such participant from a prior covered election, provided that the participant has received written notice of the potential payment obligation and potential ineligibility determination in advance of the certification deadline for the current covered election or an opportunity to present reasons for his or her eligibility for public funds to the Board;
	
	      (3)   the participant fails to submit a disclosure statement required by these rules;
	
	      (4)   the participant fails to provide to the Board, upon its request, documents or records required by 52 RCNY Chapter 4, or other information that verifies campaign activity;
	
	      (5)   previous public fund payments to the participant for the election equal the maximum permitted by the Act;
	
	      (6)   the participant fails to demonstrate compliance with § 12-110 of the Code, as required pursuant to § 3-703(1)(m) of the Code and 52 RCNY § 3-11;
	
	      (7)   the participant endorses or publicly supports his or her opponent for election pursuant to § 3-705(9) of the Code;
	
	      (8)   the participant loses in the primary election but remains on the ballot for the general election and fails to certify to the Board, as required by § 3-705(10) of the Code, that he or she will actively campaign for office in the general election, or the participant certifies to the Board that he or she will actively campaign for office in the general election but thereafter fails to engage in campaign activity that shall include but not be limited to, raising and spending funds, seeking endorsements, and broadly soliciting votes;
	
	      (9)   there is reason to believe that the participant or an agent of the participant has committed a violation of the Act or these Rules;
	
	      (10)   the participant or an agent of the participant has been found by the Board to have committed fraud in the course of Program participation or to be in breach of certification pursuant to Rule 2-02; or
	
	      (11)   there is reason to believe that the participant or an agent of the participant has engaged in conduct detrimental to the Program that is in violation of any other applicable law.
	
	   (g)   Payment is not final determination. Payments of public funds pursuant to this Rule shall not constitute the Board's final determination of the amount, if any, for which the participant qualifies. The Board shall provide specific notice of any such final determination.
	
	   (h)   Notice to participants. The Board shall notify participants of any difference between the amount claimed and amount paid. Subsequent payments may be, adjusted upward or downward to reflect further review and auditing of previous matchable contribution claims.
	
	   (i)   Pre-election payments.
	
	      (1)   Pursuant to § 3-709(5) and (6) of the Code: (i) no public funds shall be paid to participants in a primary or general election any earlier than four business days after the final day to file a written certification for such election, pursuant to paragraph (c) of subdivision 1 of Section 3-703 of the Code; (ii) no public funds shall be paid to participants in a runoff primary election or general election any earlier than the day after the day of the primary election held to nominate candidates for such election; and (iii) no public funds shall be paid to participants in a runoff special election held to fill a vacancy any earlier than the day after the day of the special election for which such runoff special election is held.
	
	      (2)   Pursuant to § 3-703(1)(a) and (5) of the Code, public funds are not payable to a participant who has not met the legal requirements to have his or her name on the ballot, who is unopposed, or, for the optional early public funds payment, who has not certified that he or she intends to meet all the requirements of law to have his or her name on the ballot.
	
	      (3)   The Board shall schedule at least three payment dates in the thirty days prior to a covered election, and the Board shall provide each participant a written determination specifying the basis for any payment or non-payment. As provided in 52 RCNY § 5-02(a), the participant may petition the Board in writing for a reconsideration of any such payment or non-payment determination, prior to the election, and such reconsideration shall occur within five business days of the filing of such petition.
	
	   (j)   Flat grants in special circumstances. Pursuant to § 3-705(5)(a) of the Code, the Board shall pay to a participant in a runoff primary election or runoff special election an amount equal to twenty-five cents for each one dollar of public funds paid to the participant for the preceding election. The amount paid pursuant to this subdivision may be adjusted to reflect further review and auditing of matchable contribution claims for the preceding election. The Board shall make payments pursuant to this subdivision within four business days after the date of the preceding election or as soon thereafter as practicable.
	
	   (k)   Post-payment audits. All determinations by the Board of eligibility and payment are subject to post-payment audit and final readjustment.
	
	   (l)   Characterization of payments as for the primary or general election.
	
	      (1)   If a participant is on the ballot and has an opponent on the ballot in both a primary and the general elections, payments made after the primary election will be characterized initially as follows:
	
	         (i)   As a primary election payment, if the payment is made on the basis of contribution and expenditure information reported in or before the disclosure statement due 10 days after the primary election, except as otherwise provided in subparagraph (ii).
	
	         (ii)   As a general election payment, to the extent that any further primary election payments would exceed a maximum applicable in the primary election pursuant to the Act.
	
	         (iii)   As a general election payment, if the payment is made on the basis of contribution and expenditure information reported in disclosure statements due later than 10 days after the primary election.
	
	      (2)   If the Board determines that payments characterized initially as either primary or general election payments were, in fact, used for qualified campaign expenditures incurred in the other election, the payments will be recharacterized accordingly, and additional payments may be made or repayments required, if appropriate. The total public funds used for qualified campaign expenditures in a single election may not exceed the maximum applicable pursuant to § 3-705(2) of the Code.
	
	   (m)   Post-election payments. After an election the Board may defer payment determinations for a participant until the completion of its audit of the participant. The Board shall not make payments based upon disclosure statement amendments or resubmissions filed (i) after December 31 in an election year, including but not limited to amendments or resubmissions of the disclosure statement due the first January 15 after the election, or (ii) after the final disclosure statement in the case of a special election; provided however, that the Board may make payments based upon such amendments or resubmissions solely if they are made in response to invalid matching claims reports to which the Board has requested a response after December 31 in an election year or after the final special election disclosure statement, as the case may be.
	
	   (n)   Deductions from payments.
	
	      (1)   The total amount of public funds payable to a participant for a covered primary, general, or special election shall be reduced by the sum of the following:
	
	         (i)   the amount of outstanding civil penalties assessed by the Board as a result of the participant's failure to comply with the Act and these Rules during the current covered election; and
	
	         (ii)   the amount of the participant's:
	
	            (A)   transfers and other disbursements from a political committee that is involved in an election in which the candidate is currently a participant, to a political committee that is not involved in that election;
	
	            (B)   expenditures made to pay expenses for or debt from a previous election, including repayments of public funds and payment of penalties owed to the Board for a previous election;
	
	            (C)   contributions to other political committees that do not meet the requirements provided in § 3-705(8) of the Code for contributions that shall not be a basis for reducing public funds payments; and
	
	            (D)   loans to other candidates that are not repaid within 30 days or by the date of the election, whichever is earlier, or spending for other candidates, including joint expenditures, to the extent such expenditures benefit another candidate, and independent expenditures; provided that independent expenditures made by the principal committee of a participant shall not be a basis for reducing public funds payments to that participant, where such expenditures do not, in the aggregate, exceed the amount provided in §§ 3-705(8)(i), (ii), or (iii) of the Code, as applicable, for contributions to political committees;
	
	            (E)   loans to or spending for political party committees and political clubs that are not reimbursed within 30 days or by the date of the election, whichever is earlier, provided that if the participant demonstrates that the expenditure was for a tangible item that directly promotes the participant's election, such as an advertisement in a fundraising journal, this subdivision shall not apply to the fair market value of that item; and
	
	            (F)   expenditures made for the purpose of furthering the participant's election to the position of Speaker of the City Council.
	
	      (2)   Disbursements that would otherwise result in a deduction pursuant to subparagraph (ii) of paragraph (1) of this subdivision shall not result in any such deduction if:
	
	         (i)   such disbursements are made out of a segregated bank account;
	
	         (ii)   at no time does the segregated bank account contain any funds other than contributions received by the participant and deposited directly into the account pursuant to this Rule, and bank interest paid thereon;
	
	         (iii)   funds deposited into the segregated bank account are not used for any purpose other than disbursements governed by subparagraph (ii) of paragraph (1) above or payment of bank fees associated with the segregated bank account;
	
	         (iv)   contributors whose contributions are deposited into the segregated bank account have confirmed in writing, pursuant to Rule 4-01(b) (3)(ii)(C), that they understand that these contributions will only be used for such disbursements and will not be matched with public funds;
	
	         (v)   copies of such written confirmations are submitted to the Board by the due date for the disclosure statement in which such contributions are required to be reported pursuant to these Rules;
	
	         (vi)   copies of checks for each disbursement out of the segregated bank account are submitted to the Board by the due date for the disclosure statement in which such disbursements are required to be reported pursuant to these Rules;
	
	         (vii)   a copy of each bank statement for the segregated bank account is submitted to the Board by the due date for the next disclosure statement; and
	
	         (viii)   for each individual contribution deposited into the segregated bank account, and each disbursement out of the segregated bank account, the participant has complied with all other applicable provisions of the Act and these Rules, including but not limited to the record keeping and reporting provisions.
	
	      (3)   Participants shall deposit the entire amount of a contribution into the segregated bank account provided for in paragraph (2), and may not divide the contribution between different accounts.
	
	      (4)   Contributions deposited into a segregated bank account pursuant to this Rule will not be matched with public funds.
	
	      (5)   Any funds remaining in a segregated bank account after the election must be returned to the contributors whose contributions were deposited into the account, or, if that is impracticable, to the Fund, on or before December 31 in the year following the year of the election.
	
	      (6)   A participant who establishes a segregated bank account pursuant to this Rule, but fails to comply with any provision of paragraph (2), (3), (4), or (5) of this subdivision, shall no longer be entitled to the exception from paragraph (1) contained in paragraph (2) of this subdivision.
	
	      (7)   Funds deposited into, and disbursements made from, a segregated bank account established and maintained in compliance with this Rule for the purpose of making expenditures to pay expenses for or debt from a previous election, including repayments of public funds owed to the Board, will not be considered to be raised or spent for the current covered election for purposes of the participant's expenditure limit calculation.
	
	   (o)   Use of final payment. Before the Board makes final payment, the participant shall submit to the Board bills or other documentation of outstanding debt for which the final public funds payment will be used. Within 60 days after the final public funds payment, the participant must demonstrate that the public funds were used to pay such outstanding debt or shall repay the public funds to the Board.
	
	   (p)   Responding to invalid matching claims reports. In the event that the Board concludes that one or more of a participant's matchable contribution claims are invalid, a participant responding to the Board's report shall do so by the March 15 following the election or 60 days after receiving the report, whichever is later. In the case of a special election, a participant shall respond to an invalid matching claims report no later than 60 days after receiving the report.
	
	   (q)   Ballot disqualification by Board of Elections; candidate not opposed on the ballot. The Board will not make payment to any participant disqualified from the ballot by the Board of Elections or by a court, or to any participant for an election in which all other candidates have been disqualified from the ballot by the Board of Elections or by a court, until after such participant or other candidate, as the case may be, is restored to the ballot by a subsequent determination by a court of competent jurisdiction. A participant who appears as the only candidate on the ballot in an election shall not be eligible to receive public funds, notwithstanding any write-in candidates in that election, except as otherwise provided in Rule 5-02(b).
	
	   (r)   Reduction in maximum public funds payable. Pursuant to § 3-705 of the Act, the maximum amount of public funds a participant may otherwise be eligible to receive will be reduced by the sum of the following:
	
	      (1)   any public funds retained by the Board in lieu of civil penalties;
	
	      (2)   any public funds retained by the Board in lieu of funds the participant is required to pay back to the Fund pursuant to the Act;
	
	      (3)   any public funds withheld pursuant to Rule 5-01(e)(2); and
	
	      (4)   pursuant to § 3-703(1-b) of the Code, an amount equal to the total unreturned contributions in excess of the limitations applicable to persons having business dealings with the city.
	
	   (s)   Approval by Board subject to correction of limited, isolated, and easily corrected compliance issues. The Board, in its discretion, may approve a public funds payment to a participant, notwithstanding that the participant has been determined by the Board to be ineligible to receive public funds because of limited, isolated, and easily corrected compliance issues. Such approval of public funds disbursement shall be conditioned upon a satisfactory demonstration by the participant that it has taken action, as specified by the Board and within a period of time specified by the Board, to comply with the Act and these rules. The participant shall have the burden of demonstrating to the Board that it has fully complied with the Board's requirements.

§ 5-02 Review of Eligibility, Payment, and Repayment Determinations. ::


	   (a)    Written petitions for review.
	
	      (1)   After the Board provides a participant a written determination specifying the basis for payment or non-payment of public funds prior to the election, the participant may petition the Board in writing for reconsideration of such determination. Such petition must state the grounds for reconsideration and may include a request to appear before the Board concerning the subject of such petition. Before the election, the Board shall review the determination that is the subject of the petition for review within five business days of the filing of such petition. In the event the Board is unable to convene within five business days, the Board may delegate to the Chair of the Board or his or her designee authority to make a determination regarding the petition. The Board shall timely issue a written determination on the subject of the petition. If the petition is denied, the Board's notice shall inform the participant of the right to appeal the Board's determination pursuant to Article 78 of the Civil Practice Law and Rules.
	
	      (2)   The participating candidate and his or her principal committee shall not include in any such petition any documentation or factual information not submitted to the Board prior to the determination under review unless the participating candidate can demonstrate good cause for the previous failure to submit such documentation or information and for any failures to communicate on a timely basis with the Board.
	
	      (3)   The participating candidate may submit a petition for review of a payment or non-payment determination after the issuance of the participant's final audit report within thirty days of issuance of the final audit report and only upon submission of information and/or documentation that was unavailable to the Board previously and is material to such determination, and a showing that the participant had good cause for the previous failure to provide such information and/or documentation.
	
	   (b)   Final disqualification from the ballot. The Board will consider a candidate to be finally disqualified from the ballot on the earlier of the date of an administrative or judicial determination disqualifying the candidate for which there is no appeal as of right (unless the disqualification is reversed on appeal or otherwise) or of the election. Payment may be made to a participant who was temporarily on the ballot or opposed in an election, pursuant to a determination of the Board of Elections or a court of competent jurisdiction, but then ultimately disqualified from the ballot or unopposed in that election, only when the Board's audit of the participant's campaign has been completed and only if the participant has, within 30 days after the date of the final disqualification, as provided herein, filed a written petition, sworn to or affirmed, and supporting documentation that demonstrates that:
	
	      (1)   liabilities in qualified campaign expenditures incurred before the date of final disqualification remain unpaid;
	
	      (2)   the total amount of cash on hand is insufficient to pay these liabilities;
	
	      (3)   hardship will exist if public funds are not paid;
	
	      (4)   any and all expenditures made and liabilities incurred after the final disqualification were reasonable and necessary; and
	
	      (5)   the campaign was otherwise eligible and in compliance with all other Program requirements as of the date of final disqualification and has remained in compliance at all times since that date. The petition shall also include an undertaking to use any public funds paid for extinguishing the liabilities enumerated pursuant to paragraph (1).




§ 5-03 Repaying Public Funds. ::


	   (a)    Participants returning public funds. Participants returning public funds shall make a check payable or endorse the public fund check to the "New York City Election Campaign Finance Fund." Participants may not reclaim public funds they have returned.
	
	   (b)   Participant is disqualified from the ballot.
	
	      (1)   Pursuant to § 3-709(7) of the Code, a participant who has been finally disqualified or whose designating or nominating petitions have been finally declared invalid by the New York City Board of Elections or a court of competent jurisdiction, may not thereafter spend public funds for any purpose other than the payment of previous liabilities incurred in qualified campaign expenditures. All public funds in excess of such liabilities previously incurred shall be promptly repaid to the Board; the amount to be repaid shall be determined in accordance with § 3-710(2)(b) of the Code and subdivision (d). A repayment made pursuant to § 3-709(7) shall not preclude a determination that an additional repayment is required pursuant to that or any other provision of the Act.
	
	      (2)   Pursuant to § 3-710(3) of the Code, a participant who has been disqualified by a court of competent jurisdiction on the grounds that he or she committed fraudulent acts in order to obtain a place on the ballot, and such decision is not reversed, shall pay to the Board an amount equal to the total public funds paid to the participant. Payments required pursuant to this paragraph shall be made promptly upon such final deter- mination.
	
	   (c)   Excess public fund payments. Pursuant to § 3-710(2)(a) of the Code, the Board shall notify a participant in writing if public funds paid to the participant were in excess of the aggregate amount for which the participant qualified, and such participant shall pay to the Board an amount equal to the amount of the excess payments.
	
	   (d)   Improper use of public funds. Pursuant to § 3-710(2)(b) of the Code, the Board shall notify a participant in writing if it finds that public funds paid to the participant were used for purposes other than qualified campaign expenditures and the participant shall repay to the Board any improperly used public funds; provided, however, that in considering whether or not a participating candidate shall be required to pay to the Board such amount or an amount less than the entire amount to be repaid, the Board shall act in accordance with the following: (i) where credible documentation supporting each qualified campaign expenditure exists but is incomplete, the Board shall not impose such liability for such expenditure; (ii) where there is an absence of credible documentation for each qualified campaign expenditure, the Board may impose liability upon a showing that such absence of credible documentation for such expenditure arose from a lack of adequate controls including, but not limited to trained staff, internal procedures to follow published Board guidelines and procedures to follow standard financial controls.
	
	   (e)   Unspent campaign funds.
	
	      (1)   Pursuant to § 3-710(2)(c) of the Code, the Board shall notify a participant in writing if it finds that the participant owes unspent campaign funds to the Board. The participant shall promptly pay to the Board unspent campaign funds from an election; provided, however, that all unspent campaign funds for a participant shall be immediately due and payable to the Board upon a determination by the Board that the participant has delayed the post-election audit process. The participant shall promptly pay to the Board any additional unspent campaign funds based upon a determination made by the Board at a subsequent date. The amount of unspent campaign funds shall be presumed to be equal to the participant's authorized committee bank account balance on January 11 in the year following the election, or for special elections, on the last day of the reporting period for the final disclosure statement the candidate is required to file with the Board for such election, less any permissible documented post-election expenditures pursuant to subparagraph (ii) of paragraph (2) of this subdivision. The Board may also consider information revealed in the course of an audit or investigation in making an unspent campaign funds determination, including, but not limited to, the fact that campaign expenditures were made in violation of law, that expenditures were made for any purpose other than the furtherance of the participant's nomination or election, or that the participant has not maintained or provided requested documentation. If a participant repays to the Fund all funds remaining in his or her authorized committee bank account on or before December 31 in the year of the election, or, for special elections, on or before the last day of the month following the month in which the election took place, such participant shall be presumed not to owe additional unspent funds, provided that any contributions received and expenditures made after such funds are repaid must be raised and spent in compliance with the Act and these Rules.
	
	      (2)   (i)  A participant may not use receipts for any purpose other than disbursements in the preceding election until all unspent campaign funds have been repaid, except as otherwise provided in Rule 1-03(b). Notwithstanding the presumption of Rule 1-08(c)(1), a participant has the burden of demonstrating that a post-election expenditure is for the preceding election.
	
	         (ii)   Before repaying unspent campaign funds, a participant may make post-election expenditures only for routine activities involving nominal cost associated with winding up a campaign and responding to the post-election audit. Such expenditures may include: payment of utility bills and rent; reasonable staff salaries and consultancy fees for responding to a post-election audit; reasonable staff salaries and legal fees incurred prior to the date of the issuance of the participant's final audit report and associated with defending against a claim that public funds must be repaid; a post-election event for staff, volunteers, and/or supporters held within thirty days of the election; reasonable moving expenses related to closing the campaign office; a holiday card mailing to contributors, campaign volunteers, and staff; thank you notes for contributors, campaign volunteers, and staff; payment of taxes and other reasonable expenses for compliance with applicable tax laws; and interest expense. Routine post-election expenditures that may be paid for with unspent campaign funds do not include such items as post-election mailings other than as specifically provided for in this subparagraph; making contributions; or making bonus payments or gifts to staff or volunteers. Unspent campaign funds may not be used for transition and inauguration activities.
	
	         (iii)   Notwithstanding the restriction on the use of receipts provided in subdivision (2)(i), a participant who has outstanding liabilities from the election, including a participant who owes public funds or penalties to the Board, may make post-election expenditures for the purpose of raising funds to repay such debt, provided, however, that such expenditures and any contributions received shall be included in the participant's unspent funds calculation unless such expenditures and contributions are incurred or received after the date of the issuance of the participant's final audit report.
	
	   (f)   Other reasons for repayment. The Board shall notify a participant of any amount of public funds to be repaid because:
	
	         (i)   the participant has not maintained copies of checks or contribution cards that document matchable contributions; or
	
	         (ii)   the public funds paid were based on contributions that have been returned or contribution checks that have not been paid; or
	
	         (iii)   the participant has failed to demonstrate eligibility for the public funds paid or compliance with Program requirements, or both; or
	
	         (iv)   a determination pursuant to § 3-705(6), (7), or § 3-706(3) of the Code is reversed following reconsideration pursuant to Rule 7-03(k).
	
	   (g)   Repayment determinations. The participant shall promptly repay public funds upon any determination made by the Board that a repayment is required pursuant to the Act and this rule. Any claim for the repayment of public funds shall be based on a final determination issued by the Board following an adjudication pursuant to Rule 7-02(f), unless such adjudication is waived by the candidate or principal committee.
	
	




§ 5-04 Fund Administration. ::


	To safeguard the administration of the Fund and assure candidates that sufficient public funds will be available to make all payments required by the Act in upcoming elections, as guaranteed to participants by Charter § 1052(a)(10), the Board shall:
	
	   (a)   make budget requests for the Fund sufficient to cover all anticipated Fund obligations in the upcoming fiscal year and to maintain a reserve for contingencies;
	
	   (b)   when it has determined that monies in the Fund are insufficient or likely to be insufficient for payments to participants, report this determination to the Commissioner of Finance and provide its estimate of the additional amount which will be necessary to make such payments pursuant to the Act (together with a detailed statement of the assumptions and methodologies on which the estimate is based), as required by Charter § 1052(a)(10), not more than four days after which the Commissioner of Finance is required by Charter § 1052(a)(10) to transfer an amount equal to the Board's estimate from the City's general fund to the Fund;
	
	   (c)   take steps to ensure that the Fund is maintained in a separate account, credited with all sums appropriated therefor and all earnings accruing thereon, in the custody of the comptroller on behalf of the Board, as required by Charter § 1052(a)(10);
	
	   (d)   take steps to ensure that the Fund and its administration are insulated from the risk of improper action by any City official or agency or any agent or contractor thereof; (e)  subject the Fund to periodic audits by independent outside auditors; and
	
	   (f)   take such other actions as are necessary and proper to insure the integrity of the Fund.

	      (1)   upon receipt of a written request to inspect records:
	
	         (i)   make the records available for inspection; or

	      (2)   upon written request for copies of records:
	
	         (i)   make a copy available upon payment or offer to pay fees, if any, in accordance with this Rule; or
	
	         (ii)   deny the request for copies of records in whole or in part and explain in writing the reasons for the denial;
	
	      (3)   upon written request, certify that a record is a true copy; and
	
	      (4)   upon failure to locate records pursuant to a written request, certify that:
	
	         (i)   the Board is not the custodian for such records; or
	
	         (ii)   the records of which the Board is a custodian cannot be found after diligent search.
	
	   (b)   Record location, availability, and use. Records shall be available for public inspection and copying at the offices of the Board. Requests for public access to records shall be accepted and records produced during the hours of 10 a.m.-4 p.m., Monday through Friday. The records access officer, or his or her designee, shall have the discretion to limit the number of records a requester may receive at any one time. No marks of any kind shall be made by a requester on any record provided for inspection. Inspection or copying of records shall be permitted only in the area designated by the records access officer for such purpose.
	
	   (c)   Requests for access. Board staff may require a written request for access to records, but oral requests may be accepted when records are readily available. A response shall be given regarding any written request reasonably describing records sought within 5 business days of receipt of the request. A request shall reasonably describe the records sought. Whenever possible, a requester shall supply information regarding dates, file designations, or other information that may describe the records sought and enable the efficient location of the records. If the records access officer does not grant or deny access to records sought within 5 business days of receipt of a written request, he or she shall furnish a written acknowledgment of receipt of the request and a statement of the approximate date on which the request will be granted or denied. If circumstances prevent disclosure to the requester within 20 business days from the date of the acknowledgment of the receipt of the request, the Board shall state in writing the reason for the inability to grant the request within 20 business days and a date certain within a reasonable period, depending on the circumstances, when the request will be granted.
	
	   (d)   Denial of access. Denial of access to records shall be made in writing stating the reason for the denial and advising the requester of the right to appeal. The Board's Executive Director or the Executive Director's designee shall hear appeals from denial of access to records. The time for deciding an appeal shall commence upon receipt of a dated written appeal, including:
	
	      (1)   the date of the denial of access; and
	
	      (2)   the name and return address of the requester. The Executive Director or the Executive Director's designee shall transmit to the Committee on Open Government copies of all appeals upon receipt. The Executive Director or the Executive Director's designee shall inform the requester and the Committee on Open Government of a decision on the appeal, in writing, within 10 business days of receipt of an appeal.
	
	   (e)   Fees. The Board may charge 25 cents per page for photocopies not exceeding 9 inches by 14 inches or the actual cost of reproducing any other record. In determining the actual cost, the Board may include: (i) an amount equal to the hourly salary attributed to the lowest paid Board employee who has the necessary skill required to prepare a copy of the requested record, except that no fee shall be charged for staff time if less than two hours is needed to prepare a copy of the requested record; (ii) the actual cost of storage devices or media provided to the requester in complying with the request; and (iii) the actual cost to the Board of engaging an outside professional service to prepare a copy of a record, where the Board's information technology equipment is inadequate to prepare a copy.

	   (e)   Opportunity to respond to complaint. Within 20 days from mailing by the Board of a copy of the complaint to a respondent, or within such lesser time as may be specified by the Board for complaints received less than 40 days before the election, the respondent may submit a verified answer, which may set forth reasons why the Board should dismiss the complaint. If, based upon its review of the complaint and any answer filed, the Board determines the complaint to be lacking in merit, the Board shall dismiss the complaint.
	
	   (f)   Investigation. Following receipt of a complaint, or at any time, if acting on its own initiative, the Board may conduct an investigation into possible violations of the Charter, Act or these Rules. In its investigation, the Board may use its investigative powers pursuant to §§ 3-708(5) and 3-710(1) of the Code. An investigation may include, but is not limited to, field investigations, desk and field audits, the issuance of subpoenas, the taking of sworn testimony, the issuance of document requests and interrogatories, and other methods of information gathering.




§ 7-02 Board Determinations. ::


	   (a)    Determination that complaint lacks merit. Following an investigation, the Board may determine that a complaint is lacking in merit or that violations of the Charter, Act and these Rules have not been substantiated and dismiss the complaint or terminate the investigation.
	
	   (b)   Participant not eligible for public funds. Following an investigation, the Board may make a determination that a participant is ineligible to receive public funds.

	   (c)   Notice and opportunity to contest.
	
	      (1)   If the Board has reason to believe that a violation of a law or rule over which the Board has jurisdiction has occurred, and/or that a participant must repay public funds to the Board, the Board shall notify the candidate and treasurer in writing of the alleged violation and proposed civil penalty and/or of the amount of the alleged public funds repayment obligation. Such notice shall:

	         (ii)   notify the candidate and treasurer of the opportunity to submit information and documentation for the Board's consideration within a reasonable time period to be specified in such notice; and
	
	         (iii)   notify the candidate and treasurer of the opportunity to appear before the Board or its designee at a hearing to contest the alleged violation and proposed civil penalty and/or the alleged public funds repayment obligation.
	
	      (2)   Unless specifically notified to the contrary by the Board, the opportunity to submit information and documentation described in the notice shall be the only such opportunity, and any information and documentation that is not timely received by the Board may, at the Board's sole discretion, be disregarded.
	
	      (3)   The notice shall inform the candidate and treasurer that hearings are conducted in accordance with the requirements for adjudications contained in section 1046 of the Charter unless such procedures are waived by the candidate or principal committee.
	
	      (4)   Following this opportunity to submit information and documentation, consideration of any information and documentation submitted, and consideration of any appearance before the Board or its designee, the Board may determine the amount of civil penalties for any violations it determines to have occurred and/or the amount of public funds repayment obligation, and shall provide notice setting forth in detail the legal basis of the Board's determination. If these amounts, as determined by the Board, are not paid by the payment deadline set forth in the notice, they may be sought through appropriate enforcement action or, in the case of civil penalties, by deduction from any public funds otherwise due for any election.
	
	   (d)   Conciliation.
	
	      (1)   Upon review of a respondent's submission, or if the Board otherwise has reason to believe that a violation of a law or rule over which the Board has jurisdiction has occurred, the Board may initiate conciliation procedures. For this purpose the Board may conduct a conciliation conference. Notice of the conference shall be served on those parties whose attendance the Board considers necessary.
	
	      (2)   If terms of conciliation which are satisfactory to the parties are reached, a conciliation agreement shall be signed by the parties subject to its terms and by the Board's Executive Director, on the Board's behalf. This agreement may require payment of appropriate civil penalties for violations as determined by the Board. If the amounts to be paid as provided for in the agreement are not paid, they may be sought through appropriate enforcement action or by deduction from any public funds otherwise due for any election. Upon execution of such an agreement, the Board shall administratively close the case. Conciliation agreements shall be binding on all parties. In the event the Board has reason to believe that terms and conditions of the agreement have not been complied with, or if new facts are brought to the Board's attention, the Board may, in its discretion, re-open the case and/or bring an appropriate enforcement proceeding.
	
	      (3)   Conciliation procedures are not part of the Board's standard practices, but may be appropriate to address novel issues and are conducted solely at the discretion of the Board.
	
	   (f)   Adjudications in accordance with § 1046 of the Charter.
	
	      (1)   Adjudications pursuant to this rule shall be conducted by one or more hearing officers. The Board, at its sole discretion, may designate one or more members of the Board and/or an administrative law judge to act as hearing officers. One or more members of the Board's staff may provide legal and procedural advice to the hearing officer and to the Board, subject to the direction of the hearing officer(s).
	
	      (2)   The Board shall commence an adjudication pursuant to this rule by serving a notice containing a statement of the nature of the proceeding, the legal authority and jurisdiction under which the hearing is to be held, and a short and plain statement of the matters to be adjudicated, including reference to the particular sections of the Charter, Act, and these Rules involved.
	
	      (3)   The Board shall provide written notice of the time and place of the hearing to the candidate and treasurer.
	
	      (4)   The candidate and treasurer must provide to the hearing officer(s) and Board staff a substantive written response to the notice stating the defense to the notice at least two weeks prior to the date of the hearing.

	      (5)   The names and contact information of all persons wishing to present testimony on the law or the facts at the hearing, including any witnesses to be examined, must be provided to the hearing officer(s) and Board staff at least five business days prior to the date of the hearing.
	
	      (6)   The hearing officer(s) shall administer oaths, subpoena and examine witnesses, receive written and oral testimony, rule on the admissibility of evidence, and decide all other aspects of the conduct of the hearing. Findings of fact shall be based exclusively on the record of the proceeding as a whole. The hearing officer(s) shall make findings of fact and conclusions of law and shall forward a recommended final determination to the Board along with the record of the adjudication upon which the recommended determination is based. The Board may adopt, reject or modify any recommended determination.
	
	      (7)   The candidate and treasurer shall be afforded due process of law, including the opportunity to be represented by counsel, to request that a subpoena be issued, to call witnesses, to cross-examine opposing witnesses and to present oral and written arguments on the law and facts.

	      (8)   Testimony and argument on the law and facts shall be presented in the following order: Board staff, witnesses called by Board staff, if any, cross-examination, the candidate and/or treasurer and/or their counsel, witnesses called by the candidate and/or treasurer and/or their counsel, and cross-examination. Each party shall be afforded an opportunity to present rebuttal testimony, if deemed appropriate by the hearing officer.

	      (11)   Affidavits or affirmations submitted as evidence must be signed and under penalties of perjury. Failure of the respondent to produce at a hearing any document either requested by the Board or required to be maintained by the Board pursuant to the Act and these Rules shall lead to a rebuttable presumption that the document, if produced, would have been adverse to the respondent.
	
	      (12)   Once the hearing officer has issued the recommended final determination, each party shall have twenty days to submit written comments to the Board. The comments should raise any objections to the recommended determination, and objections not raised in the comments will be deemed waived in any further proceedings. Comments shall be limited to the record of the adjudicatory proceeding. Comments shall be served upon all other parties, and shall be served upon the Board by the Office of the General Counsel. Upon application filed with the Office of the General Counsel, the Chair may shorten or extend the time for comments for good cause shown.

	   (g)   Penalties for Disclosure Statement and Contribution Violations. The Board shall publicize staff guidelines for presumptive penalties to be recommended for the late submission of a disclosure statement, the failure to file a disclosure statement, and the acceptance of an over-the-limit or a prohibited contribution, subject to consideration of aggravating and mitigating factors that will be considered in determining the appropriate penalty assessment for the violation.




§ 7-03 Review of Contributions and Expenditures. ::


	   (a)    Determination of eligibility.
	
	      (1)   Pursuant to § 3-705(6) of the Code, the Board shall determine whether a limited participant or a non-participant has spent or contracted or become obligated to spend an amount which, in the aggregate, exceeds ten thousand dollars; (2) pursuant to § 3-705(7)(a) of the Code, the Board shall determine whether a candidate has spent or contracted or become obligated to spend, or received in loans or contributions, or both, an amount which, in the aggregate, exceeds one-fifth of the applicable expenditure limit for such office as provided by § 3-706(1) of the Code; (3) pursuant to § 3-706(3)(a) of the Code, the Board shall determine whether a non-participant has spent or contracted or become obligated to spend, or received in loans or contributions, or both, an amount which, in the aggregate, exceeds one-half the expenditure limit applicable to the participant(s) and/or limited participant(s) opposing that candidate; (4) pursuant to § 3-706(3)(b) of the Code, the Board shall determine whether a non-participant has spent or contracted or become obligated to spend, or received in loans or contributions, or both, an amount which, in the aggregate, exceeds three times the expenditure limit applicable to the participant(s) and/or limited participant(s) opposing that candidate; and (5) the Board shall verify the truthfulness of any certified signed statement submitted pursuant to § 3-705(7)(b) of the Code and the Board shall determine whether supporting documentation submitted pursuant to § 3-705(7)(b) of the Code demonstrates the existence of the condition or conditions described in such statement. For the purposes of making a determination pursuant to § 3-705(7)(b)(1) of the Code, a non-participating or a limited participating candidate shall be presumed to have the ability to self finance when it is demonstrated through supporting documentation that such candidate has readily available funds in excess of one-fifth of the applicable expenditure limit and that such candidate can reasonably be expected to spend such funds for his or her nomination or election.
	
	   (b)   Generally. To permit the Board to make these determinations in a timely, fair, and efficient manner, pursuant to the Act, it is expected that participants, limited participants, and non-participants will cooperate fully with Board requests for information and adhere to the procedures set forth in this rule and the requirements of New York Election Law Article 14 and State Board of Elections regulations.
	
	   (c)   Facial determinations. The Board may find that a candidate's forms submitted to the Campaign Finance Board or to the Board of Elections provide on their face a sufficient basis for a determination pursuant to paragraph (a) above. The Board will presume that contributions and loans are accepted, disbursements are made, and liabilities are incurred by a candidate for his or her next following election. In the absence of evidence indicating otherwise, the Board will rely upon the date of contributions, loans, disbursements, and liabilities as they appear on forms submitted to the Campaign Finance Board or the Board of Elections. In addition, the Board will presume that cash on hand after an election consists of contributions that are available for expenditure in the next election.
	
	   (d)   Petitions. The Board may make a determination pursuant to paragraph (a) above following the submission of a written pebtition, as provided in this rule. The written petition shall:
	
	      (1)   be sworn to or affirmed;
	
	      (2)   indicate the participant or limited participant on whose behalf it is submitted, if any;
	
	      (3)   specify the particular information contained in forms submitted to the Campaign Finance Board or the Board of Elections on behalf of the respondent that is alleged to be inaccurate, if any, and the particular information alleged to be omitted from those forms, if any (in the absence of these allegations, the Board will presume that any forms on file at the Campaign Finance Board or the Board of Elections at the time the petition is submitted are true and complete for the applicable reporting periods);
	
	      (4)   identify specific fund-raising and/or spending activities on behalf of the respondent that are alleged to have taken place after the close of the reporting period covered by the last such forms submitted on behalf of the respondent, if any;
	
	      (5)   include all relevant names, dates, and amounts pertaining to monetary and in-kind contributions, and vendors providing goods and services to the respondent or to a third party on behalf of the respondent, including information concerning the fair market value of services, materials, facilities, advertising, or other things of value reported to have been received or expended on his or her behalf; and
	
	      (6)   contain information about statements reported to have been made by the respondent, his or her agents, or authorized representatives, and any other relevant infor- mation. The Board will not consider petitions submitted after the due date for the last disclosure statement required to be filed with the Campaign Finance Board by any candidate in the election for which the petition is filed.
	
	   (e)   Petitioner's burden. The petitioner shall submit with the petition evidence that supports the allegations made in the petition, including but not limited to the information described in paragraph (d)(5). The petitioner has the burden of demonstrating a sufficient basis for a determination pursuant to paragraph (a). Failure by the respondent to file required disclosure forms may be a sufficient basis, and must be addressed in the respondent's response to the petition.
	
	   (f)   Notice of petition. The Board shall send a copy of the petition to the respondent, any opposing participants, and, in the case of a determination pursuant to § 3-706(a) or (b) of the Code, any opposing limited participants. The notice shall specify:
	
	      (1)   the deadline for the respondent to submit a response, pursuant to subdivision (g);
	
	      (2)   the deadline for opposing participants or limited participants other than a respondent to submit petitions for consideration at any hearing referred to in the notice; and
	
	      (3)   the date and time at which the Board will conduct a hearing on the petition, if any, pursuant to subdivision (h).
	
	   (g)   Response to the petition. The respondent shall submit a response in such manner as may be provided by the Board. The response shall:
	
	      (1)   be sworn to or affirmed;
	
	      (2)   either:
	
	         (i)   acknowledge that fund-raising or spending on behalf of the respondent is sufficient to permit the Board to make a determination pursuant to paragraph (a), regardless of the merit of the petitioning participant's or limited participant's particular allegations; or
	
	         (ii)   contend that a determination pursuant to paragraph (a) would be inappropriate and specify the allegations in the petition that are denied and those that are admitted;
	
	      (3)   explain any failure to file any forms required in the election year; and
	
	      (4)   be signed by the respondent or his or her treasurer. The respondent shall submit with the response evidence that supports the response, including, but not limited to, all relevant names, dates, and amounts pertaining to monetary and in-kind contributions, and vendors providing goods and services to the respondent or to a third party on his or her behalf, including information concerning the fair market value of services, materials, facilities, advertising, or other things of value reported to have been received or expended on behalf of the respondent. A failure to submit a response may be deemed an admission that there is a sufficient basis for a determination pursuant to paragraph (a).
	
	   (h)   Hearing.
	
	      (1)   The petitioner, the respondent, or an opposing participant or limited participant other than a respondent may request the Board to conduct a hearing on the petition.
	
	      (2)   If the Board determines to conduct a hearing, as requested or on its own initiative, the hearing date will be no earlier than 10 days after the petition is received, except:
	
	         (i)   for good cause shown; or
	
	         (ii)   for petitions received less than 30 days before the election, in which case the hearing date will be no earlier than 3 days after the petition is received.
	
	      (3)   The respondent and each opposing participant or limited participant shall notify the Board no less than one day in advance whether they will be represented at the hearing and, if the petitioner or the respondent will not be represented, the reason for the absence. Representation of a party at a hearing must be by a person with knowledge of the facts at issue.
	
	      (4)   At the hearing, testimony given may be under oath, recorded, and in the following order:
	
	         (i)   the petitioner;
	
	         (ii)   opposing participants and/or limited participants other than a respondent;
	
	         (iii)   the respondent;
	
	         (iv)   Board staff, if appropriate; and
	
	         (v)   an opportunity for each party to rebut, if deemed appropriate by the Board.
	
	         (i)   Notice of determination. Following the review of disclosure forms, the submission of a petition and an opportunity for a response, and/or a hearing, the Board will decide whether there is a sufficient basis for a determination pursuant to paragraph (a). The Board shall provide written notice to the respondent, all opposing participants and limited participants other than a respondent, and the petitioner, if any, of a determination pursuant to paragraph (a) or a decision not to make such a determination, as requested by a petition, and the basis therefor.
	
	   (j)   New petitions. A decision not to make a determination pursuant to paragraph (a) shall not be construed to preclude the subsequent submission of any petition for a determination respecting that candidate.
	
	   (k)   Reconsideration. The petitioner, the respondent, or an opposing participant or limited participant other than a respondent may request that the Board reconsider the determination pursuant to paragraph (a) or the decision not to make such a determination. This request shall be made in writing no later than 10 days after the determination or decision. A request for reconsideration from a respondent must also include: (1) an affidavit of the respondent or his or her treasurer affirming that neither fundraising nor spending on behalf of the respondent that has taken place after the close of the most recent reporting period is sufficient to permit the Board to make a determination pursuant to paragraph (a); and (2) an undertaking by the respondent or treasurer to notify the Board immediately in writing if and when either fund-raising or spending on behalf of the respondent becomes sufficient to permit the Board to make a determination pursuant to paragraph (a). The Board may consider a respondent's failure to respond to the petition, or the failure of the party requesting reconsideration to be represented at a hearing on the petition, to be a sufficient basis for denying a request for reconsideration. The Board shall notify the respondent, all opposing participants, and, in the case of a determination pursuant to § 3-706(a) or (b) of the Code, all opposing limited participants, and the petitioner on whether it will reconsider the determination pursuant to paragraph (a) or decide not to make such a determination, as the case may be. If the Board grants reconsideration and determines to conduct a hearing, the hearing shall be conducted in the manner described in paragraph (h)(4).
	
	   (l)   Submission of false information. If the Board has reason to believe that a candidate or any other person has knowingly submitted false information or fabricated evidence or has knowingly withheld or concealed information, relevant to a determination under paragraph (a), the Board shall refer the matter to the appropriate agency for criminal prosecution and may commence a civil action to recover public funds and/or civil penalties, if appropriate.




§ 7-04 Advisory Opinions. ::


	Upon the written request of a candidate or any other person, the Board shall issue advisory opinions interpreting the Act and these rules, or otherwise respond in writing to the request, within thirty days of receipt of such request, or within ten business days of receipt if such request is received less than thirty days before a covered election, to the extent practicable.

	   (b)   Adjustment of Expenditure Limits. Pursuant to § 3-706(1)(e) of the Code, not later than the first day of March in the year 2010, and every fourth year thereafter, the Board shall adjust the expenditure limits applicable pursuant to § 3-706(1) and (2) in accordance with changes in the consumer price index for the metropolitan New York-New Jersey region published by the United States Bureau of Labor Statistics. The adjustments shall be based on the difference between the average consumer price index over the twelve months preceding the calendar year of such adjustment, and either (a) the calendar year preceding the year of the last such adjustment or (b) such other calendar year as may be appropriate pursuant to any amendment to the Act.




§ 7-06 Ethical Guidelines. ::


	The Board has determined that the conduct of its members and staff should be guided by Ethical Guidelines. The Board recognizes that some of its members and staff may be subject to additional professional codes, such as the Lawyer's Code of Professional Responsibility. In addition, the standards set forth in the Act and Charter Chapters 46 and 68 are applicable to all Board members and staff. The purpose of these Guidelines is to state standards of behavior that go beyond legal and professional obligations in order to ensure the highest degree of public confidence in the work of the Board.

	   (b)   The notice of conference or hearing shall be served by first class mail or electronic means, and appropriate proof of service shall be maintained.

§ 12-12 Adjournments. ::


	   (a)    Applications for adjournments of conferences or hearings shall be governed by this section and by Rule 12-14 or Rule 12-27. Conversion of a hearing date to a conference date, or from conference to hearing, shall be deemed to be an adjournment.
	
	   (b)   Applications to adjourn conferences or hearings shall be made to the hearing officer as soon as the need for the adjournment becomes apparent. Applications for adjournments are addressed to the discretion of the hearing officer, and shall be granted only for good cause. Although consent of all parties to a request for an adjournment shall be a factor in favor of granting the request, such consent shall not by itself constitute good cause for an adjournment. Delay in seeking an adjournment shall militate against grant of the request.
	
	   (c)   If a party selects a hearing or conference date without consulting with or obtaining the consent of another party, an application for an adjournment of such date by that other party, especially if such application is based upon a scheduling conflict, shall be decided with due regard to the ex parte nature of the case scheduling.
	
	   (d)   Counsel shall file an affirmation of actual engagement prior to a ruling on an adjournment sought on that basis. Such affirmation shall state the name and nature of the conflicting matter, the court or tribunal hearing the matter, the judge before whom it is scheduled, the date that the conflicting engagement became known to counsel, and the date, time, place and approximate duration of the engagement.
	
	   (e)   Approved adjournments, other than adjournments granted on the record, shall be promptly confirmed in writing by the applicant, to all parties and to the administrative law judge.
	
	   (f)   Withdrawal of a case from the calendar by the petitioner shall not be subject to the "good cause" requirement of subdivision (b) of this section. However, such withdrawal, other than pursuant to settlement agreement or other final disposition of the case, shall be permitted only upon application to the hearing officer, who may grant or deny the application, either in full or upon stated terms and conditions.
	
	   (g)   If the administrative law judge determines that a case is not ready for hearing or conference and that an adjournment is inappropriate he or she may remove the case from the calendar. Unless otherwise directed by the administrative law judge, the case will be administratively closed if the parties do not restore the matter to the calendar within 30 days.




§ 12-13 Discovery. ::


	   (a)    Requests for production of documents, for identification of hearing witnesses, and for inspection of real evidence to be introduced at the hearing may be directed by any party to any other party without leave of the hearing officer.
	
	   (b)   Depositions shall only be taken upon motion for good cause shown. Other discovery devices, including interrogatories, shall not be permitted except upon agreement among the parties or upon motion for good cause shown. Resort to such extraordinary discovery devices shall not generally be cause for adjournment of a conference or hearing.
	
	   (c)   Discovery shall be requested and completed promptly, so that each party may reasonably prepare for the hearing. A demand for identification of witnesses, for production of documents, or for inspection of real evidence to be introduced at the hearing shall be made not less than twenty days before the hearing, or not less than twenty-five days if service of the demand is by mail. An answer to a discovery request shall be made within fifteen days of receipt of the request. An objection to a discovery request shall be made as promptly as possible, but in any event within the time for an answer to that request. Different times may be fixed by consent of the parties, or by the hearing officer for good cause. Notwithstanding the foregoing time periods, where the notice of the hearing is served less than twenty-five days in advance of the hearing, discovery shall proceed as quickly as possible, and time periods may be fixed by consent of the parties or by the hearing officer.
	
	   (d)   Any discovery dispute shall be presented to the hearing officer sufficiently in advance of the hearing to allow a timely determination. Discovery motions are addressed to the discretion of the hearing officer. The timeliness of discovery requests and responses, and of discovery-related motions, the complexity of the case, the need for the requested discovery, and the relative resources of the parties shall be among the factors in the hearing officer's exercise of discretion.
	
	   (e)   In ruling upon a discovery motion, the hearing officer may deny the motion, order compliance with a discovery request, order other discovery, or take other appropriate action. The hearing officer may grant or deny discovery upon specified conditions, including payment by one party to another of stated expenses of the discovery. Failure to comply with an order compelling discovery may result in imposition of appropriate sanctions upon the disobedient party, attorney or representative, the preclusion of witnesses or evidence, drawing of adverse inferences, or, under exceptional circumstances, removal of the case from the calendar, dismissal of the case, or declaration of default.




§ 12-14 Pre-Hearing Motions. ::


	   (a)    Pre-hearing motions shall be consolidated and addressed to the hearing officer as promptly as possible, and sufficiently in advance of the hearing to permit a timely decision to be made. Delay in presenting such a motion may, in the discretion of the hearing officer, weigh against the granting of the motion, or may lead to the granting of the motion upon appropriate conditions.
	
	   (b)   The hearing officer may in his or her discretion permit pre-hearing motions to be made in writing, by electronic means, or orally, including by telephone. The hearing officer may require the parties to submit legal briefs on any motion. Parties are encouraged to make pre-hearing motions, or to conduct preliminary discussions and scheduling of such motions, by conference telephone call or by electronic means to the hearing officer.
	
	   (c)   Motion papers shall state the grounds upon which the motion is made and the relief or order sought. Motion papers shall include notice to all other parties of their time pursuant to subdivision (d) of this section to serve papers in opposition to the motion. Motion papers and papers in opposition shall be served on all other parties, and proof of service shall be filed with the papers. The filing of motion papers or papers in opposition by a representative who has not previously appeared shall constitute the filing of a notice of appearance by that representative, and shall conform to the requirements of Rule 12-15(b).
	
	   (d)   Unless otherwise directed by the hearing officer upon application or sua sponte, the opposing party shall file and serve responsive papers no later than eight days after service of the motion papers if service of the motion papers was by personal delivery or electronic means, and no later than thirteen days after service if service of the motion papers was by mail.
	
	   (e)   Reply papers shall not be filed unless authorized by the hearing officer, and oral argument shall not be scheduled except upon the direction of the hearing officer.
	
	   (f)   Nothing in this section shall limit the applicability of other provisions to specific pre-hearing motions.




§ 12-15 Appearances at OATH. ::


	   (a)    A party may appear in person, by an attorney, or by a duly authorized representative. A person appearing for a party, including by telephone conference call, is required to file a notice of appearance with OATH. Docketing of a case by an attorney or representative of a party shall be deemed to constitute the filing of a notice of appearance by that person. The filing of any papers by an attorney or representative who has not previously appeared shall constitute the filing of a notice of appearance by that person, and shall conform to the requirements of subdivisions (b) and (d) of this Rule. Participation in a telephone conference call on behalf of a party by an attorney or representative of the party shall be deemed an appearance by the attorney or representative. Nonetheless, upon making such an appearance, the attorney or representative shall file a notice of appearance in conformity with subdivisions (b) and (d) of this section.
	
	   (b)   The appearance of a member in good standing of the bar of a court of general jurisdiction of any state or territory of the United States shall be indicated by the suffix "Esq." and the designation "attorney for (petitioner or respondent)", and the appearance of any other person shall be indicated by the designation "representative for (petitioner or respondent)".
	
	   (c)   Absent extraordinary circumstances, no application shall be made or argued by any attorney or other representative who has not filed a notice of appearance.
	
	   (d)   A person may not file a notice of appearance or appear on behalf of a party unless he or she has been retained by that party to represent the party before OATH. Filing a notice of appearance or making an appearance constitutes a representation that the person appearing has been so retained. Filing a notice of appearance constitutes a representation that the person appearing has read and is familiar with the rules of this subchapter.




§ 12-16 Ex Parte Communications. ::


	No ex parte communications, other than those related to ministerial matters regarding a conference or hearing, shall be received by a hearing officer.

Consolidation or severance may be ordered on motion or sua sponte, in furtherance of justice, efficiency or convenience.




§ 12-19 Witnesses and Documents. ::


	The parties shall have all of their witnesses available on the hearing date. A party intending to introduce documents into evidence shall bring to the hearing copies of those documents for the hearing officer, the witness, and the other parties. Repeated failure to comply with this section may be cause for sanctions. Such sanctions may include formal admonishment or reprimand, assessment of costs or imposition of a fine, exclusion of the offending person from the proceedings, exclusion or limitation of evidence, adverse evidentiary inference, adverse disposition of the case, in whole or in part, or other sanctions as the hearing officer may determine to be appropriate.




§ 12-20 Subpoenas. ::

	   (b)   A request by a party that the hearing officer issue a subpoena shall be deemed to be a motion, and shall be made in compliance with Rule 12-14 or 12-27, as appropriate; provided, however, that such a motion shall be made on 24 hours notice by electronic means or personal delivery of papers, including a copy of the proposed subpoena, unless the hearing officer directs otherwise.

The making and scheduling of requests for issuance of subpoenas by telephone conference call to the hearing officer or by electronic means is encouraged.
	
	   (c)   Subpoenas shall be served in the manner provided by § 2303 of the Civil Practice Law and Rules, unless the hearing officer directs otherwise.

§ 12-21 Order of Proceedings. ::


	Testimony and argument on the law and facts shall be presented in the following order: petitioner, witnesses called by the petitioner, if any, cross-examination, the respondent(s) and/or their counsel, witnesses called by respondent(s) and/or their counsel, cross-examination, and closing statements.

	All parties, counsel and other representatives are required to be present at the hearing and prepared to proceed at the time scheduled for commencement of the hearing. Commencement of the hearing, or of any session of the hearing, shall not be delayed beyond the scheduled starting time except for good cause as determined in the discretion of the hearing officer. Absent a finding of good cause, and to the extent permitted by the law applicable to the claims asserted in the petition, the hearing officer may direct that the hearing proceed in the absence of any missing party or representative, render a disposition of the case adverse to the missing party, or take other appropriate measures, including the imposition of appropriate sanctions. Relief from the direction of the hearing officer may be had only upon motion brought as promptly as possible pursuant to Rule 12-14 or 12-27. The hearing officer may grant or deny such a motion, in whole, in part, or upon stated conditions.




§ 12-24 Evidence at the Hearing. ::


	   (a)    Compliance with technical rules of evidence, including hearsay rules, shall not necessarily be required. Principles of civil practice and rules of evidence may be applied to ensure an orderly proceeding and a clear record, and to assist the hearing officer in the role as trier of fact. The order of proceedings may be altered by the hearing officer for convenience of the parties, attorneys, witnesses, or OATH, where substantial prejudice will not result.
	
	   (b)   The hearing officer may limit examination, the presentation of testimonial, documentary or other evidence, and the submission of rebuttal evidence.

The parties shall be given a reasonable opportunity on request to refute the officially noticed matters by evidence or by presentation of authority.
	
	   (b)   Official notice may be taken, without notice to the parties, of rules published in the Rules of the City of New York or in The City Record. In addition, all parties are deemed to have notice that official notice may be taken of other regulations, directives, guidelines, and similar documents that are lawfully applicable to the parties, provided that any such materials that are unpublished are filed with the hearing officer sufficiently before commencement of the hearing to enable all parties to address at the hearing any issue as to the applicability or meaning of any such materials.




§ 12-26 Public Access to Proceedings. ::


	   (a)    Other than conferences, all proceedings shall be open to the public, unless the hearing officer finds that a legally recognized ground exists for closure of all or a portion of the proceeding, or unless closure is required by law.

	   (b)   No person shall make or cause to be made a stenographic, electronic, audio, audio-visual or other verbatim or photographic reproduction of any hearing or other proceeding, whether such hearing or other proceeding is conducted in person, by telephone, or otherwise, except upon application to the hearing officer.

Civil Rights Law, § 52), such application shall be addressed to the discretion of the hearing officer, who may deny the application or grant it in full, in part, or upon such conditions as the hearing officer deems necessary to preserve the decorum of the proceedings and to protect the interests of the parties, witnesses and any other concerned persons.
	
	   (c)   Transcripts of proceedings made a part of the record by the administrative law judge shall be the official record of proceedings at OATH, notwithstanding the existence of any other transcript or recording, whether or not authorized under the previous subdivision of this section.




§ 12-27 Hearing Motions. ::


	Motions may be made during the hearing orally or in writing. Hearing motions made in writing shall satisfy the requirements of Rule 12-14. The hearing officer may, in his or her discretion, require that any hearing motion be briefed or otherwise supported in writing. In cases referred to a hearing officer for disposition by report and recommendation to the Board's Chair, motions addressing the sufficiency of the petition or the sufficiency of the petitioner's evidence shall be reserved until closing statements.




§ 12-28 The Transcript. ::


	Hearings shall be stenographically or electronically recorded, and the recordings shall be transcribed, unless the hearing officer directs otherwise.

§ 12-29 Decision Made on the Record. ::


	The hearing officer may conclude a case by making a decision or report and recommendation on the record.




§ 12-30 Written Comments. ::

The final determination shall notify the candidate of the commencement of the four-month period during which a special proceeding may be brought to challenge the Board's determination pursuant to Article 78 of the Civil Practice Law and Rules. If the Board affirms the hearing officer's recommended final determination in its entirety, it shall notify respondent that the hearing officer's recommended final determination was affirmed by the Board. If the Board rejects or modifies the hearing officer's recommended final determination, the Board shall provide a written determination stating the basis for any assessed penalty or public funds determination, including any findings of fact and conclusions of law.

	      (1)   For printed material, the words “Paid for by” must appear, followed by (i) the name of the independent spender; (ii) if the spender is an entity: (A) the name of any individual or entity that owns or controls more than 50% of the independent spender, (B) the name of the independent spender’s chief executive officer or equivalent, if any, and (C) the independent spender’s top donors as described in subdivision (b) of this section; and (iii) the words “Not authorized by any candidate or candidate committee.

	      (2)   For television, internet videos, or other types of video communications, the words "Paid for by" followed by the name of the independent spender must be clearly spoken at the beginning or end of the communication in a pitch and tone substantially similar to the rest of the communication. Additionally, simultaneous with the spoken disclosure, in a conspicuous size and style and enclosed in a box, the words "Paid for by" must appear followed by: (i) the name of the independent spender; (ii) if the spender is an entity, the spender's top donors as described in subdivision (b) of this section; and (iii) the words "Not authorized by any candidate or candidate committee.

For radio and internet audio communications of 30 seconds in duration or shorter, subparagraph (ii) of this paragraph may be omitted.
	
	      (4)   For non-automated telephone calls lasting longer than ten seconds, the words "This call is paid for by" followed by the name of the independent spender and the words "Not authorized by any candidate or candidate committee. More information is available at nyc.gov/FollowTheMoney" must be clearly spoken during the call in a pitch and tone substantially similar to the rest of the call.
	
	   (b)   Identification of an independent spender's top donors in a communication shall be as follows:
	
	      (1)   A spender's top donors are its largest aggregate contributors during the 12 months preceding the election, in descending order by aggregate amount, who have contributed at least $5,000.
	
	      (2)   If there are at least three such donors:
	
	         (i)   Printed identification shall be the words "Top Three Donors" followed by the names of such donors;
	
	         (ii)   Video identification shall be the words "The top three donors to the organization responsible for this advertisement are" followed by the names of such donors;
	
	         (iii)   Audio identification shall be the words "with funding provided by" followed by the names of such donors;
	
	         (iv)   If the third largest donor has donated the same amount as the fourth largest donor, the independent spender may choose which three donors to include, so long as no donor is included that has donated less than any other donor that is not included.
	
	      (3)   If there are only two such donors, the words "Top Donors" must replace "Top Three Donors."

	   (d)   The requirements of this section may be modified by the Board concerning items upon which disclosures cannot be reasonably printed, pursuant to § 1052(a)(15)(c)(i) of the Charter or any other items whose disclosures are not otherwise provided for in § 1052(a)(15)(c) of the Charter.
	
	   (e)   This section shall not apply to communications required to include a disclosure pursuant to § 3-703(16) of the Code.
	
	




§ 13-05 Non-Independent Expenditures. ::


	An expenditure by an individual or entity referring to a candidate, that was authorized, requested, suggested, fostered by, or cooperated in by such candidate or the opponent of such candidate, or their agents, is not an independent expenditure and is not governed by this chapter. Factors used by the Board to determine whether an expenditure is independent or non-independent are referenced in Rule 1-08(f).




§ 13-06 Guidance for Independent Spenders. ::


	Prior to dissemination of a communication, an individual or entity may seek guidance regarding whether the communication would be subject to the rules of this chapter by submitting a written request in the form and manner prescribed by the Board, including a description or sample of the proposed communication and a description of its proposed dissemination. If the request is received more than 14 days before the election, guidance shall be provided within seven days, and if such request is received during the 14 days prior to the election, guidance shall be provided within 24 hours. Such guidance applies only to the communication exactly as submitted and disseminated exactly as described, and constitutes neither approval nor disapproval of the content, appropriateness, or accuracy of the communication.




§ 13-07 Document Retention. ::


	Independent spenders must maintain for three years after the date of the election to which they apply: (1) records that enable the Board to verify the accuracy of disclosure statements, including bills for goods or services used to produce and disseminate a communication, as well as records of all contributions received by independent spenders that are entities; and (2) copies of all advertisements, pamphlets, circulars, flyers, brochures, and other printed communications disseminated, and a schedule of all radio or television time purchased, and scripts used therein or the audio or video source files. Documents previously provided to and received by the Board do not need to be maintained by the independent spender.




§ 13-08 Complaints and Investigations; Board Determinations. ::


	   (a)   The following procedures shall apply for complaints and investigations regarding potential violations of Charter § 1052(a)(15):
	
	      (1)   Initiation of proceeding. A proceeding pursuant to Charter § 1052(a)(15)(e) may be commenced when: (1) the Board receives a written complaint sworn to or affirmed, alleging the commission or omission of acts in violation of the Charter or this chapter, or (2) the Board, on its own initiative, undertakes an investigation of a possible violation of the Charter or this chapter.
	
	      (2)   Service of complaints. A complaint shall be filed by mailing it to, or by personally serving it on, the New York City Campaign Finance Board.
	
	      (3)   Contents of complaint. A complaint shall specify times, places, and names of witnesses to the acts charged as violations of the Charter or this chapter to the extent known. A complaint shall be based on personal knowledge, if possible. If a complaint is based on information and belief, the complainant shall state the source of that information and belief. Copies of all documentary evidence available to the complainant shall be attached to the complaint.
	
	      (4)   Initial complaint processing. Upon receipt of a complaint, the Board will review the complaint for substantial compliance with the requirements of paragraph (3), and if the complaint complies with those requirements, the Board shall within 10 days after receipt mail to each respondent notification that the complaint has been filed, and enclose a copy of the complaint. If a complaint does not comply with the requirements of paragraph (3), or the Board deems it to be facially lacking in merit, the Board shall dismiss the complaint and shall so notify the complainant.
	
	      (5)   Opportunity to respond to complaint. Within 20 days from mailing by the Board of a copy of the complaint to a respondent, or within such lesser time as may be specified by the Board for complaints received less than 40 days before the election, the respondent may submit an answer sworn to or affirmed, which may set forth reasons why the Board should dismiss the complaint. If, based upon its review of the complaint and any answer filed, the Board determines the complaint to be lacking in merit, the Board shall dismiss the complaint.
	
	      (6)   Investigation. Following receipt of a complaint, or at any time, if acting on its own initiative, the Board may conduct an investigation into possible violations of the Charter or this chapter. In its investigation, the Board may use its investigative powers pursuant to Charter § 1052(a)(5). An investigation may include, but is not limited to, field investigations, desk and field audits, the issuance of subpoenas, the taking of sworn testimony, the issuance of document requests and interrogatories, and other methods of information gathering.
	
	   (b)   The following procedures shall apply to determinations regarding potential violations of Charter § 1052(a)(15):
	
	      (1)   Determination that complaint lacks merit. Following an investigation, the Board may determine that a complaint is lacking in merit or that violations of the Charter and this chapter have not been substantiated and dismiss the complaint or terminate the investigation.
	
	      (2)   Notice and opportunity to contest.
	
	         (i)   If the Board has reason to believe that a violation of Charter § 1052(a)(15) or this chapter has occurred, the Board shall notify the individual or entity in writing of the alleged violation and proposed civil penalty. Such notice shall:
	
	            (A)   Set forth in detail the legal basis for the Board's reason to believe there is a violation of Charter § 1052(a)(15) or this chapter;
	
	            (B)   Notify the individual or entity of the opportunity to submit information and documentation for the Board's consideration within a reasonable time period to be specified in such notice;
	
	            (C)   If sent prior to the election, notify the individual or entity of the opportunity to appear before the Board or its designee at a hearing to contest the alleged violation and proposed civil penalty; and
	
	            (D)   If sent after the election, notify the individual or entity of the opportunity to appear before the Board or its designee at a hearing, or to appear before a hearing officer, to contest the alleged violation and proposed civil penalty. Adjudications conducted after an election shall meet the requirements set forth in Charter § 1046 unless such procedures are waived by the individual or entity.
	
	         (ii)   Unless the individual or entity is specifically notified to the contrary by the Board, the opportunity to submit information and documentation described in the notice shall be the only such opportunity, and any information and documentation that is not timely received by the Board may, at the Board's sole discretion, be disregarded.
	
	         (iii)   Following this opportunity to submit information and documentation, consideration of any information and documentation submitted, and consideration of any appearance before the Board or its designee, the Board may determine the amount of civil penalties for any violations it determines to have occurred, and shall provide notice setting forth in detail the legal basis of the Board's determination. If these amounts, as determined by the Board, are not paid by the payment deadline set forth in the notice, they may be sought through appropriate enforcement action.
