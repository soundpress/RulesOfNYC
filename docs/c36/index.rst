*§ 1-01 Valuable Gifts.* ::


(a)  For the purposes of Charter § 2604(b)(5), a "valuable gift" means any gift to a public servant which has a value of $50.00 or more, whether in the form of money, service, loan, travel, entertainment, hospitality, thing or promise, or in any other form. Two or more gifts to a public servant shall be deemed to be a single gift for purposes of this subdivision and Charter § 2604(b)(5) if they are given to the public servant within a twelve-month period under one or more of the following circumstances: (1) they are given by the same person; and/or (2) they are given by persons who the public servant knows or should know are (i) relatives or domestic partners of one another; or (ii) are directors, trustees, or employees of the same firm or affiliated firms.

(b) As used in subdivision (a) of this section, (1) "relative" shall mean a spouse, child, grandchild, parent, sibling, and grandparent; a parent, domestic partner, child, or sibling of a spouse or domestic partner; and a spouse or domestic partner of a parent, child, or sibling; (2) firms are "affiliated" if one is a subsidiary of the other or if they have a parent firm in common or if they have a stockholder in common that owns at least 25 percent of the shares of each firm; (3) "firm," "spouse," and "ownership interest" shall have the meaning ascribed to those terms in § 2601 of the Charter; (4) "domestic partner" means a domestic partner as defined in New York City Administrative Code § 1-112(21).

(c) For the purposes of Charter § 2604(b)(5), a public servant may accept gifts that are customary on family or social occasions from a family member or close personal friend who the public servant knows is or intends to become engaged in business dealings with the City, when:

   (1) it can be shown under all relevant circumstances that it is the family or personal relationship rather than the business dealings that is the controlling factor; and

   (2) the public servant's receipt of the gift would not result in or create the appearance of:

      (i) using his or her office for private gain;

      (ii) giving preferential treatment to any person or entity;

      (iii) losing independence or impartiality; or

      (iv) accepting gifts or favors for performing official duties.

(d) For the purposes of Charter § 2604(b)(5), a public servant may accept awards, plaques and other similar items which are publicly presented in recognition of public service, provided that the item or items have no substantial resale value.

(e) For the purposes of Charter § 2604(b)(5), a public servant may accept free meals or refreshments in the course of and for the purpose of conducting City business under the following circumstances:

   (1) when offered during a meeting which the public servant is attending for official reasons;

   (2) when offered at a company cafeteria, club or other setting where there is no public price structure and individual payment is impractical;

   (3) when a meeting the public servant is attending for official reasons begins in a business setting but continues through normal meal hours in a restaurant, and a refusal to participate and/or individual payment would be impractical;

   (4) when the free meals or refreshments are provided by the host entity at a meeting held at an out-of-the-way location, alternative facilities are not available and individual payment would be impractical; and

   (5) when the public servant would not have otherwise purchased food and refreshments had he or she not been placed in such a situation while representing the interests of the City.

(f) For the purposes of Charter § 2604(b)(5), a public servant may:

   (1) accept meals or refreshments when participating as a panelist or speaker in a professional or educational program and the meals or refreshments are provided to all panelists;

   (2) be present at a professional or educational program as a guest of the sponsoring organization;

   (3) be a guest at ceremonies or functions sponsored or encouraged by the City as a matter of City policy, such as, for example, those involving housing, education, legislation or government administration;

   (4) attend a public affair of an organization composed of representatives of business, labor, professions, news media or organizations of a civic, charitable or community nature, when invited by the sponsoring organization, provided that this exception does not apply when the invitation is from an organization which has business dealings, as defined in Charter § 2601(8), with, or a matter before, the public servant's agency;

   (5) be a guest at any function or occasion where the attendance of the public servant has been approved in writing as in the interests of the City, in advance where practicable or within a reasonable time thereafter, by the employee's agency head or by a deputy mayor if the public servant is an agency head.

(g) For the purposes of Charter § 2604(b)(5), a public servant who is an elected official or a member of the elected official's staff authorized by the elected official may attend a function given by an organization composed of representatives of business, labor, professions, news media or organizations of a civic, charitable or community nature, when invited by the sponsoring organization. For the purpose of this subdivision, the authorizing elected official for the central staff of the council is the speaker of the council.

(h) (1)  For the purposes of Charter § 2604(b)(5), a public servant's acceptance of travel-related expenses from a private entity can be considered a gift to the City rather than to the public servant, when:

(i) the trip is for a City purpose and therefore could properly be paid for with City funds;

      (ii) the travel arrangements are appropriate to that purpose; and

      (iii) the trip is no longer than reasonably necessary to accomplish the business which is its purpose.

   (2) To avoid an appearance of impropriety, it is recommended that for public servants who are not elected officials, each such trip and the acceptance of payment therefor be approved in advance and in writing by the head of the appropriate agency, or if the public servant is an agency head, by a deputy mayor.

      (i) A public servant should not accept a "valuable gift," as defined herein, from any person or entity engaged in business dealings with the City. If the public servant receives such valuable gift, he or she should return the gift to the donor. If that is not practical, the public servant should report the receipt of a valuable gift to the inspector general of the public servant's agency, who shall determine the appropriate disposition of the gift. Nothing in this section shall be deemed to authorize a public servant to act in violation of any applicable laws, including the criminal law, City agency rules, or Mayoral Executive Orders (including, but not limited to, Executive Order No. 16 of 1978 (as amended)), which may impose additional requirements to report gifts and offers of gifts to the agency's inspector general, whether or not a gift is accepted or returned.

(j) City agencies are encouraged to establish rules concerning gifts for their own employees which may not be less restrictive than as set forth in Charter § 2604(b)(5) as interpreted by this section.

(k) (1)  Nothing in this section shall be deemed to authorize a public servant to accept a gift of any value in violation of any other applicable federal, state or local law, rule or regulation, including but not limited to the New York State Penal Law.

   (2) The provisions of this section shall be read in conjunction with the provisions of Charter § 2604(b)(2) and 53 RCNY § 1-13 (prohibiting certain conduct that conflicts with the proper discharge of a public servant's official duties); § 2604(b)(3) of the Charter (prohibiting the use or attempted use of one's City position for private gain); and § 2604(b)(13) of the Charter (prohibiting receipt by public servants of compensation except from the City for performing any official duty and prohibiting receipt of gratuities).






*§ 1-02 Public Servants Charged with Substantial Policy Discretion.* ::


(a)  For purposes of Charter § 2604(b)(12) and § 2604(b)(15), a public servant is deemed to have substantial policy discretion if he or she has major responsibilities and exercises independent judgment in connection with determining important agency matters. Public servants with substantial policy discretion include, but are not limited to: agency heads, deputy agency heads, assistant agency heads, members of boards and commissions, and public servants in charge of any major office, division, bureau or unit of an agency. Agency heads shall:

   (1) designate by title, or position, and name the public servants in their agencies who have substantial policy discretion as defined by this section;

   (2) file annually with the Conflicts of Interest Board, no later than February 28 of each year, a list of such titles or positions and the names of the public servants holding them; and

   (3) notify these public servants in writing of the restrictions set forth in Charter § 2604(b)(12) and § 2604(b)(15) to which they are subject. If the Conflicts of Interest Board determines that the title, position, or name of any public servant should be added to or deleted from the list supplied by an agency, the Board shall notify the head of the agency involved of that addition or deletion; the agency shall in turn promptly notify the affected public servant of the change.

*§ 1-17 Procedures to Appeal a Designation as a Required Filer of a Financial Disclosure Report.* ::


(a) Applicability. Any employee designated as a required filer by his or her agency may appeal the determination that he or she is required to file a financial disclosure report with the Conflicts of Interest Board ("the Board") pursuant to New York City Administrative Code § 12-110, first to his or her agency head and then to the Board.

(b) Appeal to the Agency Head.

   (1) Any employee seeking to appeal the determination that he or she is required to file a financial disclosure report shall complete a "Notice of Appeal to Agency Head," on such form as the Board shall adopt and make available on the Board's website. The completed form shall include the employee's name, employee identification number ("EIN") or agency identifier, agency name, agency code, civil service title, office title, and a brief statement of the grounds for the appeal.

   (2) An employee seeking to appeal such agency determination shall file, in the manner designated by the agency, the completed Notice of Appeal form with his or her agency financial disclosure liaison prior to the deadline for filing his or her financial disclosure report but in any event the employee shall have no fewer than twenty-one days within which to file such Notice of Appeal after receiving the notification by the agency that he or she must file a financial disclosure report. Failure to file the Notice of Appeal by the later of twenty-one days after such notification or the deadline for filing, as the case may be, shall constitute a waiver of the right to appeal and the employee will be required to file a financial disclosure report.

   (3) Upon receipt of the completed Notice of Appeal, the agency financial disclosure liaison shall:

      (i) Time and date stamp the Notice of Appeal form;

      (ii) Provide the employee with a copy of such time and date-stamped form as a receipt;

      (iii) Transmit the Notice of Appeal form forthwith to the agency head or his or her designee; and

      (iv) Within five days of the receipt of the Notice of Appeal, notify the Board by e-mail of the pendency of the appeal and the date that the appeal was received by the agency. Such notice to the Board shall contain the employee's name, agency, EIN (or agency identifier), and the date that the appeal was filed.

   (4) No later than fourteen days after filing the Notice of Appeal, the employee shall submit to his or her agency head or such agency head's designee a written statement and any documentation in support thereof setting forth the reasons that such employee believes he or she should not be designated as a required filer of a financial disclosure report. Failure to submit such written statement within such fourteen-day period shall constitute a waiver of the right to appeal.

   (5) Within fourteen days of the agency's receipt of the employee's written statement, the agency head or his or her designee shall advise in writing or by email the employee, his or her employee's collective bargaining representative, attorney or other representative, if any, and the Board of the agency's decision as to whether or not the employee is required to file. If the agency head or the agency head's designee fails to meet such fourteen-day deadline, the appeal shall be deemed granted upon default.

   (6) A decision of the agency head or his or her designee that denies an appeal shall set forth the reasons for and evidence relied upon in reaching such decision. Such denial shall be predicated on a showing that the employee meets the requirements of at least one of the filing categories set forth in New York City Administrative Code § 12-110(b)(3)(a)(3)-(4) and 53 RCNY §§ 1-02, 1-14, and 1-15. If the agency denies the appeal, the notice to the Board shall state the manner by which the employee was notified and the date of such notification.

   (7) The agency head or his or her designee may consult with the Board prior to rendering its decision.

(c) Procedure Upon Agency's Grant of Appeal. If the agency grants the employee's appeal, the employee's name shall be removed from the Board's list of required filers and the employee will not be required to file a financial disclosure report for that filing year or in future years until or unless the employee's title, position, duties, or responsibilities change in such a way that he or she would be required to file pursuant to the criteria set forth in New York City Administrative Code § 12-110(b).

(d) Procedure Upon Agency's Denial of Appeal.

   (1) An employee whose appeal is denied by his or her agency shall, within thirty days after service of the agency's notice of denial, either:

      (i) file a completed financial disclosure report with the Board, or

      (ii) file with the Board and with the employee's agency head or his or her designee a completed "Notice of Appeal to Board," on such form as the Board shall prescribe and make available on the Board's website. Failure to file either a financial disclosure report or an appeal with the Board within the thirty-day period shall constitute a waiver of the right to a further appeal and shall subject the employee to the imposition of the statutory late filing fine pursuant to Administrative Code § 12-110(g).

   (2) Within thirty days after filing of a Notice of Appeal to the Board, the employee shall file with the Board and file with the employee's agency head or his or her designee the following materials:

      (i) A copy of the statement and any supporting materials previously submitted to the agency head by the employee on the appeal in accordance with paragraph one of subdivision (a) of this section;

      (ii) A copy of the agency head's decision on such appeal; and

      (iii) Any supplemental documents the employee elects to provide.

   (3) Within thirty days after the employee files the materials set forth in paragraph two of this subdivision, the agency shall file with the Board all materials relied upon by the agency in making its determination that the employee is required to file a financial disclosure report, as well as any additional documents in support of the agency's determination.

   (4) Within thirty days after the agency has filed the materials set forth in paragraph three of this subdivision, the employee may file with the Board such additional materials as he or she deems necessary to either rebut evidence produced by the agency or otherwise support his or her position.

   (5) The Board's Director of Financial Disclosure shall review the agency's determination and the documents submitted by the employee and the agency and shall make a recommendation to the Board, or to the Executive Director upon delegation by the Board, as to whether the agency's determination should be upheld or reversed. The agency and employee shall each be served with a copy of the recommendation of the Director of Financial Disclosure and, within thirty days of service of the recommendation, may submit written comments to the Board or Executive Director, as the case may be, upon the proposed recommendation.

   (6) In the event that the Board, in its sole discretion, determines that issues are presented by the written materials filed on the appeal that require an evidentiary hearing, the Board may order such a hearing before the full Board, or, in the discretion of the Chair, before a member or members of the Board or before the Executive Director, designated for that purpose, at which the employee and agency may call witnesses to testify under oath to determine any such issue. If the Board requests additional information, both the employee and the agency shall provide to the Board whatever additional information it requests, within fourteen days after service of such a request in writing or by email by the Board. Failure of either party to timely provide any of the requested information may result in a summary finding adverse to that party.

   (7) The Board or the Executive Director, as the case may be, shall review the recommendation and any comments submitted in response thereto and issue a decision and order either upholding or reversing the agency's decision.

   (8) If the Board grants the appeal, the employee's name shall be removed from the Board's list of required filers and the employee will not be required to file a financial disclosure report for that filing year or in future years until or unless the employee's title, position, duties, or responsibilities change such that he or she would be required to file pursuant to the criteria set forth in New York City Administrative Code § 12-110(b).

   (9) If the appeal is denied, the employee shall either:

      (i) file a financial disclosure report for that filing year within thirty days after service of the denial of the appeal by the Board, and shall file for future years until or unless the employee's title, position, duties, or responsibilities change such that he or she would not be required to file pursuant to the criteria set forth in Administrative Code § 12-110(b); or

      (ii) commence, within the time provided by law, an Article 78 proceeding to review the Board's decision.

(e) General Provisions.

   (1) At all stages of the financial disclosure appeals process, the employee may be represented by a union representative, an attorney or other representative.

   (2) Once an employee files an appeal with the Board, neither the employee nor the agency or their respective representatives may communicate ex parte with any member of the Board staff or Board with respect to the matter, except on consent of the opposing party or in an emergency.

   (3) During the pendency of the appeal and any court proceeding timely brought by the employee to review a denial of the appeal by the Board, the employee need not file a financial disclosure report, and no late filing fines will be assessed for that period.

   (4) Whenever a deadline in the process set forth in this section is measured from the filing or service of notice and notice is filed or served by United States Postal Service mail, five days shall be added to the deadline.

   (5) The Board may, in its discretion and for good cause shown, extend any deadline set forth in this rule. An application for such extension must be made in writing and prior to the expiration of the deadline.

   (6) In the case of any appeal that is decided upon default, whether in favor of the employee or the agency, that decision shall apply to that filing year only and shall not be a determination on the merits.

   (7) Unless otherwise stated, any reference to a number of days specified as a period within which an act is required to be done means such number of calendar days.

   (8) Nothing in this rule shall prevent the Board from determining, pursuant to New York City Administrative Code § 12-110(b)(3)(a)(2)-(3), that any public servant, regardless of an agency's determination, is required to file a financial disclosure report.

(b) Response to the Notice of Initial Determination of Probable Cause.

   (1) For the purposes of Charter § 2603(h)(1), the respondent has twenty (20) days from the date of service to submit a written response to the Notice of Initial Determination of Probable Cause ("Notice") or request an extension. The response is an opportunity to explain, rebut, or provide information concerning the factual or legal allegations in the Notice.

   (4) After receiving the full payment of any monetary penalty to be paid to the Board, the enforcement attorney will present the proposed settlement agreement to the Board for its review and approval.

      (i) If the Board approves the proposed settlement agreement, the settlement agreement will be signed by the Board Chair.

For purposes of Administrative Code § 3-904(c), a non-profit entity may apply to the Board for a formal determination that an elected official or an agent of an elected official does not exercise control over the entity. Such an application must be in writing, signed by an agent of the not-for-profit entity, and provide a detailed explanation of the underlying facts that show why, consistent with the considerations included in the definition of “organization affiliated with an elected official” set forth in Administrative Code § 3-901 and 53 RCNY § 3-03, the entity should not be considered an “organization affiliated with an elected official.”








*§ 3-03. Factors by which the Board Will Determine Whether an Entity is Affiliated with an Elected Official.* ::


For purposes of Administrative Code § 3-901, in determining whether a person holding office as Mayor, Comptroller, Public Advocate, Borough President or member of the Council, or an agent or appointee of such a person, exercises control over a non-profit entity, the Board will consider the totality of the circumstances by weighing each of the following individual factors:

(a) whether the organization was created by a person currently holding office as Mayor, Comptroller, Public Advocate, Borough President, or member of the Council, or an agent of such official, or by an individual who was previously employed by, or was a paid political consultant of, the elected official, and, if so, how recently such organization was created;

(b) whether the board of the organization is chaired by such an elected official or the official’s agent;

(c) whether board members are appointed by such an elected official or the official’s agent or only upon nomination of other individuals or entities that are not agents of such elected official;

(d) whether board members serve for fixed terms or can be removed without cause by an elected official or the official’s agent;

(e) the degree of involvement or direction by such an elected official or the official’s agent in such organization’s policies, operations, and activities;

(f) the degree to which public servants, acting under the authority or direction of the elected official or an agent of the elected official, perform duties on behalf of the organization as part of their official City employment;

(g) whether the purpose of the organization advances either the mission of a City agency under the control of the elected official or the political or policy interests of the elected official; and

(h) whether more than one elected official serves on the board of the organization.








*§ 3-04. Annual Reporting by Organizations Affiliated with an Elected Official.* ::


Pursuant to Administrative Code § 3-902, all organizations affiliated with an elected official must submit the reporting required pursuant to Administrative Code § 3-902(a) on the Board’s website, no later than August 1 for the previous calendar year, as follows.

(a) Reporting Requirements for Restricted Organizations.

   (1) A restricted organization must submit the information listed in Administrative Code §§ 3-902(a)(1) to 3-902(a)(8).

   (2) To comply with the reporting requirement of Administrative Code §§ 3-902(a)(6) and 3-902(a)(7), a restricted organization must report for each donation received during the previous calendar year:

      (i) the name of any donor who, as of the date of such donation, was either listed in the City’s Doing Business Database or who was a household member of a person listed in the City’s Doing Business Database;

      (ii) the name of any donor who was added to the City’s Doing Business Database within 180 days after the receipt of such donation or who was a household member of a person added to the City’s Doing Business Database within 180 days after the receipt of such donation;

      (iii) if the donor was the household member of a person listed in the City’s Doing Business Database as of the date of such donation, or added to the City’s Doing Business Database within 180 days after the receipt of such donation, the name of the person listed in the City’s Doing Business Database;

      (iv) the name of any donor who made a donation with a reasonable value of $1,000 or more;

      (v) the City and State of residence of the donor;

      (vi) the date of each donation;

      (vii) the value of each donation;

      (viii) the value of any excess donation refunded pursuant to Administrative Code §§ 3-903(a) or 3-903(b); and

      (ix) the date of any excess donation refunded pursuant to Administrative Code §§ 3-903(a) or 3-903(b).

   (3) Multiple donations made by a person listed in the City’s Doing Business Database and that person’s household members in the same calendar year are considered in the aggregate for purposes of Administrative Code §§ 3-903(a), and 3-903(b). Multiple donations made by an individual in the same calendar year are considered in the aggregate for purposes of Administrative Code § 3-902(a)(7) and for purposes of obtaining the individual donor’s written submission pursuant to Administrative Code § 3-903(d).

   (4) In determining whether and when a donation must be returned pursuant to Administrative Code § 3-903(b), where a person is added to the City’s Doing Business Database in a calendar year and the donor or household members of the donor make multiple donations to the organization that in the aggregate exceed $400 in that calendar year, the date of receipt will be deemed to be the date that the aggregate donations for the calendar year among the donor and household members of the donor exceed $400.

   (5) To determine whether a donation may be accepted pursuant to Administrative Code §§ 3-903(a) and (b), and to comply with the reporting requirement of Administrative Code § 3-902(a)(6), a restricted organization must take the following steps to determine whether a donor was listed in the City’s Doing Business Database or was a household member of a person listed in the City’s Doing Business Database, either on the date of the donation or as of 180 days after the date of the donation:

      (i) check the name of the donor against the City’s Doing Business Database both at the time of the donation and as of 180 days after the date of the donation;

      (ii) consult the organization’s records, including but not limited to donors’ written submissions collected pursuant to Administrative Code § 3-903(d), if any, to determine whether the donor was a household member of a person listed in the City’s Doing Business Database;

      (iii) consult each of the following people: (a) the organization’s affiliated elected official or the agent of the organization’s affiliated elected official who exercises control over the organization; (b) each board member of the organization; and (c) each principal officer of the organization. The organization must request that each person consulted pursuant to this subparagraph review a list of the organization’s most recent donors and inform the organization if such person believes that a donor is the household member of a person listed in the Doing Business Database. The organization must obtain the names of the spouse or domestic partner of any such donor (or, if the donor is an unemancipated child, his or her parent) and check those names against the Doing Business Database; and

      (iv) if an organization believes that a donor, a donor’s spouse or domestic partner (or, if a donor is an unemancipated child, his or her parent), is not a person with business dealings with the City, despite such person’s name matching the name of an individual in the Doing Business Database, the organization must submit information supporting that conclusion to the Board. The Board will review the submission and determine whether the donation may be accepted pursuant to Administrative Code §§ 3-903(a) or 3-903(b) and if it must be reported pursuant to Administrative Code § 3-902(a)(6).

   (6) To comply with the reporting requirement of Administrative Code § 3-902(a)(8), a restricted organization must submit to the Board a list of each elected official communication created or distributed, which list must include a description, the date, and the total cost of each such communication. In calculating the total cost of an elected official communication, a restricted organization must include the value of all goods and services paid by the organization to create and distribute the elected official communication, including without limitation the value of the time of its employees and the value of all goods and services donated by a non-governmental source for the communication’s creation or distribution.

(b) Reporting Requirements for Unrestricted Organizations.

   (1) An unrestricted organization must submit the information listed in Administrative Code §§ 3-902(a)(1) to (a)(9).

   (2) To comply with the reporting requirement of Administrative Code § 3-902(a)(6), an unrestricted organization must take the following steps to determine whether a donor was listed in the City’s Doing Business Database or was a household member of a person listed in the City’s Doing Business Database, either on the date of the donation or within 180 days after the date of the donation:

      (i) check the name of the donor against the City’s Doing Business Database both at the time of the donation and as of 180 days after the date of the donation;

      (ii) consult the organization’s records, including but not limited to donors’ written submissions collected pursuant to Administrative Code § 3-903(d), to determine whether the donor was a household member of a person listed in the City’s Doing Business Database; and

      (iii) if an organization believes that a donor, a donor’s spouse or domestic partner (or, if a donor is an unemancipated child, his or her parent), is not a person with business dealings with the City, despite such person’s name matching the name of an individual in the Doing Business Database, the organization must submit information supporting that conclusion to the Board. The Board will review the submission and determine whether the donation must be reported pursuant to Administrative Code § 3-902(a)(6).

   (3) To comply with the reporting requirement of Administrative Code § 3-902(a)(7), an unrestricted organization must submit to the Board the names of any individuals who or entities that made a donation with a reasonable value of $1,000 or more, whether in a single donation or in multiple donations. If an unrestricted organization receives multiple donations from the same individual or entity, the aggregate value of which has a reasonable value of $1,000 or more, the organization must report the date and value of every donation from that individual or entity.

   (4) To comply with the reporting requirement of Administrative Code § 3-902(a)(8), an unrestricted organization must submit to the Board a list of each elected official communication created or distributed, which list must include a description, the date, and the total cost of each such communication. In calculating the total cost of an elected official communication, an unrestricted organization must include the value of all goods and services paid by the organization to create and distribute the elected official communication, including without limitation the value of the time of its employees and the value of all goods and services donated by a non-governmental source for the communication’s creation or distribution.

   (5) To comply with the reporting requirement of Administrative Code § 3-902(a)(9), an unrestricted organization must report its total expenditures for the previous calendar year and, for the current calendar year, both total budgeted expenditures and budgeted expenditures for elected official communications.

(c) Privacy, Safety, and Security Requests.

   (1) Pursuant to Administrative Code § 3-902(b), an organization affiliated with an elected official may submit a request to the Board that disclosure of one or more of its donors and/or the amount of donation not be made public. The organization must make such a request in writing no later than April 1 for the previous calendar year and must explain why the release of such information to the public may cause harm, threats, harassment, or reprisals to the donor, or to individuals or property affiliated with the donor.

   (2) Whether or not a reporting entity has submitted a request pursuant to this subdivision, the Board may upon its own initiative grant privacy as to any information submitted by an organization affiliated with an elected official, upon a finding by the Board that the release of such information would constitute a risk to the safety or security of any person.
