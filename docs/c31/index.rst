*§ 1-02 Jurisdiction.* ::


Pursuant to Charter § 1049(3), OATH's jurisdiction includes the authority to render any ruling or order necessary and appropriate under applicable law or agency rule for the just and efficient adjudication of cases.






*§ 1-03 Applicability.* ::


This chapter applies to the conduct of all cases, including trials, pre-trial and post-trial matters, except to the extent that this chapter may be superseded by CAPA or other provision of law.








*§ 1-04 Construction and Waiver.* ::


This title will be liberally construed to promote just and efficient adjudication of cases. This title may be waived or modified on such terms and conditions as may be determined in a particular case to be appropriate by an administrative law judge.








*§ 1-05 Effective Date.* ::


This chapter is effective on the first day permitted by CAPA, § 1043(e), and applies to all cases brought before the OATH Trials Division. However, for cases initiated prior to the effective date of these rules, no act which was valid, timely or otherwise proper under the rules applicable at the time of the act will be rendered improper by the subsequent effectiveness of this chapter.








*§ 1-06 Computation of Time.* ::


Periods of days prescribed in this chapter will be calculated in calendar days, except that when a period of days expires on a Saturday, Sunday or legal holiday, the period will run until the next business day. Where this chapter prescribes different time periods for taking an action depending whether service of papers is personal or by mail, service of papers by electronic means will be deemed to be personal service, solely for purposes of calculating the applicable period of time.








*§ 1-07 Filing of Papers.* ::


(a) Generally. Papers may be filed at OATH in person, by mail or by electronic means.

(b) Headings. The subject matter heading for each paper sent by personal service, mail or electronic means must indicate the OATH index number where one has been assigned pursuant to 48 RCNY § 1-26(b).

(c) Means of service on adversary. Submission of papers by a party in a case to the administrative law judge by electronic means, mail or personal delivery without providing equivalent method of service to all other parties will be deemed to be an ex parte communication.

(d) Proof of service. Proof of service must be maintained by the parties for all papers filed at OATH. Proof of service must be in the form of an affidavit by the person effecting service, or in the form of a signed acknowledgement of receipt of papers by the person receiving the papers. A writing admitting service by the person to be served is adequate proof of service. Proof of service for papers served by electronic means, in addition to the foregoing, may also be in the form of a record confirming delivery or acknowledging receipt of the electronic transmission.








*§ 1-08 Access to Facilities and Programs by People with Disabilities.* ::


OATH is committed to providing equal access to its facilities and programs to people with disabilities and OATH will make reasonable accommodations requested by people with disabilities. A person requesting an accommodation for purposes of participation in a case at OATH, including attendance as a member of the public, must request such accommodation sufficiently in advance of the proceeding in which the person wishes to participate to permit a reasonable time to evaluate the request. A request for accommodation must be submitted to OATH's Calendar Unit.









**Subchapter B: Rules of Conduct**



*§ 1-11 Appearances.* ::


(a) A party may appear in person, by an attorney, or by a duly authorized representative. A person appearing for a party, including by telephone conference call, is required to file a notice of appearance with OATH. Docketing of a case by an attorney or representative of a party will be deemed to constitute the filing of a notice of appearance by that person. The filing of any papers by an attorney or representative who has not previously appeared will constitute the filing of a notice of appearance by that person, and must conform to the requirements of subdivisions (b), (d) and (e) of this section.

(b) The appearance of a member in good standing of the bar of a court of general jurisdiction of any state or territory of the United States must be indicated by the suffix "Esq." and the designation "attorney for (petitioner or respondent)", and the appearance of any other person must be indicated by the designation "representative for (petitioner or respondent)".

(c) Absent extraordinary circumstances, no application may be made or argued by any attorney or other representative who has not filed a notice of appearance. Any application submitted on behalf of a party or participation in a conference, whether by e-mail, letter or phone, will be deemed an appearance by the attorney or representative. After making such an appearance, the attorney or representative must file a notice of appearance in conformity with subdivisions (b) , (d) and (e) of this section.

(d) A person may not file a notice of appearance on behalf of a party unless he or she has been retained by that party to represent the party before OATH. Filing a notice of appearance constitutes a representation that the person appearing has been so retained. Filing a notice of appearance pursuant to subdivision (a) of this section constitutes a representation that the person appearing has read and is familiar with the rules of this subchapter.

(e) Each attorney or representative appearing before OATH must provide his or her address, telephone number, fax number, and an e-mail address on all notices of appearance and must provide prompt written notice of any change in name, address, telephone number, fax number, or e-mail address.








*§ 1-12 Withdrawal and Substitution of Counsel.* ::


(a) An attorney who has filed a notice of appearance must not withdraw from representation without the permission of the administrative law judge, on application. Withdrawals will not be granted unless upon consent of the client or when other cause exists as delineated in the applicable provisions of the Code of Professional Responsibility.

(b) Notices of substitution of counsel must be served and filed with OATH and the opposing party. A party may substitute counsel without leave of the administrative law judge as long as the substitution is made more than twenty days before trial. Applications for later substitutions of counsel will be granted freely absent prejudice or substantial delay of proceedings.








*§ 1-13 Conduct; Suspension from Practice at OATH.* ::


(a) Individuals appearing before OATH must comply with the rules of this chapter and any other applicable rules, and must comply with the orders and directions of the administrative law judge.

(b) Individuals appearing before OATH must conduct themselves at all times in a dignified, orderly and decorous manner. In particular, at the trial, all parties, their attorneys or representatives, and observers must address themselves only to the administrative law judge, avoid colloquy and argument among themselves, and cooperate with the orderly conduct of the trial.

(c) Attorneys and other representatives appearing before OATH must be familiar with the rules of this title.

(d) Attorneys appearing before OATH must conduct themselves in accordance with the canons, ethical considerations and disciplinary rules set forth in the code of professional responsibility in their representation of their clients, in their dealings with other parties, attorneys and representatives before OATH, and with OATH's administrative law judges and staff.

(e) Willful failure of any person to abide by the standards of conduct stated in paragraphs (a) through (d) of this section, may, in the discretion of the administrative law judge, be cause for the imposition of sanctions. Such sanctions may include formal admonishment or reprimand, assessment of costs or imposition of a fine, exclusion of the offending person from the proceedings, exclusion or limitation of evidence, adverse evidentiary inference, adverse disposition of the case, in whole or in part, or other sanctions as the administrative law judge may determine to be appropriate. The imposition of sanctions may be made after a reasonable opportunity to be heard. The form of the trial will depend upon the nature of the conduct and the circumstances of the case.

(f) In the event that an attorney or other representative of a party persistently fails to abide by the standards of conduct stated in paragraphs (a) through (d) of this section, the Chief Administrative Law Judge may, upon notice to the attorney or representative and a reasonable opportunity to rebut the claims against him or her, suspend that attorney or representative from appearing at OATH, either for a specified period of time or indefinitely until the attorney or representative demonstrates to the satisfaction of the Chief Administrative Law Judge that the basis for the suspension no longer exists.








*§ 1-14 Ex Parte Communications.* ::


(a) Except for ministerial matters, on consent, in an emergency, or as provided in 48 RCNY § 1-31(a), communications with the administrative law judge concerning a case must only occur with all parties present. If an administrative law judge receives an ex parte communication concerning the merits of a case to which he or she is assigned, then he or she must promptly disclose the communication by placing it on the record, in detail, including all written and oral communications and identifying all individuals with whom he or she has communicated. A party desiring to rebut the ex parte communication will be allowed to do so upon request.

(b) Communications between OATH and a party docketing a case, to the extent necessary to the placement of a case on the trial calendar or conference calendar pursuant to 48 RCNY § 1-26(a), will be deemed to be ministerial communications. Communications between OATH and a party docketing a case, to the extent necessary to a request for expedited calendaring pursuant to 48 RCNY § 1-26(c), will be deemed to be emergency communications.









**Subchapter C: Pre-trial Matters**



*§ 1-21 Designation of OATH.* ::


Where necessary under the provision of law governing a particular category of cases, the agency head will designate the Chief Administrative Law Judge of OATH, or such administrative law judges as the Chief Administrative Law Judge may assign, to hear such cases.








*§ 1-22 The Petition.* ::


The petition must include a short and plain statement of the matters to be adjudicated, and, where appropriate, specifically allege the incident, activity or behavior at issue as well as the date, time, and place of occurrence. The petition must also identify the law, rule, regulation, contract provision, or policy that was allegedly violated and provide a statement of the relief requested. If the petition does not comply with this provision, the administrative law judge may direct, on the motion of a party or sua sponte, that the petitioner re-plead the petition.








*§ 1-23 Service of the Petition.* ::


(a) The petitioner must serve the respondent with the petition. The petition must be accompanied by a notice of the following: the respondent's right to file an answer and the deadline to do so under 48 RCNY § 1-24; the respondent's right to representation by an attorney or other representative; and the requirement that a person representing the respondent must file a notice of appearance with OATH. The notice must include the statement that OATH's rules of practice and procedure are published in Title 48 of the Rules of the City of New York, and that copies of OATH's rules are available at OATH's offices or on OATH's website www.nyc.gov/oath.

(b) Service of the petition must be made pursuant to statute, rule, contract, or other provision of law applicable to the type of proceeding being initiated. Absent any such applicable law, service of the petition must be made in a manner reasonably calculated to achieve actual notice to the respondent. Service by certified mail, return receipt requested, contemporaneously with service by regular first-class mail, will be presumed to be reasonably calculated to achieve actual notice. Appropriate proof of service must be maintained.

(c) A copy of the petition and accompanying notices, with proof of service, must be filed with OATH at or before the commencement of the trial.








*§ 1-24 Answer.* ::


The respondent may serve and file an answer to the petition within eight days of service of the petition if service was personal, or within thirteen days of service of the petition if service was by mail, unless a different time is fixed by the administrative law judge. In the discretion of the administrative law judge, the respondent may be required to serve and file an answer. Failure to file an answer where required, may result in sanctions, including those specified in 48 RCNY § 1-33(e).






*§ 1-25 Amendment of Pleadings.* ::


Amendments of pleadings must be made as promptly as possible. If a pleading is to be amended less than twenty-five days before the commencement of the trial, amendment may be made only on consent of the parties or by leave of the administrative law judge on motion.








*§ 1-26 Docketing the Case.* ::


(a) A case must be docketed by filing with OATH a completed intake sheet, and either a petition or a written application for relief. Parties are encouraged to docket cases by electronic means. When a case is docketed, OATH will place it on the trial calendar, the conference calendar, or on open status. Absent prejudice, cases involving the same respondent or respondents will be scheduled for joint trials or conferences, as will cases alleging different respondents' involvement in the same incident or incidents.

(b) When a case is docketed, it will be given an index number and assigned to an administrative law judge. Assignments will be made and changed in the discretion of the Chief Administrative Law Judge or his or her designee, and motions concerning such assignments will not be entertained except pursuant to 48 RCNY § 1-27.

(c) OATH may determine that the case is not ready for trial or conference and may adjourn the trial or conference, or may remove the case from the trial or conference calendar and place it on open status. In addition, OATH may determine that the case should proceed on an expedited basis, and may direct expedited procedures, including expedited pre-trial and post-trial procedures, shortened notice periods, and/or expedited calendaring.

(d) The party docketing a case may do so ex parte. If the case is placed on the conference calendar or the trial calendar rather than on open status, the party may at the time of docketing also select a trial date and/or conference date ex parte. However, OATH encourages selection of trial and conference dates by all parties jointly. In the event that a party selects a trial date or a conference date ex parte, that party must serve the notice of conference or trial required by 48 RCNY § 1-28, within one business day of selecting that date. Whenever practicable, such notice must be served by personal delivery or electronic means.

(e) Cases docketed with the Trials Division are subject to review by the Chief Administrative Law Judge who shall determine whether the case should proceed at the Trials Division or removed to the Hearings Division.








*§ 1-27 Disqualification of Administrative Law Judges.* ::


(a) A motion for disqualification of an administrative law judge must be addressed to that administrative law judge, accompanied by a statement of the reasons for such application, and made as soon as practicable after a party has reasonable cause to believe that grounds for disqualification exist.

(b) The administrative law judge will be disqualified for bias, prejudice, interest, or any other cause for which a judge may be disqualified in accordance with § 14 of the Judiciary Law. In addition, an administrative law judge may, sua sponte or on motion of any party, withdraw from any case, where in the administrative law judge's discretion, his/her ability to provide a fair and impartial adjudication might reasonably be questioned.

(c) If the administrative law judge determines that his or her disqualification or withdrawal is warranted on grounds that apply to all of the existing administrative law judges, the administrative law judge must state that determination, and the reasons for that determination, in writing or orally on the record, and may recommend to the Chief Administrative Law Judge that the case be assigned to a special administrative law judge to be appointed temporarily by the Chief Administrative Law Judge. The Chief Administrative Law Judge will either accept that recommendation, or, upon a determination and reasons stated in writing or orally on the record, reject that recommendation. A special administrative law judge will have all of the authority granted to administrative law judges under this title.








*§ 1-28 Notice of Conference or Trial.* ::


(a) When a case is placed on either the trial calendar or the conference calendar, and within the time provided in 48 RCNY § 1-26(d), if applicable, the party that placed the case on the calendar must serve each other party with notice of the following: the date, time and place of the trial or conference; each party's right to representation by an attorney or other representative at the trial or conference; the requirement that a person representing a party at the trial or conference must file a notice of appearance with OATH prior to the trial or conference; and, in a notice of a trial served by the petitioner, the fact that failure of the respondent or an authorized representative of the respondent to appear at the hearing may result in a declaration of default, and a waiver of the right to a trial or other disposition against the respondent. The notice may be served personally or by mail, and appropriate proof of service must be maintained. A copy of the notice of conference, with proof of service, must be filed with OATH at or before the commencement of the conference. A copy of the notice of trial, with proof of service, must be filed with OATH at or before the commencement of the trial.

(b) When multiple petitions against a single respondent, or petitions against multiple respondents, are placed on the calendar or calendar conference for joint trial or conference pursuant to 48 RCNY § 1-26(a), notice of trial or notice of conference pursuant to this section must include notice of such joinder.








*§ 1-29 Scheduling Other Conferences.* ::


In the discretion of the administrative law judge, and whether or not a case has been on the conference calendar, conferences may be scheduled on application of either party or sua sponte. 






*§ 1-30 Conduct of Conferences.* ::


(a) All parties are required to attend conferences as scheduled unless timely application is made to the administrative law judge. Participants must be prompt and prepared to begin on time. No particular format for conducting the conference is required. The structure of the conference may be tailored to the circumstances of the particular case. The administrative law judge may propose mediation and, where the parties consent, may refer the parties to the Center for Creative Conflict Resolution or other qualified mediators. In the discretion of the administrative law judge, conferences may be conducted by telephone.

(b) At the conference, all parties must be fully prepared to discuss all aspects of the case, including the formulation and simplification of issues, the possibility of obtaining admissions or stipulations of fact and of admissibility or authenticity of documents, the order of proof and of witnesses, discovery issues, legal issues, pre-hearing applications, scheduling, and settlement of the case.

(c) In the event that the case is not settled at the conference, outstanding pre-trial matters, including discovery issues, must be raised during the conference. In the event that the case is not settled at the conference, a trial date may be set, if such a date has not already been set. The parties will be expected to know their availability and the availability of their witnesses for trial.








*§ 1-31 Settlement Conferences and Agreements.* ::


(a) Prior to a conference at which settlement is to be discussed, the administrative law judge assigned to the conference may require each party to provide a pre-conference letter. The pre-conference letter must be sent solely to the administrative law judge by fax or e-mail and marked prominently "CONFIDENTIAL MATERIAL FOR USE AT SETTLEMENT CONFERENCE." The pre-conference letter must state succinctly:

   (1) the history of settlement negotiations, if any;

   (2) the party's settlement offer and the rationale for it; and

   (3) any other facts that would be helpful to the administrative law judge in preparation for the conference.

(b) If settlement is to be discussed at the conference, each party must have an individual possessing authority to settle the matter, either present at the conference or readily accessible. A settlement conference will be conducted by an administrative law judge or other individual designated by the Chief Administrative Law Judge, other than the administrative law judge assigned to hear the case. During settlement discussions, upon notice to the parties, the administrative law judge or other person conducting the conference may confer with each party and/or representative separately.

(c) All settlement offers, whether or not made at a conference, will be confidential and will be inadmissible at trial of any case. Administrative law judges must not be called to testify in any proceeding concerning statements made at a settlement conference.

(d) A settlement must be reduced to writing, or, in the discretion of the administrative law judge, placed on the record. In the event that a settlement is reached other than at a conference, OATH must be notified immediately pursuant to 48 RCNY § 1-32(f). Copies of all written settlement agreements must be sent promptly to OATH.








*§ 1-32 Adjournments.* ::


(a) Applications for adjournments of conferences or trials will be governed by this section and by 48 RCNY § 1-34 or § 1-50. Conversion of a trial date to a conference date, or from conference to trial, will be deemed to be an adjournment.

(b) Applications to adjourn conferences or trials must be made to the assigned administrative law judge as soon as the need for the adjournment becomes apparent. Applications for adjournments are addressed at the discretion of the administrative law judge, and will be granted only for good cause. Although consent of all parties to a request for an adjournment will be a factor in favor of granting the request, such consent will not by itself constitute good cause for an adjournment. Delay in seeking an adjournment will militate against grant of the request.

(c) If a party selects a trial or conference date without consulting with or obtaining the consent of another party pursuant to 48 RCNY § 1-26(d), an application for an adjournment of such date by that other party, especially if such application is based upon a scheduling conflict, will be decided with due regard to the ex parte nature of the case scheduling.

(d) An attorney must file an affirmation of actual engagement prior to a ruling on an adjournment sought on that basis. Such affirmation must state the name and nature of the conflicting matter, the court or tribunal hearing the matter, the judge before whom it is scheduled, the date that the conflicting engagement became known to counsel, and the date, time, place and approximate duration of the engagement.

(e) Approved adjournments, other than adjournments granted on the record, must be promptly confirmed in writing by the applicant, to all parties and to the administrative law judge.

(f) Withdrawal of a case from the calendar by the petitioner will not be subject to the "good cause" requirement of subdivision (b) of this section. However, such withdrawal, other than pursuant to settlement agreement or other final disposition of the case, will be permitted only upon application to the administrative law judge, who may grant or deny the application, either in full or upon stated terms and conditions.

(g) At the discretion of the administrative law judge, a grant of an adjournment may be conditioned upon the imposition of costs for travel, lost earnings and witness fees, which may be assessed against the party causing the need for an adjournment.

(h) If an administrative law judge determines that a case is not ready for trial or conference and that an adjournment is inappropriate, the judge may remove the case from the calendar. Unless otherwise directed by the administrative law judge, the case will be administratively closed if the parties do not restore the matter to the calendar within 30 days.








*§ 1-33 Discovery.* ::


(a) Requests for production of documents, for identification of trial witnesses, and for inspection of real evidence to be introduced at the trial may be directed by any party to any other party without leave of the administrative law judge.

(b) Depositions must only be taken upon motion for good cause shown. Other discovery devices, including interrogatories, will not be permitted except upon agreement among the parties or upon motion for good cause shown. Demands for bills of particulars will be deemed to be interrogatories. Resort to such extraordinary discovery devices will not generally be cause for adjournment of a conference or trial.

(c) Discovery must be requested and completed promptly, so that each party may reasonably prepare for trial. A demand for identification of witnesses, for production of documents, or for inspection of real evidence to be introduced at trial must be made not less than twenty days before trial, or not less than twenty-five days if service of the demand is by mail. An answer to a discovery request must be made within fifteen days of receipt of the request, or within ten days if service of the answer is by mail. An objection to a discovery request must be made as promptly as possible, but in any event within the time for an answer to that request. Different times may be fixed by consent of the parties, or by the administrative law judge for good cause. Notwithstanding the foregoing time periods, where the notice of the trial is served less than twenty-five days in advance of trial, discovery must proceed as quickly as possible, and time periods may be fixed by consent of the parties or by the administrative law judge.

(d) (1) Parties are encouraged to resolve discovery disputes without the intervention of an administrative law judge. A party objecting to discovery should immediately commence discussion with the requesting party to clarify and possibly resolve the dispute.

   (2) Any unresolved discovery dispute must be presented to the assigned administrative law judge sufficiently in advance of the trial to allow a timely determination. A written motion to compel discovery must be served on all parties and the administrative law judge assigned to conduct the trial. The motion must state what efforts the parties have made to resolve discovery disputes. Any party objecting to a discovery motion must state, in writing, the grounds for the objection. In deciding whether to grant a request, the administrative law judge may consider the timeliness of discovery requests and responses and of discovery-related motions, the complexity of the case, the need for the requested discovery, and the relative resources of the parties.

   (3) In ruling upon a discovery motion, the administrative law judge may deny the motion, order compliance with a discovery request, order other discovery, or take other appropriate action. The administrative law judge may grant or deny discovery upon specified conditions, including payment by one party to another of stated expenses of the discovery. Failure to comply with an order compelling discovery may result in imposition of appropriate sanctions upon the disobedient party, attorney or representative, such as the sanctions set forth in 48 RCNY § 1-13(e), the preclusion of witnesses or evidence, drawing of adverse inferences, or, under exceptional circumstances, removal of the case from the calendar, dismissal of the case, or declaration of default.








*§ 1-34 Pre-Trial Motions.* ::


(a) Pre-trial motions will be consolidated and addressed to the administrative law judge as promptly as possible, and sufficiently in advance of the trial to permit a timely decision to be made. Delay in presenting such a motion may, in the discretion of the administrative law judge, weigh against the granting of the motion, or may lead to the granting of the motion upon appropriate conditions.

(b) A moving party must request in writing an informal conference with the administrative law judge before any dispositive motion will be heard. The request must, in no more than two pages, set forth the nature of the motion.

(c) The administrative law judge may in his or her discretion permit pre-trial motions to be made orally, including by telephone, electronic means, or in writing. The administrative law judge may require the parties to submit legal briefs on any motion. Parties are encouraged to make pre-trial motions, or to conduct preliminary discussions and scheduling of such motions, by conference telephone call or by electronic means to the administrative law judge.

(d) When a motion is made on papers, the motion papers must state the grounds upon which the motion is made and the relief or order sought. Motion papers must include notice to all other parties of their time pursuant to subdivision (d) of this section to serve papers in opposition to the motion. Motion papers and papers in opposition must be served on all other parties, and proof of service must be filed with the papers. The filing of motion papers or papers in opposition by a representative who has not previously appeared will constitute the filing of a notice of appearance by that representative, and must conform to the requirements of 48 RCNY § 1-11(b).

(e) Unless otherwise directed by the administrative law judge upon application or sua sponte, the opposing party must file and serve responsive papers no later than eight days after service of the motion papers if service of the motion papers was personal or by electronic means, and no later than thirteen days after service if service of the motion papers was by mail.

(f) The moving party must not file reply papers unless authorized by the administrative law judge, and oral argument will not be scheduled except upon the direction of the administrative law judge.

(g) Nothing in this section limits the applicability of other provisions to specific pre-trial motions. For instance, an application for withdrawal or substitution of counsel is also governed by 48 RCNY § 1-12; an application for an adjournment is also governed by 48 RCNY § 1-32; and an application for issuance of a subpoena is also governed by 48 RCNY § 1-43.









**Subchapter D: Trials and Hearings**



*§ 1-41 Consolidation; Separate Trials.* ::


All or portions of separate cases may be consolidated for trial, or portions of a single case may be severed for separate trials, in the discretion of the administrative law judge. Consolidation or severance may be ordered on motion or sua sponte, in furtherance of justice, efficiency or convenience.






*§ 1-42 Witnesses and Documents.* ::


The parties must have all of their witnesses available on the trial date. A party intending to introduce documents into evidence must bring to trial copies of those documents for the administrative law judge, the witness, and the other parties. Repeated failure to comply with this section may be cause for sanctions, as set forth in 48 RCNY § 1-13(e).








*§ 1-43 Subpoenas.* ::


(a) A subpoena ad testificandum requiring the attendance of a person to give testimony prior to or at a trial or a subpoena duces tecum requiring the production of documents or things at or prior to a trial may be issued only by the administrative law judge upon application of a party or sua sponte.

(b) A request by a party that the administrative law judge issue a subpoena will be deemed to be a motion, and must be made in compliance with 48 RCNY § 1-34 or 48 RCNY § 1-50, as appropriate; provided, however, that such a motion must be made on 24 hours' notice by electronic means or personal delivery of papers, including a copy of the proposed subpoena, unless the administrative law judge directs otherwise. The proposed subpoena may be prepared by completion of a form subpoena available from OATH. The making and scheduling of requests for issuance of subpoenas by telephone conference call to the administrative law judge or by electronic means is encouraged.

(c) Subpoenas must be served in the manner provided by § 2303 of the Civil Practice Law and Rules, unless the administrative law judge directs otherwise. The party requesting the issuance of a subpoena will bear the cost of service, and of witness and mileage fees, which will be the same as for a trial subpoena in the Supreme Court of the State of New York.

(d) In the event of a dispute concerning a subpoena after the subpoena is issued, informal resolution must be attempted with the party who requested issuance of the subpoena. If the dispute is not thus resolved, a motion to quash, modify or enforce the subpoena must be made to the administrative law judge.








*§ 1-44 Interpreters.* ::


(a) OATH will provide language assistance services to a party or their witnesses who are in need of such services to communicate at a trial or conference. All requests for language assistance must be made to OATH's calendar unit.

(b) A request for language assistance by telephone may be made at any time before the trial or conference.

(c) A request for in-person interpretation must be made at least five (5) business days before the trial or conference

(d) A request for sign language interpretation must be made at least three (3) calendar days before the trial or conference.








*§ 1-45 Failure to Appear.* ::


All parties, attorneys and other representatives are required to be present at OATH and prepared to proceed at the time scheduled for commencement of trial. Commencement of trial, or of any session of trial, will not be delayed beyond the scheduled starting time except for good cause as determined in the discretion of the administrative law judge. Absent a finding of good cause, and to the extent permitted by the law applicable to the claims asserted in the petition, the administrative law judge may direct that the trial proceed in the absence of any missing party or representative, render a disposition of the case adverse to the missing party, or take other appropriate measures, including the imposition of sanctions listed in 48 RCNY § 1-13(e). Relief from the direction of the administrative law judge may be had only upon motion brought as promptly as possible pursuant to 48 RCNY § 1-50 or § 1-52.

Traditional trial sequence may be altered by the administrative law judge for convenience of the parties, attorneys, witnesses, or OATH, where substantial prejudice will not result.

(b) The administrative law judge may limit examination, the presentation of testimonial, documentary or other evidence, and the submission of rebuttal evidence.

(c) In the discretion of the administrative law judge, closing statements may be made orally or in writing. On motion of the parties, or sua sponte, the administrative law judge may direct written post-trial submissions, including legal briefing, proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law, or any other pertinent matter.








*§ 1-47 Evidence Pertaining to Penalty or Relief.* ::


(a) A separate trial will not be held as to the penalty to be imposed or the relief to be granted in the event that the petition is sustained in whole or in part.

(b) In the event that a personnel file, abstract of a personnel file, driver record, owner record, or other similar or analogous file is not admitted into evidence at the trial on the merits, the administrative law judge, upon determining that the petition will be sustained in whole or in part, may request that the petitioner forward such file or record to the administrative law judge for consideration relative to penalty or relief. That request may be conveyed to the petitioner or the petitioner's representative ex parte and without further notice to the respondent. The petitioner must forward only the requested file or record, without accompanying material, and such file or record must include only material which is available from the petitioner for inspection by the respondent as of right. In his or her report and recommendation, the administrative law judge will refer to any material from such file or record relied on in formulating the recommendation as to penalty or other relief.








*§ 1-48 Official Notice.* ::

In addition, all parties are deemed to have notice that official notice may be taken of other regulations, directives, guidelines, and similar documents that are lawfully applicable to the parties, provided that any such materials that are unpublished are on file with OATH sufficiently before trial of the case to enable all parties to address at trial any issue as to the applicability or meaning of any such materials. Unpublished materials on file with OATH will be available for inspection by any party or attorney or representative of a party.








*§ 1-49 Public Access to Proceedings.* ::


(a) Other than settlement conferences, all proceedings are open to the public, unless the administrative law judge finds that a legally recognized ground exists for closure of all or a portion of the proceeding, or unless closure is required by law. Trial witnesses may be excluded from proceedings other than their own testimony in the discretion of the administrative law judge.

(b) No person may make or cause to be made a stenographic, electronic, audio, audio-visual or other verbatim or photographic reproduction of any trial or other proceeding, whether such trial or other proceeding is conducted in person, by telephone, or otherwise, except upon application to the administrative law judge or as otherwise provided by law (e.g. N.Y. Civil Rights Law, § 52). Such application must be addressed to the discretion of the administrative law judge, who may deny the application or grant it in full, in part, or upon such conditions as the administrative law judge deems necessary to preserve the decorum of the proceedings and to protect the interests of the parties, witnesses and any other concerned persons.

(c) Transcripts of proceedings made a part of the record by the administrative law judge will be the official record of proceedings at OATH, notwithstanding the existence of any other transcript or recording, whether or not authorized under the previous subdivision of this section.

(d) Unless the administrative law judge finds that legally recognized grounds exist to omit information from a decision, all decisions will be published without redaction. To the extent applicable law or rules require that particular information remain confidential, including but not limited to the name of a party or witness or an individual's medical records, such information will not be published in a decision. On the motion of a party, or sua sponte, the administrative law judge may determine that publication of certain information will violate privacy rights set forth in applicable law or rules and may take appropriate steps to ensure that such information is not published.








*§ 1-50 Trial Motions.* ::


Motions may be made during the trial orally or in writing. Trial motions made in writing must satisfy the requirements of 48 RCNY § 1-34. The administrative law judge may, in his or her discretion, require that any trial motion be briefed or otherwise supported in writing. In cases referred to OATH for disposition by report and recommendation to the head of the agency, motions addressed to the sufficiency of the petition or the sufficiency of the petitioner's evidence will be reserved until closing statements.








*§ 1-51 The Transcript.* ::


Trials will be stenographically or electronically recorded, and the recordings will be transcribed, unless the administrative law judge directs otherwise. In the discretion of the administrative law judge, matters other than the trial may be recorded and such recordings may be transcribed. Transcripts will be made part of the record, and will be made available upon request or as required by law.








*§ 1-51.1 Decision Made on the Record.* ::


An administrative law judge may dispose of a case by making a decision or report and recommendation on the record.






*§ 1-52 Post-Trial Motions.* ::


Post-trial motions must be made in writing, in conformity with the requirements of 48 RCNY § 1-34, to the administrative law judge, except that after issuance of a report and recommendation in a case referred to OATH for such motions, as well as comments on the report and recommendation to the extent that such comments are authorized by law, must be addressed to the deciding authority.

All other applications or motions for discovery shall be made to a Hearing Officer at the commencement of the hearing and the Hearing Officer may order such further discovery as is deemed appropriate in his or her discretion.

(c) Upon the failure of any party to properly respond to a lawful discovery order or request or such party's wrongful refusal to answer questions or produce documents, the Hearing Officer may take whatever action he or she deems appropriate including but not limited to preclusion of evidence or witnesses. It shall not be necessary for a party to have been subpoenaed to appear or produce documents at any properly ordered discovery proceeding for such sanctions to be applicable.









**Subchapter C: Hearings**



*§ 6-08 Proceedings before the OATH Hearings Division.* ::


(a) Issuance and Filing of Summons.

   (1) The petitioner must file an original or a copy of the summons, together with proof of service, with the Tribunal prior to the first scheduled hearing date. Electronic filing of the summons and proof of service is required unless the Tribunal grants an exception. Failure to timely file all proofs of service shall not divest the Tribunal of jurisdiction to proceed with a hearing or to issue a default order.

   (2) Notwithstanding paragraph one of this subdivision, where property has been seized, the Tribunal may adjudicate a summons after it is served and before it is filed.

(b) Service of the Summons. There must be service of the summons.

   (1) Service of a summons in the following manner will be considered sufficient:

      (i) The summons may be served in person upon:

         (A) the person alleged to have committed the violation,

         (B) the permittee, licensee or registrant,

         (C) the person who was required to hold the permit, license or to register,

         (D) a member of the partnership or other group concerned,

         (E) an officer of the corporation,

         (F) a member of a limited liability company,

         (G) a managing or general agent, or

         (H) any other person of suitable age and discretion as may be appropriate, depending on the organization or character of the person, business or institution charged.

      (ii) Alternatively, the summons may be served by mail deposited with the U.S. Postal Service, or other mailing service, to any such person at the address of the premises that is the subject of the summons or, as may be appropriate, at the residence or business address of:

         (A) the alleged violator,

         (B) the individual who is listed as the permittee, licensee or applicant in the permit or license or in the application for a permit or license,

         (C) the registrant listed in the registration form, or

         (D) the person filing a notification of an entity's existence with the applicable governmental agency where no permit, license or registration is required.

         If the summons is served by mail, documentation of mailing will be accepted as proof of service of the summons.

   (2) A summons may be served pursuant to the requirements of § 1049-a(d)(2) of the New York City Charter, 35 RCNY Chapter 68, or as provided by the statute, rule, or other provision of law governing the violation alleged. For the purpose of serving a summons pursuant to New York City Charter § 1049-a(d)(2)(a)(i) and (ii), the term "reasonable attempt" as used in New York City Charter § 1049-a(d)(2)(b) may be satisfied by a single attempt to effectuate service upon the Respondent, or another person upon whom service may be made, in accordance with Article 3 of the Civil Practice Law and Rules or Article 3 of the Business Corporation Law.

   (3) The Tribunal's decision may be automatically docketed in Civil Court where the summons has been served in accordance with § 1049-a(d)(2) of the New York City Charter or the statute or rule providing for such docketing. Where a summons is lawfully served in a manner other than that provided in § 1049-a(d)(2) or such other provision of law, the Tribunal may hear and determine such summons but the decision will not be automatically docketed in Civil Court or any other place provided for entry of civil judgments without further court proceedings.

(c) Contents of Summons. The summons must contain, at a minimum:

   (1) The name and address, when known, of a Respondent;

   (2) A clear and concise statement sufficient to inform the Respondent with reasonable certainty and clarity of the essential facts alleged to constitute the violation or the violations charged, including the date, time where applicable, and place when and where such facts were observed;

   (3) Information adequate to provide specific notification of the section or sections of the law, rule or regulation alleged to have been violated;

   (4) Information adequate for the Respondent to calculate the maximum penalty authorized to be imposed if the facts constituting the violation are found to be as alleged;

   (5) Notification of the date, time and place when and where a hearing will be held by the Tribunal or instructions to the Respondent on how to schedule a hearing date. Such date must be at least fifteen (15) calendar days after the summons was served, unless another date is required by applicable law. Where Respondent waives the fifteen (15) day notice and requests an expedited hearing, the Tribunal may assign the case for immediate hearing, upon appropriate notice to Petitioner and opportunity for Petitioner to appear.

   (6) Notification that failure to appear at the place, date and time designated for the hearing will be deemed a waiver of the right to a hearing, thereby authorizing the rendering of a default decision; and

   (7) Information adequate to inform the Respondent of his or her rights under 48 RCNY § 6-09.

(d) In the interest of convenient, expeditious and complete determination of cases involving the same or similar issues or the same parties, the Tribunal may consolidate two (2) or more summonses for adjudication at one (1) hearing.

(e) Where a Petitioner withdraws a summons, even if it has been adjudicated, is open or has been decided by the Tribunal, the Petitioner must promptly notify the Tribunal and the Respondent in writing. Thereafter the Tribunal will issue a decision indicating the summons has been withdrawn.








*§ 6-09 Appearances.* ::


(a) Where the summons states that a penalty for the cited violation may be paid by mail prior to the scheduled hearing or other applicable date provided, a Respondent may admit to the violation charged and pay the penalty in the manner and by the time directed by the summons. Payment in full is deemed an admission of liability and no further hearing or appeal will be allowed.

(b) A Respondent may appear for a hearing by:

   (1) Appearing in person at the place, date and time scheduled for the hearing; or

   (2) Sending an authorized representative to appear on behalf of such person at the place, date and time scheduled for the hearing who is:

      (i) an attorney admitted to practice law in New York State, or

      (ii) a representative registered to appear before the Tribunal pursuant to 48 RCNY § 6-23, or

      (iii) any other person, subject to the provisions of 48 RCNY § 6-23; or

   (3) Appearing pursuant to 48 RCNY § 6-10, when the opportunity to appear remotely is offered by the Tribunal, unless the summons specifies that a Respondent must appear in person at a hearing.

(c) In addition to the persons allowed to appear in paragraph (b), the current owner of a property may appear on behalf of the prior owner of the property, if the summons:

   (1) names the prior owner,

   (2) is a premises-related violation, and

   (3) was issued after title to the property was transferred.

   However, the current property owner may only appear for the purposes of presenting a deed indicating when title passed. The current owner of the property may only present a defense on the merits if the current owner agrees to substitute him or herself for the prior owner, waiving all defenses based on service.

(d) Failure to Appear by Respondent. A Respondent's failure to appear at the scheduled time or to make a timely request to reschedule pursuant to 48 RCNY § 6-05 constitutes a default to the charges, and subjects the Respondent to penalties in accordance with 48 RCNY § 6-20.

(e) A Petitioner may appear for a hearing through an authorized representative at the place, date and time scheduled for the hearing or by other remote methods when the opportunity to do so is offered by the Tribunal.

(f) Failure to Appear by Petitioner. If a Petitioner fails to appear at the scheduled place, date and time, the hearing may proceed without the Petitioner.

(g) Discretionary Intervention. Any person may move for discretionary intervention. The Hearing Officer, taking into account the need to conduct an orderly, expeditious and fair hearing, may permit such intervenor if good cause is shown or if the intervenor is in a position to assist in the proof or defense of the proceeding. Such intervenor will be allowed to participate in the proceeding as the Hearing Officer may direct. In determining the extent of the intervenor's participation, the Hearing Officer will consider the avoidance of unfairness to the parties and the intervenor, and the avoidance of undue delay. An intervenor is not a party to the proceeding and has no standing to appeal the Hearing Officer's decision.








*§ 6-10 Remote Adjudications.* ::


(a) When the opportunity to do so is offered by the Tribunal, a Respondent may contest a violation by mail, online, by telephone or by other remote methods.

(b) Adjudication by Mail.

   (1) A written submission in an adjudication by mail must be received by the Tribunal before the scheduled hearing date or bear a postmark or other proof of mailing indicating that it was mailed to the Tribunal before the scheduled hearing date. If a request bearing such a postmark or proof of mailing is received by the Tribunal after a first default decision has been issued on that summons, such default will be vacated.

   (2) The written submission must contain any denials, admissions and explanations related to the individual violations charged, and documents, exhibits or witness statements, if any, to be considered as evidence in support of Respondent's defense. Violations that are not denied or explained will be deemed to have been admitted; defenses not specifically raised will be deemed to have been waived.

   (3) After a review by a Hearing Officer of the written submission, the Tribunal will:

      (i) issue a written decision and send the decision to the parties; or

      (ii) require the submission of additional documentary evidence; or

      (iii) require an in-person hearing or hearing by telephone, in which case the parties will be notified.

(c) Adjudication Online.

   (1) Submissions in an adjudication online must be received by the Tribunal before or on the scheduled hearing date.

   (2) The submission must contain any denials, admissions and explanations related to the individual violations charged, and documents, exhibits or witness statements, if any, to be considered as evidence in support of Respondent's defense. Violations that are not denied or explained will be deemed to have been admitted; defenses not specifically raised will be deemed to have been waived.

   (3) After a review by a Hearing Officer of the submission, the Tribunal will:

      (i) issue a written decision and send the decision to the parties; or

      (ii) require the submission of additional documentary evidence; or

      (iii) require an in-person hearing or hearing by telephone, in which case the parties will be notified.

(d) Adjudication by Telephone. Before or on the scheduled hearing date, a respondent may request a hearing by telephone by contacting the Tribunal.








*§ 6-11 Hearing Procedures.* ::


(a) A hearing will be presided over by a Hearing Officer, proceed with reasonable expedition and order and, to the extent practicable, not be postponed or adjourned.

(b) Language assistance services at the hearing.

   (1) At the beginning of any hearing, the Hearing Officer will advise the Respondent of the availability of language assistance services. In determining whether language assistance services are necessary to assist the Respondent in communicating meaningfully with the Hearing Officer and others at the hearing, the Hearing Officer will consider all relevant factors, including but not limited to the following:

      (i) information from Tribunal administrative personnel identifying a Respondent as requiring language assistance services to communicate meaningfully with a Hearing Officer;

      (ii) a request by the Respondent for language assistance services; and

      (iii) even if language assistance services were not requested by the Respondent, the Hearing Officer's own assessment whether language assistance services are necessary to enable meaningful communication with the Respondent.

      If the Respondent requests an interpreter and the Hearing Officer determines that an interpreter is not needed, that determination and the basis for the determination will be made on the record.

   (2) When required, language assistance services will be provided at hearings by a professional interpretation service that is made available by the Tribunal. If the professional interpretation service is not available for that language, the Respondent may request the use of another interpreter, in which case the Hearing Officer in his or her discretion may use the Respondent's requested interpreter. In exercising that discretion, the Hearing Officer will take into account all relevant factors, including but not limited to the following:

      (i) the apparent skills of the Respondent's requested interpreter;

      (ii) whether the Respondent's requested interpreter is a child under the age of eighteen (18);

      (iii) minimization of delay in the hearing process;

      (iv) maintenance of a clear and usable hearing record; and

      (v) whether the Respondent's requested interpreter is a potential witness who may testify at the hearing.

      The Hearing Officer's determination and the basis for this determination will be made on the record.

(c) When a party appears on more than one (1) summons on a single hearing day, the Tribunal has the discretion to determine the order in which the summonses will be heard.

(d) Each party has the right to present evidence, to examine and cross-examine witnesses, to make factual or legal arguments and to have other rights essential for due process and a fair and impartial hearing. Witnesses may be excluded from the hearing room, except while they are actually testifying.

   (8) Respondent's closing argument;

   (9) Petitioner's closing argument.

(g) A record will be made of all summonses filed, proceedings held, written evidence admitted and rulings rendered, and such record will be kept in the regular course of business for a period of time in accordance with applicable laws and regulations. Hearings will be mechanically, electronically or otherwise recorded by the Tribunal under the supervision of the Hearing Officer, and the original recording will be part of the record and will constitute the sole official record of the hearing. No other recording or photograph of the hearing may be made without prior written permission of the Tribunal. A copy of the recording will be provided upon request to the Tribunal. The Tribunal may charge a reasonable fee in accordance with Article 6 of the New York State Public Officers Law.

(h) Unless permitted or ordered by the Hearing Officer, parties are prohibited from submitting additional material or argument after the hearing has been completed.








*§ 6-12 Evidence.* ::


(a) Burden of Proof. The Petitioner has the burden of proving the factual allegations contained in the summons by a preponderance of the evidence. The Respondent has the burden of proving an affirmative defense, if any, by a preponderance of the evidence.

(b) Admissibility of Summons. If the summons is sworn to under oath or affirmed under penalty of perjury, the summons will be admitted as prima facie evidence of the facts stated therein. The summons may include the report of the inspector, public health sanitarian or other person who conducted the inspection or investigation that resulted in the summons. When such report is served with the summons, such report will also be prima facie evidence of the factual allegations contained in the report.

(c) Admissibility of Evidence. Relevant and reliable evidence may be admitted without regard to technical or formal rules or laws of evidence applicable in the courts of the State of New York. Irrelevant, immaterial, unreliable or unduly repetitious evidence will be excluded. Immaterial or irrelevant parts of an admissible document must be segregated and excluded to the extent practicable.

(d) Types of Evidence. Evidence at a hearing may include, but is not limited to, witness testimony, documents and objects. Documents may include, but are not limited to, affidavits or affirmations, business records or government records, photographs and other documents.

(e) Official Notice. Official notice may be taken of all facts of which judicial notice may be taken and other facts within the specialized knowledge and experience of the Tribunal or the Hearing Officer. Opportunity to disprove such noticed fact will be granted to any party making a timely motion.

(f) Objections. Objections to evidence must be timely and must briefly state the grounds relied upon. Rulings on all objections must appear on the record.








*§ 6-13 Hearing Officers.* ::

   (ii) an administrative law judge set forth in Title 19 of the New York City Administrative Code;

(e) Allow an amendment to a summons only upon a motion at any time if:

   (1) the subject of the amendment is reasonably within the scope of the original summons;

   (2) such amendment does not allege any additional violations based on an act not specified in the original summons;

   (3) such amendment does not allege an act that occurred after the original summons was served; and

   (4) such amendment does not affect the Respondent's right to have adequate notice of the allegations made against him or her.

(f) Request further evidence to be submitted by the Petitioner or Respondent;

(g) Make final or recommended decisions pursuant to applicable law, rule or regulation; and

(h) Take any other action authorized by applicable law, rule or regulation, or that is delegated by the Chief Administrative Law Judge.








*§ 6-14 Requests for Adjournment.* ::


(a) At the time of the scheduled hearing or upon motion, a Hearing Officer may adjourn a hearing for the testimony of the Inspector or a complaining witness only if:

   (1) Respondent consents or the Petitioner appears at the hearing, and

   (2) the Hearing Officer concludes that the Inspector's or witness's testimony is reasonably likely to be necessary to a fair hearing of the violations charged or of the defenses to those charges.

(b) If a Hearing Officer has adjourned a hearing:

   (1) solely for the purpose of obtaining the Inspector's testimony, and

   (2) the Respondent timely appears on the adjourned hearing date, and

   (3) the Inspector fails to timely appear on the adjourned hearing date,

the hearing shall not be further adjourned solely to obtain the testimony of such Inspector unless the Respondent consents to the second adjournment or the Hearing Officer determines that extraordinary circumstances warrant the second adjournment. "Extraordinary circumstances" are circumstances that could not have been reasonably foreseen by the Petitioner.

(c) A Hearing Officer may not adjourn a hearing on more than two (2) occasions because of the unavailability of the Inspector.

(d) For all other adjournment requests, a Hearing Officer may grant a request to adjourn the hearing to a later date only after a showing of good cause as determined by the Hearing Officer in his or her discretion. In deciding whether there is good cause for an adjournment, the Hearing Officer will consider:

   (1) Whether granting the adjournment is necessary for the party requesting the adjournment to effectively present the case;

   (2) Whether granting the adjournment is unfair to the other party;

   (3) Whether granting the adjournment will cause inconvenience to any witness;

   (4) The age of the case and the number of adjournments previously granted;

   (5) Whether the party requesting the adjournment had the opportunity to prepare for the scheduled hearing;

   (6) Whether the need for the adjournment is due to facts that are beyond the requesting party's control;

   (7) The balance of the need for efficient and expeditious adjudication of the case and the need for full and fair consideration of the issues relevant to the case; and

   (8) Any other fact that the Hearing Officer considers to be relevant to the request for an adjournment.

*§ 6-15 Appearances of Inspectors.* ::


In the event that the Inspector does not appear at the hearing, the Hearing Officer may adjourn the hearing pursuant to 48 RCNY § 6-14, or may proceed with the hearing without the inspector and sustain or dismiss all or part of the summons, as the Hearing Officer may deem appropriate.

*§ 6-17 Decisions.* ::


(a) Decisions. After a hearing, the Hearing Officer who presided over the hearing will promptly write a decision sustaining or dismissing each charge in the summons. The Tribunal will promptly serve the decision on all parties. Each decision will contain findings of fact and conclusions of law. Where a violation is sustained, the Hearing Officer will impose the applicable penalty, which may include a fine, penalty points, a suspension or revocation of the respondent's license or any other penalty authorized by applicable laws, rules and regulations.

(b) Except as provided in subdivision (c), the decision of the Hearing Officer is the final decision unless an appeal is filed pursuant to 48 RCNY § 6-19.

   (3) For all violations in which summonses are returnable to the Tribunal as authorized by the Board under § 1049-a of the New York City Charter and provisions of the New York City Administrative Code, any rules and regulations made thereunder, or provisions of New York State law, the Hearing Officer's decision is a recommended decision to the Board. If an appeal is not filed pursuant to 48 RCNY § 6-19, the Hearing Officer's recommended decision will be automatically adopted by the Board and will constitute the Board's final decision in the matter. The Board's final decision is also the final decision of the Tribunal.

(d) The Tribunal may, due to Tribunal needs or the unavailability of the Hearing Officer who heard the case, designate another Hearing Officer to write the recommended decision. The decision will state the reason for the designation and will be based on the record, which includes (i) the summons, (ii) all briefs filed and all exhibits received in evidence, and (iii) a complete audio recording of the hearing or, if a complete audio recording is unavailable for any reason, a complete transcript of the hearing.








*§ 6-18 Payment of Penalty.* ::


A copy of the decision, other than a default decision mailed or otherwise provided in accordance with 48 RCNY § 6-20, will be served immediately on the Respondent or on the Respondent's authorized representative, either personally or by mail. Any fines, penalties or restitution imposed must be paid within thirty (30) days of the date of the decision, or thirty-five (35) days if the decision was mailed, unless the agency responsible for collecting payment of the fines and penalties imposed enters into a payment plan with the Respondent.









**Subchapter D: Appeals**



*§ 6-19 Appeals.* ::


(a) A party may appeal, in whole or in part, a decision of a Hearing Officer. An appeal must contain a concise statement of the issues presented, specific objections to the findings of fact and conclusions of law set forth in the Hearing Officer's recommended decision, and arguments presenting clearly the points of law and facts relied on in support of the position taken on each issue. A party may not appeal a decision rendered on default, a denial of a motion to vacate a default decision, or a plea admitting the violations charged.

(b) Appeals decisions are made upon the record of the hearing. The record of the hearing includes all items enumerated in 48 RCNY § 6-11(g) as well as the Hearing Officer's written decision. The Appeals Unit will not consider any evidence that was not presented to the Hearing Officer. Except as provided in 48 RCNY § 5-04, the absence of a recording of the hearing does not prevent determination of the appeal.

(c) Appeals Procedure.

   (1) Within thirty (30) days of the date of service of the Hearing Officer's decision, or thirty-five (35) days if the decision was mailed, a party seeking review of the decision must file with the Tribunal an appeal on a form prescribed by the Tribunal and serve a copy of it on the non-appealing party. An appeal will be accepted by the Tribunal only if:

      (i) the appealing party files an appeal on the Tribunal's form; and

      (ii) the appealing party files proof that a copy of the appeal has been served on the non-appealing party; and

      (iii) Respondent provides proof of payment in full of any fines, penalties or restitution imposed by the decision, except as provided in subdivision (d).

   (2) Except as provided in 48 RCNY § 5-04, within thirty (30) days of being served with the appeal, or thirty-five (35) days if service is made by mail, the non-appealing party may file a response to the appeal. The response must be on a form prescribed by the Tribunal and will be accepted only if the non-appealing party serves a copy of the response on the other party and files proof of that service with the Tribunal.

   (3) An application may be made to the Tribunal to extend the time to file an appeal or a response to an appeal. Such request must be supported by evidence of impossibility or other explanation of inability to file timely. A copy of such application must be served on all parties, and proof of such service filed with the Tribunal.

   (4) Any application for a copy of the hearing recording must be made within the time allotted for the filing of an appeal or a response to an appeal. A copy of such application must be served upon all parties, and proof of such service filed with the Tribunal within the time allotted for filing an appeal or response to an appeal. In that event, the time within which to file an appeal or respond to an appeal will be extended by thirty (30) days from the date when such hearing recording is delivered or mailed to the requesting party.

   (5) Further filings with the Tribunal by either party are not permitted.

(d) Fines, penalties, and restitution. Filing an appeal will not delay the collection of any fine, penalty or restitution imposed by the decision. An appeal by or on behalf of a Respondent will not be permitted unless the fines, penalties or restitution imposed has been paid in full prior to or at the time of the filing of the appeal; laws, rules, or regulations provide for a waiver of prior payment of fines or penalties; the Tribunal grants a waiver of prior payment due to financial hardship; or the agency responsible for collecting payment of the fines or penalties imposed enters into a payment plan with the Respondent prior to or at the time of the filing of the appeal.

   (1) An application to the Tribunal for a waiver of prior payment due to financial hardship must be made before or at the time of the filing of the appeal and must be supported by evidence of financial hardship. The Chief Administrative Law Judge or his or her designee has the sole discretion to grant or deny a waiver due to financial hardship. Application for a waiver does not extend the time to appeal.

   (2) Notwithstanding paragraph (1), payment of restitution is not subject to waiver due to financial hardship. If a Hearing Officer has ordered payment of restitution, the Respondent must, prior to or at the time of the filing of the appeal, submit proof that the Respondent has deposited the amount of restitution with the agency responsible for collecting payment pending determination of the appeal.

(e) Appeals Decision.

   (1) When an appeal is filed, the Appeals Unit within the Tribunal will determine whether the facts contained in the findings of the Hearing Officer are supported by a preponderance of the evidence in the record, and whether the determinations of the Hearing Officer, as well as the penalties imposed, are supported by law. Except as provided in 48 RCNY §§ 3-15, 5-04 and 5-05, the Appeals Unit has the power to affirm, reverse, remand or modify the decision appealed from.

   (2) Except as provided in 48 RCNY §§ 3-15, 5-04 and 5-05, the Appeals Unit will promptly issue a written decision. Such decision is the final decision of the Tribunal, and judicial review of such decision may be sought pursuant to Article 78 of the CPLR. A copy of the decision will be delivered to the Petitioner and served on the Respondent by mail, stating the grounds upon which the decision is based. Where appropriate, the decision will order the repayment to the Respondent of any penalty that has been paid.

   (3) For summonses returnable to the Tribunal as authorized by the Board pursuant to § 1049-a of the New York City Charter and provisions of the New York City Administrative Code, any rules and regulations made thereunder, or provisions of New York State law, any decision of the Appeals Unit is a recommended decision to the Board. The Board or a panel consisting of members thereof will review the recommended decision pursuant to 48 RCNY § 3-15.

(a) A Respondent who fails to appear or to make a request to reschedule as required by these rules will be deemed to have defaulted.

*§ 6-21 Request for a New Hearing after a Failure to Appear (Motion to Vacate a Default).* ::


(a) Form of Motion. A motion to vacate a default is a request by a Respondent for a new hearing after the Respondent did not appear. The Respondent must make this motion by application to the Tribunal on a form approved by the Tribunal. The motion must be dated, contain a current mailing address for the Respondent; explain how and when the Respondent learned of the violation and be certified to under the penalties of perjury. If the motion is made by an attorney or other representative, the motion must explain the relationship between the Respondent and the person making the motion.

(b) A first motion to vacate a default by a Respondent that is submitted within sixty (60) days of the mailing or hand delivery date of the default decision will be granted. A motion to vacate a default that is submitted by mail must be postmarked within sixty (60) days of the mailing or hand delivery date of the default decision.

(c) A motion to vacate a default that is submitted after sixty (60) days of the date of the mailing or hand delivery date of the default decision must be filed within one (1) year of the date of the default decision and be accompanied by a statement setting forth a reasonable excuse for the Respondent's failure to appear and any documents to support the motion to vacate the default. The Hearing Officer will determine whether a new hearing will be granted.

(d) Reasons for Failing to Appear. In determining whether a Respondent has shown a reasonable excuse for failing to appear at a hearing, the Hearing Officer will consider:

   (1) Whether the summons was properly served pursuant to applicable law.

   (2) Whether the Respondent was properly named, including but not limited to:

      (i) Whether the Respondent was cited generally as "Owner" or "Agent" on all copies of the summons served on the Respondent; or

      (ii) Whether the Respondent was an improper party when the summons was issued, such as:

         (a) An individual who was deceased or legally incompetent on the hearing date upon which the Respondent did not appear; or

         (b) For a premises-related violation, the Respondent was not the owner, agent, lessee, tenant occupant or person in charge of or in control of the place of occurrence on the date of the offense.

      A decision to grant a motion to vacate a default is not a final decision on the issues of whether the Respondent was properly served or a proper party on the date of the offense.

   (3) Whether circumstances that could not be reasonably foreseen prevented the Respondent from attending the hearing.

   (4) Whether the Respondent had an emergency or condition requiring immediate medical attention.

   (5) Whether the matter had been previously adjourned by the Respondent.

   (6) Whether the Respondent attempted to attend the hearing with reasonable diligence.

   (7) Whether the Respondent's inability to attend the hearing was due to facts that were beyond the Respondent's control.

   (8) Whether the Respondent's failure to appear at the hearing can be attributed to the Respondent's failure to maintain current contact information on file with the applicable licensing agency.

   (9) Whether the Respondent has previously failed to appear in relation to the same summons.

   (10) Any other fact that the Tribunal considers to be relevant to the motion to vacate.

(e) If a motion to vacate a default has been previously granted, and a new default decision has been issued, a motion to vacate the second default decision in relation to the same summons will not be granted. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Chief Administrative Law Judge or his or her designee will have the discretion, in exceptional circumstances and in order to avoid injustice, to grant a request for a new hearing.

(f) Except as otherwise stated in 48 RCNY § 5-03, the Chief Administrative Law Judge or his or her designee will have the discretion, in exceptional circumstances and in order to avoid injustice, to consider a motion to vacate a default filed more than one (1) year from the date of the default decision.

(g) If a motion to vacate a default is granted, the Tribunal will send a notice to the Respondent at the Respondent's address provided on the motion. If the Respondent is deceased or legally incompetent, a notice will be sent to Respondent's representative at the address provided by the representative on the motion. Notice will also be sent to the Petitioner upon request. If the Respondent is unable to appear on the hearing date scheduled after such motion is granted, the Respondent may request that the hearing be rescheduled one final time.

(h) If a motion to vacate a default is granted and the Respondent has already made a full or partial payment, no request of a refund will be considered until after the hearing is completed and a decision issued.

(i) A denial of a motion to vacate a default is the Tribunal's final determination and is not subject to review or appeal at the Tribunal. Judicial review of the denial may be sought pursuant to Article 78 of the New York Civil Practice Law and Rules.









**Subchapter F: Miscellaneous**



*§ 6-22 Disqualification of Hearing Officers.* ::


(a) Grounds for Disqualification. A Hearing Officer will not preside over a hearing under the circumstances set forth in subdivisions (D) and (E) of § 103 of Appendix A of this title. When a Hearing Officer deems himself or herself disqualified to preside in a particular proceeding, the Hearing Officer will withdraw from the proceeding by notice on the record and will notify the Chief Administrative Law Judge or his or her designee of such withdrawal.

(b) Motion to Disqualify. A party may, for good cause shown, request that the Hearing Officer disqualify himself or herself. The Hearing Officer in the proceeding will rule on such motion.

   (1) If the Hearing Officer denies the motion, the party may obtain a brief adjournment in order to promptly apply for review by the Chief Administrative Law Judge or his or her designee.

   (2) If the Chief Administrative Law Judge or his or her designee determines that the Hearing Officer should be disqualified, the Chief Administrative Law Judge or his or her designee will appoint another Hearing Officer to continue the case. If a Hearing Officer's denial of the motion to disqualify is upheld by the Chief Administrative Law Judge or his or her designee, the party may raise the issue again on appeal.








*§ 6-23 Registered Representatives* ::


Requirements. A representative, other than a family member or an attorney admitted to practice in New York State, who represents two or more Respondents before the Tribunal within a calendar year must:

(a) Be at least eighteen (18) years of age;

(b) Register with the Tribunal by completing and submitting a form provided by the Tribunal. The form must include proof acceptable to the Tribunal that identifies the representative, and must also include any other information that the Tribunal may require. Registration must be renewed annually. Failure to register with the Tribunal may result in the Tribunal declining registration in the future;

(c) Notify the Tribunal within ten (10) business days of any change in the information required on the registration form;

(d) Not misrepresent his or her qualifications or service so as to mislead people into believing the representative is an attorney at law or a governmental employee if the representative is not. A representative who is not an attorney admitted to practice must refer to him or herself as "representative" when appearing before the Tribunal;

(e) Exercise due diligence in learning and observing Tribunal rules and preparing paperwork; and

(f) Be subject to discipline, including but not limited to suspension or revocation of the representative's right to appear before the Tribunal, for failing to follow the provisions of this subdivision and any other rules of the Tribunal. A list of representatives who have been suspended or barred from appearing may be made public.








*§ 6-24 Pre-hearing Notification of Schedule for Attorneys and Registered Representatives.* ::


(a) No attorney or registered representative may appear on fifteen (15) or more summonses on a given hearing date unless the attorney or registered representative emails or faxes in advance a written list of all scheduled cases to the Tribunal office in the borough where the cases are scheduled to be heard. This list must be sent no later than noon, two (2) business days before the scheduled hearing date.

(b) Cases may be added to this list on the day of the hearing at the discretion of the Tribunal.








*§ 6-25 Misconduct.* ::


(a) Prohibited Conduct. A party, witness, representative or attorney must not:

   (1) Engage in abusive, disorderly or delaying behavior, a breach of the peace or any other disturbance which directly or indirectly tends to disrupt, obstruct or interrupt the proceedings at the Tribunal;

   (2) Engage in any disruptive verbal conduct, action or gesture that a reasonable person would believe shows contempt or disrespect for the proceedings or that a reasonable person would believe to be intimidating;

   (3) Willfully disregard the authority of the Hearing Officer or other Tribunal employee. This may include refusing to comply with the Hearing Officer's directions or behaving in a disorderly, delaying or obstructionist manner;

   (4) Leave a hearing in progress without the permission of the Hearing Officer;

   (5) Attempt to influence or offer or agree to attempt to influence any Hearing Officer or employee of the Tribunal by the use of threats, accusations, duress or coercion, a promise of advantage, or the bestowing or offer of any gift, favor or thing of value;

   (6) Enter any area other than a public waiting area unless accompanied or authorized by a Tribunal employee. Upon conclusion of a hearing, a party, witness, representative or attorney must promptly exit non-public areas;

   (7) Request any Tribunal clerical staff to perform tasks that are illegal, unreasonable or outside the scope of the employee's job duties;

   (8) Operate any Tribunal computer terminal or other equipment at any time unless given express authorization or the equipment has been designated for use by the public;

   (9) Submit a document, or present testimony or other evidence to the Tribunal which he or she knows, or reasonably should have known, to be false, fraudulent or misleading;

   (10) Induce or encourage anyone to make a false statement to the Tribunal;

   (11) Solicit clients, or cause the solicitation of client by another person on Tribunal premises;

   (12) Make or cause to be made a stenographic, electronic, audio, audio-visual or other verbatim or photographic reproduction of any hearing or other proceeding, whether such hearing or other proceeding is conducted in person, by telephone, or other remote methods, except upon application to the Hearing Officer. This does not include copies of documents submitted to the Tribunal during a hearing including written or electronic statements and exhibits. Except as otherwise provided by law, such application must be addressed to the Hearing Officer, who may deny the application or grant it in full, in part, or upon such conditions as the Hearing Officer deems necessary to preserve the decorum of the proceedings and to protect the interests of the parties, witnesses and any other concerned persons.

(b) Prohibited Communication.

   (1) All parties must be present when communications with Tribunal personnel, including a Hearing Officer, occur, except as necessary for case processing and unless otherwise permitted by these rules, on consent or in an emergency.

   (2) All persons are prohibited from initiating communication with a Hearing Officer or other employee before or after a hearing or before or after a decision on motion, in order to attempt to influence the outcome of a hearing or decision on motion.

(c) Penalties for Misconduct.

   (1) Failure to abide by these rules constitutes misconduct. The Chief Administrative Law Judge or his or her designee may, for good cause, suspend or bar from appearing before the Tribunal an attorney or representative who fails to abide by these rules. The suspension may be either for a specified period of time or indefinitely until the attorney or representative demonstrates to the satisfaction of the Chief Administrative Law Judge or his or her designee that the basis for the suspension no longer exists.

   (2) However, the Chief Administrative Law Judge or his or her designee may not act until after the attorney or representative is given notice and a reasonable opportunity to appear before the Chief Administrative Law Judge or his or her designee to rebut the claims against him or her. The Chief Administrative Law Judge or his or her designee, depending upon the nature of the conduct, will determine whether said appearance will be in person or by a remote method.

   This section in no way limits the powers of a Hearing Officer as set out in 48 RCNY § 6-13.

(d) Discipline on Other Grounds.

   (1) Notwithstanding the provisions of subdivision (c) of this section, the Chief Administrative Law Judge may summarily suspend or bar a representative upon a determination that the representative lacks honesty and integrity and that the lack of honesty and integrity will adversely affect his or her practice before the Tribunal.

   (2) Any action pursuant to this subdivision will be on notice to the representative. After the summary suspension or bar, the representative will be given an opportunity to be heard in a proceeding prescribed by the Chief Administrative Law Judge or his or her designee. Factors to be considered in determining whether a representative lacks honesty and integrity include, but are not limited to, considering whether the representative has made false, misleading or inappropriate statements to parties or Tribunal staff.

(e) Judicial Review. The decision of the Chief Administrative Law Judge or his or her designee under subdivision (c) or (d) of this section constitutes a final determination. Judicial review of the decision may be sought pursuant to Article 78 of the New York Civil Practice Law and Rules.








*§ 6-26 Request for a New Hearing Due to Unauthorized Representation.* ::


Notwithstanding any other provision of these rules, a party may, within three (3) years after a decision pursuant to a hearing has become final, move to vacate the decision on the grounds that the person who appeared on the party's behalf at the hearing was not authorized to do so. Upon a determination that the person who appeared was not authorized to represent the party, the Tribunal may vacate the decision and schedule a new hearing. In exceptional circumstances and in order to avoid injustice, the Tribunal will have the discretion to grant a motion to vacate a decision after the three (3) year period has lapsed.








*§ 6-27 Defense Based on Sovereign or Diplomatic Immunity.* ::


(a) A Respondent may present a defense based on sovereign or diplomatic immunity:

   (1) in a written submission received no later than seven (7) business days before the hearing date stated on the summons, in which the Respondent may admit or deny the violation charged and the Tribunal will assign the matter to a Hearing Officer; or

   (2) at a hearing orally or in writing, but only if an attorney or authorized representative of the Petitioner is present at the hearing or if the Respondent at that time consents to an adjournment of the hearing; or

   (3) in a response submitted in any case in which adjudication by remote method is allowed pursuant to 48 RCNY § 6-10.

(b) Upon presentation of a defense based on sovereign or diplomatic immunity, the Hearing Officer must issue an order:

   (1) adjourning the hearing for no less than thirty (30) and no more than sixty (60) days;

   (2) setting forth in detail the violations alleged in the summons; and

   (3) giving notice to the City entity charged with serving as the official liaison with foreign governments ("liaison") that the Respondent has presented a defense based on sovereign or diplomatic immunity, in which event the Tribunal will promptly serve such order to such liaison.

(c) After an adjournment is granted under subdivision (b), either party may request to extend the time period of the adjournment. The Hearing Officer must grant such request if it is accompanied by a written submission from the liaison indicating more time is necessary for the parties to resolve the matter.

(d) (1) At a hearing held following an adjournment granted pursuant to subdivision (b), the Hearing Officer must issue a determination whether or not the Respondent is entitled to sovereign or diplomatic immunity.

   (2) If the Hearing Officer determines that the Respondent is entitled to sovereign or diplomatic immunity, he or she must dismiss the summons without a determination of the Respondent's liability.

   (3) If the Hearing Officer rejects the defense of sovereign or diplomatic immunity, a hearing on the violation must be conducted pursuant to the rules governing hearings in this Chapter.








*§ 6-28 Application to File a Post-Hearing Agreement.* ::


A written application to file a post-hearing agreement must be made jointly and with the consent of all the parties to a matter. Such applications must be made to the designated Deputy Commissioner of OATH, or his or her designee as approved by the Chief Administrative Law Judge. The post-hearing agreement will not amend the Hearing Officer's final written decision and when filed, will become part of the record.

(b) A Respondent is eligible for Community Service if the Respondent appears in person before a Hearing Officer and admits to a Specified Violation alleged in a summons, or if the Specified Violation is sustained at a hearing. Respondent need not opt for community service at the time of the hearing.

(c) A Respondent is not eligible for Community Service if the Specified Violation arose during the conduct of commercial activity or activity carried out for a commercial purpose, except when the commercial activity alleged is a violation of Administrative Code Section 18-146(c)(15).








*§ 7-03 Choosing Community Service.* ::


(a) A Respondent eligible for Community Service as set forth in 48 RCNY § 7-02 will receive a Decision that gives Respondent the option either to complete Community Service by a specified date or to pay the applicable monetary civil penalty. If the Respondent wants to perform Community Service, the Respondent must contact the Community Service Provider to schedule Community Service.

(b) If the Respondent fails to complete the Community Service as set forth in 48 RCNY §§ 7-04 and 7-05, the applicable monetary civil penalty will be reinstated. The monetary civil penalty will be due and owing thirty (30) days from the date of the Decision, or thirty-five (35) days if the Decision is mailed.








*§ 7-04 Amount of Community Service in Place of a Monetary Civil Penalty.* ::


The number of hours of Community Service imposed will correspond to the amount of the monetary civil penalty imposed for a Specified Violation, consistent with New York City Charter Section 1049(4)(e). The number of hours of Community Service for each Specified Violation is in the chart set forth in 48 RCNY § 7-02(a).








*§ 7-05 Completion of Community Service.* ::


(a) A Respondent must complete the Community Service assigned by the Community Service Provider.

(b) A Respondent must complete the Community Service by the date specified in the Decision, unless otherwise specified in a notice granting an extension, or an order issued, pursuant to 48 RCNY § 7-07.

(c) A Respondent may request an extension of time to complete the Community Service through the Community Service Provider prior to the deadline to complete the Community Service specified in the Decision.

   (1) The Community Service Provider may grant a request for an extension for good cause shown. In determining whether there is good cause for an extension, the Community Service Provider will consider factors such as the following:

      (A) The length of extension requested;

      (B) The number of hours of Community Service to be completed and the amount of the monetary civil penalty that would be due;

      (C) The number of prior extensions requested;

      (D) Whether the need for the extension is due to factors beyond Respondent’s control or due to extraordinary circumstances; and

      (E) Whether a portion of the Community Service has been completed.

   (2) A denial of a request for an extension is not subject to appeal.

   (3)  A request for extension of time to complete Community Service will not extend the date by which a Respondent must pay the monetary civil penalty. If a request for an extension is denied, the Respondent must either complete the Community Service by the date specified in the Decision, or pay the applicable monetary civil penalty thirty (30) days from the date of the Decision or thirty-five (35) days if the Decision is mailed.

(d) Within two (2) days after the specified date of completion in a Decision, a notice granting an extension, or an order issued, pursuant to 48 RCNY § 7-07, the Community Service Provider must provide to Respondent either:

   (1) a Certificate of Completion indicating that the Community Service was completed by the specified date; or

   (2) a Certificate of Non-Completion indicating that the Community Service was not completed by the specified date.

(e) If a Respondent who receives a Certificate of Non-Completion believes that he or she has timely completed Community Service, he or she may contact OATH’s Clerk’s Office. The Clerk’s Office will review any information or documentation submitted in support of Respondent’s claim that Community Service was completed on time. If the Clerk’s Office finds that Community Service was completed on time, Respondent will not have to pay the monetary civil penalty.








*§ 7-06 Respondent Appeal of a Decision After Requesting Community Service.* ::


(a) If a Respondent who has chosen to perform Community Service instead of paying a monetary civil penalty timely appeals the Decision sustaining the Specified Violation, pursuant to 48 RCNY § 6-19, the part of the Decision ordering completion of Community Service will be stayed until a decision on the appeal is issued. A Respondent will not be required to complete the Community Service or pay the applicable monetary civil penalty in order to file an appeal.

(b) If a Respondent’s appeal is denied, the Respondent must either complete the Community Service within twenty (20) days of the date of the appeal decision, or pay the monetary civil penalty, unless otherwise specified in a notice granting an extension.








*§ 7-07 Choosing Community Service After a Specified Violation is Sustained on Agency’s Appeal.* ::


(a) If a decision on an appeal sustains a Specified Violation, reversing a Hearing Officer’s Decision to dismiss that violation, a Respondent may choose to perform Community Service instead of paying the monetary civil penalty. Within ten (10) days of the date of the appeal decision, the Respondent must inform OATH of his or her decision to perform Community Service by filing a request, on a form provided by OATH, with the Clerk’s Office. If the Respondent fails to do so within ten (10) days of the date of the decision on the appeal, the monetary civil penalty will be due and owing immediately.

(b) If the Respondent chooses to perform community service, Respondent will receive an order granting a timely request and imposing a deadline to complete the Community Service. The monetary civil penalty will be due and owing if the Respondent fails to perform the Community Service by the deadline in the order.
