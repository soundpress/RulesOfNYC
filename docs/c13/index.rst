(a) In addition to the general requirements for construction and design of mobile food vending units and their equipment in 24 RCNY § 6-04, and the location sharing device required by 24 RCNY § 6-21, each class of vending units shall be supplied and equipped in accordance with Table 1 of this section. The minimum equipment required is determined by the class of the unit and the foods that are processed and/or sold on the unit.

(b) Permit subject to revocation; mobile food vending units subject to seizure. Persons who prepare, process or serve foods from a mobile food vending unit that is not equipped in accordance with the requirements specified for the unit's permit classification as set forth in this section will be deemed to be vending without a permit.

In accordance with § 17-320 (a) of the Administrative Code, the Commissioner may exempt any area within the control of a government agency or charitable organization from provisions of Title 17 of the Administrative Code that limit the total number of full-term or temporary mobile food vending permits that may be issued, or the number of permits that may be issued to any one person. The Commissioner may make this exemption provided that (i) the request for issuance is made in writing by the agency or organization and (ii) permittees comply with all other applicable provisions, limitations and conditions imposed by the New York City Administrative Code, the Health Code, the State Sanitary Code and these rules.






*§ 6-15 Modification.* ::


When the strict applicability of any provision of this Chapter presents practical difficulties or unusual or unreasonable hardships, the Department, in a specific instance, may modify the application of such provision consistent with the general purpose of this Chapter and upon such conditions as are deemed necessary.






*§ 6-16 Scoring mobile food vending unit inspections.* ::


The Department shall, when conducting a sanitary inspection, assess points only for those violations, violation conditions and condition levels listed in Appendix 6-A (Self-Inspection Worksheet for Mobile Food Vending Units (MFVU)) and Appendix 6-B (Mobile Food Vending Unit (MFVU) Inspection Scoring Parameters: A Guide to Conditions) to this Chapter. Terms used in these appendices and not otherwise defined in this Chapter shall have the same meaning as defined in 24 RCNY Health Code Articles 81 and 89 of the Health Code.








*§ 6-17 Letter grading.* ::


(a) The Department, whenever practicable, shall conduct an inspection at least annually of each mobile food vending unit for the purpose of issuing such unit a letter grade. Based on the results of either the initial inspection or reinspection within an inspection cycle, a mobile food vending unit shall be graded as either “A", “B", or “C” for that inspection cycle, except that a unit shall not receive any grade if the Department orders that it be closed.

(b) The Department shall issue a letter grade of “A” to any unit that receives fewer than 14 points on either the initial inspection or reinspection within an inspection cycle.

(c) The Department shall not issue a letter grade to any mobile food vending unit receiving 14 or more points on an initial inspection but shall schedule a reinspection to occur no sooner than seven days after the initial inspection. The Department shall on the reinspection issue a grade of “B” to any unit receiving 14 - 27 points and a letter grade of “C” to any unit receiving 28 or more points.

(d) In addition to conducting an initial and any reinspection for the purpose of issuing a unit a letter grade, the Department may, in any inspection cycle, also conduct a compliance inspection after any inspection that results in a score of 28 points or more. The score received on any compliance inspection shall not change a unit’s letter grade for that inspection cycle.








*§ 6-18 Intervals between inspection cycles.* ::


(a) The time between a completed cycle and the initial inspection in the next inspection cycle for a unit that receives 14 or more points on its initial inspection shall be determined by the higher score from either its initial inspection or its reinspection.

   (1) An initial inspection commencing a new cycle shall be conducted approximately one year after issuance of an “A” grade to a unit that received less than 14 points on its initial inspection in the previous cycle.

   (2) An initial inspection commencing a new inspection cycle shall be conducted 150 - 210 days after the reinspection of any unit that receives a score of 14 - 27 points on an initial inspection or reinspection and does not score 28 or more points on either of these inspections.

   (3) An initial inspection commencing a new inspection cycle shall be conducted 90 to 150 days after the final inspection of the cycle of a unit that receives a score of 28 or more points on its initial inspection or reinspection.

   (4) An initial inspection commencing a new inspection cycle shall be conducted within 60 to 120 days of reopening for a unit that is authorized by the Department to reopen following a Department closure that occurs on an initial or reinspection of that unit.

(b) When there is an increased risk to public health as determined by the Department, nothing in these rules shall prevent the Department from inspecting a unit and treating that inspection as the initial inspection in a new inspection cycle. Such circumstances include, but are not limited to, a unit having a history of Department closure(s), being the subject of complaints of unsanitary conditions, or being compromised following an environmental emergency.

(c) Notwithstanding the provisions of this section, a new inspection cycle shall commence whenever:

   (1) A mobile food vending unit changes from a pushcart to a vehicle or from a vehicle to a pushcart, as such terms are defined in 24 RCNY Health Code Article 89.

   (2) A new decal is issued because there has been a change in the permit classification as described in 24 RCNY §  6-03.








*§ 6-19 Posting letter grades.* ::


A mobile food vending unit must have a letter grade posted at all times, as required by these rules.

(a) The Department shall at the time of inspection issue and post a letter grade “A” on a unit that receives a score of less than 14 points on an initial or reinspection.

(b) If a mobile food vending unit receives a score of 14 or more points on an initial inspection, and is not closed by the Department, it shall continue to post its grade from the prior inspection cycle until its reinspection. If the unit has been issued no prior grade card, it shall have no posting until its reinspection.

(c) If a mobile food vending unit receives a score of 14 or more points on the reinspection, and is not closed by the Department, the Department shall post on the unit a “grade pending” card. If the permit-holder elects to have the grade of “B” or “C” earned at the reinspection posted to the unit instead of a “grade pending” card, the permit-holder may contact the Department to arrange for the unit to be brought to a place designated by the Department so the Department may post the preliminary grade.

(d) Grading after adjudication of summonses. Where a unit scores 14 or more points on a reinspection and was issued one or more summons for findings made at that inspection, the following shall apply:

   (1) Except as described in paragraph (2) of this subdivision, within 42 days of the reinspection date that generated the summons, the permit-holder shall contact the Department to arrange for the posting of the final letter grade for that inspection cycle.

Non-chemical water treatment devices that employ alternative technologies to control biological growth may not be used in lieu of chemical biocide unless approved by the Department. Nonchemical water treatment devices may be installed as part of a cooling tower system as specified in the management program and plan, provided that the required chemical water treatment also being used adequately controls for Legionella.

(e) Makeup water. Owners using water derived from rainwater capture or recycling water systems as a source of cooling tower system makeup water must install a drift eliminator and test and treat water in accordance with a specific alternative source water plan. This plan is in addition to the maintenance program and plan required by 24 RCNY § 8-03, and must be approved by the Department. The alternative water source plan must include provisions for adequate design of the treatment and control components and on-going evaluation to eliminate any risk to public health.

(f) Water quality monitoring.

   (1) Frequency. Water quality parameters, including but not limited to pH, temperature, conductivity and biocidal indicators, must be measured and recorded as specified in the management program and plan as follows:

      (B) Continuous, automated and/or remote measurements. When continuous, automated and/or remote measurements and recordings are used, the management program and plan must show how effective measurements of system process control are being monitored. Automated measurements must be properly recorded and results made immediately available to responsible and qualified persons and to Department inspectors when requested.

   (2) Minimum weekly biological process control indicators. A bacteriological indicator to estimate microbial content of recirculating water must be collected and interpreted in accordance with Table 8-2 at least once each week while the cooling tower system is operating. Indicators must be taken at times and from water sampling points, as detailed in the maintenance program and plan, that will be representative of water microbial content. Indicators may be taken at any time from constant chemical treatment systems. Indicators from systems that use intermittent biocide applications must be taken before biocide application and reflect normal cooling tower operating conditions.

   (3) Legionella samples.Legionella culture testing must be conducted no less frequently than every 90 days during cooling tower system operation. A Legionella sample must be analyzed by a U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ELITE Program certified laboratory, by the New York State Department of Health Wadsworth Center or other laboratory approved by the Department. Test results of all Legionella species at or above the magnitude of level 4 as indicated in Table 8-1 must be reported to the Department within 24 hours of receiving the test results. Additional emergency Legionella sampling must be conducted if any of the following occur:

      (A) Power failure of sufficient duration to allow for growth of bacteria;

      (B) Loss of biocide treatment sufficient to allow for growth of bacteria;

      (C) Failure of conductivity controls to maintain proper cycles of concentration;

Chapter 16: Criteria For Issuing Special Vehicle Identification Permits To Disabled Persons
--------------------------------------------------



*§ 16-01 Introduction.* ::


This rule establishes criteria for the issuing of Special Vehicle Identification Parking Permits (SVIPP), also known as Parking Permits for People with Disabilities (PPPD), pursuant to § 2903(a)(15)(a) of the New York City Charter, to or on behalf of disabled persons who have a permanent disability seriously impairing mobility and authorizes the use of physicians designated by the Department, including New York City Health &amp; Hospitals Corporation employed physicians so designated pursuant to a contract entered into by the Department with the Health &amp; Hospitals Corporation and the Department of Transportation, to make the decisions as to the eligibility of such persons for these special permits.






*§ 16-02 Permanent Disabilities Seriously Impairing Mobility.* ::


For the purposes of § 2903(a)(15)(a) of the New York City Charter the following conditions constitute permanent disabilities that seriously impair mobility:

(a) Complete monoplegia or paraplegia of lower extremities.

(b) Above ankle amputation of lower extremities, at the discretion of the examining physician. Well-fitted below the knee prosthesis with normal ambulatory gait should not routinely be regarded as mobility impaired.

(c) Arthritis of two major weight bearing joints of the lower extremities with clearly substantial X-rays changes and/or MRI changes, such as loss of joint space, severe degenerative changes plus one or more of the following:

   (1) Objective finding of sizable effusion of joint(s) detected by clinical examination

   (2) Gross instability or valgus/varus deformities of joint(s) detected by clinical examination

   (3) Ankylosis or contracture of major joint(s) to such a degree as to preclude stair climbing. Joint replacement does not qualify by itself unless accompanied by one or more of the above criteria.

(d) Severe atrophy of one or both lower extremities (or discrepancy in leg lengths greater than three inches) which clearly and seriously impairs mobility.

(e) Spinal column abnormalities of severe degree with unequivocal motor involvement not amenable to bracing or surgery which would seriously and permanently impair mobility. X-ray evidence of arthritis of the spine with or without pain is insufficient reason for approval. CT Scan, MRI and/or EMG results must be available for review prior to a decision.

(f) Neurological conditions, such as multiple sclerosis, myasthenia gravis, myopathies, Parkinsonism and Alzheimer's Disease, affecting both lower extremities that would seriously impair mobility. Objective documentation (i.e., MRI, EMG, nerve conduction studies, et al.) must be submitted, where appropriate, by the applicant.

(g) Cardiovascular and peripheral vascular disease of severe degree resulting in mobility impairment. Cardiovascular disease must meet ADA Class III or IV criteria; stress test, echocardiogram, Doppler or other diagnostic studies must support evidence of significant pathology and/or disability.

(h) Pulmonary disease with documented evidence of severe obstructive or restrictive disease on pulmonary function testing. Evidence of use of supplemental oxygen for more than twelve hours per day may also be acceptable evidence of impairment.

(i) Renal insufficiency requiring frequent renal dialysis with significant objective finding of neural or hemic abnormalities.

(j) Malignancies of any category that require chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy or other medical interventions which continuously and seriously impair mobility.

(k) Post-Polio syndrome that on examination clearly and seriously impairs mobility.

(l) AIDS related conditions, including peripheral neuropathy, wasting syndrome, dementia, which clearly seriously impair mobility on physical examination.

(m) Mental conditions resulting in mental retardation of a severe nature documented by appropriate psychological evaluation, which permanently and seriously impair mobility.

(n) Congenital diseases of any type that clearly result in permanent serious mobility impairment, including cerebral palsy, spina bifida and Down syndrome.

(o) Any other permanent disability that in the specific circumstances, would seriously impair the mobility of the applicant.






*§ 16-03 Physicians Employed by Health &amp; Hospitals Corporation Designated to Perform Special Vehicle Identification Parking Permit Certifications.* ::


The Department may use physicians, made available for this purpose by the Health &amp; Hospitals Corporation pursuant to a contract entered into by the Department with the Health &amp; Hospitals Corporation and the Department of Transportation, to perform medical certifications of Special Vehicle Identification Parking Permit applications submitted to the Department of Transportation. Such physicians, employed by the Health &amp; Hospitals Corporation, shall be qualified to certify persons for a Special Vehicle Identification Parking Permit as possessing a "permanent disability seriously impairing mobility" in accordance with § 2903(15)(a) of the Charter and the criteria specified in 24 RCNY § 16-02 above. A practitioner in an appropriate field of specialization may be used to perform a medical certification when deemed necessary by the non-specialist/physician assessing the person's medical eligibility for a SVIPP.






*§ 16-04 Certification.* ::


(a)  Certification Form. The Physician Certification Form shall state that, after a review of the SVIPP application and any accompanying documentation furnished by the applicant's personal physician, it has been determined that the applicant does or does not have a "permanent disability seriously impairing mobility". Where certification has been denied, the Form shall indicate whether that determination was based upon the fact that the medical documentation presented does not support a finding of a "permanent disability seriously impairing mobility" or because the clinical findings are inconsistent with the applicant's medical history or otherwise does not support the finding of a "permanent disability seriously impairing mobility". Except as otherwise provided in 24 RCNY § 16-05, such determination shall be final when it is adopted by the Department.

(b) Post-Certification Reevaluation. In certain cases where certification has been granted, an applicant may be required to submit, at some future time designated by the physician/provider at the time of certification, to a reevaluation/reassessment of his (her) medical condition in order to determine whether the applicant continues to have a "permanent disability seriously impairing mobility". The decision to require a reevaluation of the applicant shall not be subject to appeal pursuant to 24 RCNY § 16-05.






*§ 16-05 Appeals.* ::


Where certification has been denied, an applicant for a Special Vehicle Identification Parking Permit may appeal such determination. Such request for appeal must be made within thirty business days of service of the decision denying the certification upon the applicant on a form received with the decision. Where the denial of certification was based upon a determination/finding that the medical history of the person does not support a finding of a "permanent disability seriously impairing mobility", the Department shall provide for a review of the file by a physician other than the physician who denied such certification. Where such denial was based upon clinical findings, or where the clinical findings were inconsistent with the medical history of the person, the Department shall provide a second assessment, which may include a physical examination by a physician selected by the Department other than the physician who denied certification. The applicant/appellant shall not be precluded from engaging an outside medical expert or specialist for purposes of his or her appeal. The results of any examination performed by such specialist and his or her conclusions shall be made part of the appeal record. The Department, or provider designated by the Department, may also provide a second assessment by a specialist when deemed necessary by the physician/provider. The results of the examination by this specialist shall also be made part of the appeal record. The determination of such appeal shall be final when it is adopted by the Department. A final determination denying certification shall preclude the filing of a Special Vehicle Identification Parking Permit application for the same condition by or on behalf of such person unless such person demonstrates that the condition has significantly worsened.

*§ 19-02 Direction to Establish Waiting Lists.* ::


The Department shall establish separate waiting lists for full-term and temporary mobile food unit permits as well as four additional separate waiting lists for full-term permits that are designated exclusively for use in the boroughs of the Bronx, Brooklyn, Queens and Staten Island. The waiting lists shall consist of the names of natural persons, corporations, partnerships or limited liability companies authorized to hold a permit, who are selected for placement on these waiting lists in accordance with these rules. Any listing purporting to be a waiting list for mobile food unit permits, except for a listing authorized by Local Law 34 of 1993, in existence prior to the effective date of this rule shall be deemed void and of no force or effect.






*§ 19-03 Eligibility for Place on Waiting Lists.* ::


To be eligible for a position on any of the waiting lists established pursuant to these rules, a person (or in the case of a corporation, partnership or limited liability company, an officer, member, manager or partner thereof authorized to act for such person) shall hold a valid mobile food vendor license at least ten days prior to the date that the Department establishes such waiting lists.






*§ 19-04 Notice of the Establishment of Waiting Lists.* ::


At least 45 days prior to the establishment of waiting lists notice of the Department's intention to establish such waiting lists shall be published in the City Record. Such notice shall also be mailed to persons holding mobile food vendor licenses at the time of such publication, as well as to other interested parties known to the Department. Such Notice shall advise that only those persons in possession of valid mobile food vendor licenses at least ten days prior to the establishment of such waiting lists shall be eligible for inclusion on any such waiting list.






*§ 19-05 Procedure for Requesting a Place on Any of the Waiting Lists.* ::


The Division of Permits shall use a mail-in procedure for establishing all waiting lists. Such procedure shall allow persons requesting a place on any of the six waiting lists to submit a waiting list application, which shall contain their license number and the type of permit they seek, by mail postmarked during a period of time to be determined by the Division of Permits, which shall be specified in the Notice published pursuant to 24 RCNY § 19-04. A person's eligibility for inclusion on the waiting lists authorized to be created pursuant to these rules shall be limited. Persons shall be eligible for inclusion on the full-term waiting list, the temporary permit waiting list and one borough-specific full-term permit waiting list of the applicant's choice at any one time. Pursuant to § 17-307(b)(2)(c) a person shall be issued no more than one permit, whether full-term, borough-specific full-term, or temporary.






*§ 19-06 Procedure for Establishment of Permit Waiting Lists.* ::


Not less than 45 days after the Notice required by 24 RCNY § 19-04 is published in the City Record, the Department shall create a full-term permit waiting list, a temporary permit waiting list and four separate borough-specific full-term permit waiting lists pursuant to a random selection procedure. Persons holding valid mobile food vendor licenses, or in the case of a corporation, limited liability company or partnership, persons on whose behalf such licenses are held on the date such lists are created and who have mailed in an application pursuant to 24 RCNY § 19-05 shall be included in this random selection. Persons who, as a result of this random selection procedure, hold position numbers greater than the maximum number specified in 24 RCNY § 19-07 for the particular list shall not be placed on that waiting list. The Department shall notify persons assigned a position on a waiting list by mailing a notice to the address provided by the applicant in such applicant's waiting list application.






*§ 19-07 Number of Positions on the Waiting Lists.* ::


The maximum number of positions on the full-term permit waiting list shall be determined by the Department's Permits Division so as to provide a reasonable number of potential applicants to fill vacancies as they arise, but in no event shall such list exceed two thousand five hundred (2,500) positions. The maximum number of positions on the temporary permit waiting list shall be determined by the Department's Permits Division so as to provide a reasonable number of potential applicants to fill vacancies as they arise, but in no event shall such waiting list exceed one thousand (1000) positions. When the number of potential applicants on either the full-term or temporary permit waiting lists falls below two hundred (200), the Permits Division shall supplement such waiting lists with additional names pursuant to the procedure specified in 24 RCNY §§ 19-03 through 19-05. The maximum number of positions on each of the four waiting lists for full-term permits to be used exclusively for vending in the specified boroughs of the Bronx, Brooklyn, Queens and Staten Island shall also be determined by the Department's Permits Division so as to provide a reasonable number of potential applicants to fill future vacancies as they arise. In no event shall any of these borough-specific permit waiting lists exceed one hundred (100) positions or four hundred (400) for all borough-specific list positions combined. When the number of potential applicants on any of the borough-specific permit waiting lists falls below twenty-five (25), the Permits Division shall seek to supplement such waiting list with additional names pursuant to the procedure specified in 24 RCNY §§ 19-03 through 19-05.






*§ 19-08 Responsibility of Those on Waiting Lists to Notify the Department of Change of Address.* ::


The names of persons selected for a waiting list created pursuant to these rules shall be entered on each list with their address of record as known to the Department through mobile food vendor license records, in the case of a corporation, partnership or limited liability company, the address of such corporation, partnership or limited liability company and the residence and business address of the officer, partner, manager, or member holding a mobile food vendor license who is authorized to act on behalf of such corporation, partnership, or limited liability company shall be entered. Thereafter, it shall be the responsibility of each person placed on a waiting list to provide written notification to the Department of any change of address. The Department shall provide written confirmation of its receipt of such address change notification. The failure to provide change of address information may result in the loss of a person's waiting list position(s). Any person who does not respond to any notice of the Department mailed to his or her address of record as known to the Department through mobile food vendor license records because change of address information was not provided to the Department in a timely manner shall be deemed to have abandoned his or her place on a waiting list and shall not be reinstated to any list unless such person participates in a process of list establishment pursuant to 24 RCNY §§ 19-03 through 19-06. The Department's written confirmation of its receipt of a change of address notification shall constitute proof that such notification was provided to the Department.






*§ 19-09 Multiple Waiting List Positions on Any Single List Prohibited.* ::


A person may submit waiting list applications for positions on the following specific lists: the full-term permit waiting list, the temporary permit waiting list and one of the four borough-specific permit waiting lists that are to be created pursuant to these rules. A person may not, under any circumstances, occupy more than one waiting list position on any of the three waiting lists selected by the applicant and no person shall be eligible to obtain more than one permit. Before the creation of any of these lists through the random selection process, the Department shall ensure that a mobile food vendor licensee is represented only once in the pool of licensees from which the random listing or selection to each list is made. For purposes of the waiting lists only, officers, members, managers and partners who represent corporations, limited liability companies and partnerships that are current mobile food unit permit holders shall not be excluded from the pool from which the randomized waiting lists are to be created solely on the basis that such officer, member, manager or partner is a licensee acting on behalf of a corporation, limited liability company or partnership, provided each such individual possesses a valid mobile food vendor license in accordance with these rules. Such officers, members, managers and partners, will be deemed to be representing themselves as individuals, and not the corporation, limited liability company or partnership with which they are associated, when placed on any waiting list, and shall be placed on any such waiting list in their individual capacities. Where such individual is acting on behalf of a corporation, limited liability company or partnership, the name of the corporation, limited liability company or partnership shall be placed on a waiting list with the name of the individual who is acting on its behalf. No partner, member or manager of a limited liability company or director, shareholder or officer of a corporation shall appear on the same waiting list as the partnership, limited liability company or corporation which he or she represents and/or has an interest in unless he or she holds the waiting list position in his or her individual capacity. Should the Department receive more than one request for a waiting list position from any person, requests subsequent to the first shall be deemed invalid. A person who submits more than one request for a position on any single waiting list will be disqualified and denied a position on the list if such multiple requests are deemed, in the sole discretion of the Department, to adversely affect the fairness or orderly establishment of a list.

Chapter 20: Preference And/or Waiting List Rule For Full-term Mobile Food Unit Permits
--------------------------------------------------



*§ 20-01 Definitions.* ::


(a)  Words and terms used in this rule shall have the meanings specified in § 17-306 of the Administrative Code.

(b) "Establishment", "establish" or "established" shall refere to the initial creation of the preference and/or waiting list required by § 17-307(b)(3) as well as all subsequent supplementations and re-establishments of such list as necessary for filling both vacancies to the list and waiting list positions for these permits.






*§ 20-02 Direction to Establish Preference and/or Waiting Lists.* ::


The Department shall establish, as required, separate preference and/or waiting lists for full-term mobile food unit permits for the preference categories specified in § 17-307(b)(3)(b) of the Administrative Code. With regard to the first preference category specified in § 17-307(b)(3)(i), the Department may create an alternative waiting list based upon a random selection of one-hundred (100) candidates from the defined class of disabled veterans formerly holding general vendor licenses.






*§ 20-03 Eligibility for Place on Preference and/or Waiting Lists.* ::


To be eligible for inclusion on a preference and/or waiting list established pursuant to this rule an applicant must be a natural person holding a valid mobile food vendor license at least ten days prior to the date that the Department establishes such list. In addition, he or she must belong to a preference category established by § 17-307(b)(3), must not already hold a full-term mobile food unit permit and/or have had such a permit previously revoked or suspended.






*§ 20-04 Notice of the Establishment of Preference and/or Waiting Lists.* ::


Notice of the Department's establishment of a preference and/or waiting list, shall be made by publication in the City Record specifying the preference category for which such list is being established, at least forty-five days prior to the establishment of the waiting list, and by mail, also at least forty-five days prior to the establishment of the list, to all eligible persons holding mobile food vendor licenses, as well as other interested parties known to the Department, including persons known to the Department who are in superior preference categories. Such notice shall advise that only those natural persons in possession of valid mobile food vendor licenses at least ten days prior to the establishment of a preference and/or waiting list shall be eligible for inclusion on such list.






*§ 20-05 Procedure for Requesting a Place on a Preference and/or Waiting List.* ::


The Division of Permits shall use a mail-in procedure for establishing preference and/or waiting lists. Such procedure shall allow persons requesting a place on a preference and/or waiting list to submit a preference and/or waiting list application. Each such application shall contain the applicant's license number and preference category. The application shall be submitted by mail, postmarked during a period of time to be determined by the Division of Permits as specified in the notice published pursuant to 24 RCNY § 20-04 above.






*§ 20-06 Procedure for Establishment of Preference and/or Waiting List.* ::


Not less than forty-five days after the Notice required by 24 RCNY § 20-04 is published in the City Record, the Department shall create a preference and/or waiting list pursuant to a random selection procedure. Persons holding valid mobile food vendor licenses at least ten days prior to the date such preference and/or waiting list is created and who have mailed in an application pursuant to 24 RCNY § 20-05 shall be included in the random selection. Persons who, as a result of this random selection procedure, hold position numbers greater than the maximum number specified in 24 RCNY § 20-07 shall not be placed on the preference and/or waiting list. Each qualified applicant for a preference and/or waiting list position shall be eligible for one permit and one position on the preference and/or waiting list. The person's position on a preference and/or waiting list shall be determined by his or her preference category and the order in which his or her name is randomly selected within such preference category. The Department shall notify persons assigned a position on the preference and/or waiting list by mailing a notice to the address provided by the applicant in the applicant's preference and/or waiting list application.






*§ 20-07 Number of Positions on a Preference and/or Waiting List.* ::


The maximum number of positions on a preference and/or waiting list shall be determined by the Department's Permit Division so as to provide a reasonable number of potential applicants for the permits currently available as well as to fill future vacancies as they arise. In no event shall a preference and/or waiting list exceed one hundred (100) positions. After the initial issuance of the one hundred permits authorized by § 17-307(b)(3), the Permits Division may supplement a preference and/or waiting list with additional names pursuant to the procedures specified in 24 RCNY §§ 20-04 through 20-06. Prior to supplementing a preference and/or waiting list by giving notice and an opportunity to apply for a waiting list position to a particular preference group, in accordance with the procedures outlined in 24 RCNY §§ 20-04 through 20-06, the Permits Division shall first notify and solicit applications for a preference and/or waiting list from all persons known to the Department who are in all superior preference categories. Those in a superior preference category will be given priority over those in a lower preference category in the filling of any vacancy.






*§ 20-08 Responsibility of Those on Preference and/or Waiting List to Notify the Department of Change of Address.* ::


The names of persons selected for a position on a preference and/or waiting list created pursuant to these rules shall be entered on this list with their address of record as known to the Department through mobile food vendor license records. Thereafter, it shall be the responsibility of each person placed on a preference and/or waiting list to provide written notification to the Department of any change of address. The Department shall provide written confirmation of its receipt of such address change notification. The failure to provide change of address information or, when requested, proof of the Department's confirmation of receipt of such written notification, may result in the loss of a person's preference and/or waiting list position and such person's eligibility to apply for a mobile food unit permit issued pursuant to § 17-307(b)(3) of the Administrative Code. Such person shall be deemed to have abandoned his or her place on the preference and/or waiting list and will not be reinstated to the list unless such person participates in the process of list establishment pursuant to 24 RCNY §§ 20-03 through 20-06. The Department's written confirmation of its receipt of a change of address notification shall constitute proof that such notification was provided to the Department.






*§ 20-09 Multiple Requests for Preference and/or Waiting List Position Prohibited.* ::


No more than one preference and/or waiting list position shall be granted to any person, who shall be eligible to obtain only one permit. Before the creation of the preference and/or waiting list through the random selection process, the Department shall ensure that a mobile food vendor licensee is represented only once in the pool of licensees from which the random listing and selection is to be made. Should the Department receive more than one request from any person, requests subsequent to the first shall be deemed invalid. A person who submits more than one request for a position on the preference and/or waiting list may be disqualified and denied a position on the list if such multiple requests are deemed, in the sole discretion of the Department, to adversely affect the fairness or orderly establishment of a list.






*§ 20-10 Selection of Applicants From Preference and/or Waiting List.* ::


When the number of permits outstanding falls below the statutory maximum of one-hundred (100) and at such time as the Department in its discretion may determine based upon a consideration of the number of vacancies, a number of persons on the preference and/or waiting list equal to the number of vacancies shall be notified by the Department, in preference and waiting list order, of their eligibility to apply for a full-term mobile food unit permit and shall form a pool of prospective applicants. Vacancies shall be filled from the highest preference category for which an applicant exists either on a waiting list or who may be identified as the result of the published notice specified in 24 RCNY § 20-04.






*§ 20-11 Eligibility to Apply for a Mobile Food Unit Permit.* ::


Only those persons who have been notified that their preference and/or waiting list number has been reached shall be eligible to submit an application for a mobile food unit permit. A person whose preference and/or waiting list number is reached and who holds a full-term, temporary or full-term borough-specific mobile food unit permit pursuant to subdivision g of § 17-307 of the Administrative Code, shall not be eligible for a permit pursuant to this preference and/or waiting list rule unless such previously held permit is surrendered or expires before a permit with respect to such waiting list position is issued. Positions on a preference and/or waiting list shall not be transferable.






*§ 20-12 Notification of Eligibility to Apply for Permit.* ::


Within ninety (90) days of mailing notification of eligibility to apply for a full-term mobile food unit permit issued pursuant to § 17-307(b)(3) of the Administrative Code, a person desiring to obtain such permit shall submit an application, completed in accordance with 24 RCNY Health Code § 5.05, together with the requisite fees therefor. The permit application shall be submitted on or before the ninetieth day.






*§ 20-13 Failure to Make Application for Permit.* ::


The failure of any person on the preference and/or waiting list who is notified of eligibility to apply for a permit, to complete the permit application process within ninety (90) days of being so notified, shall result in the forfeiture of such person's eligibility to apply for a permit and such person's preference and/or waiting list position.






*§ 20-14 Abandonment of Preference and/or Waiting List Position.* ::


A person who does not respond within ninety (90) days to a Departmental inquiry concerning a preference and/or waiting list position held by such person, mailed by ordinary mail to the address provided by such person, shall be deemed to have abandoned such list position.

(c) If an establishment required by 24 RCNY Health Code § 81.51 to post a letter grade receives a score of 14 or more points on the reinspection, and is not closed by the Department, the Department shall provide the establishment with a "grade pending" card and a grade card displaying the letter grade that corresponds with its inspection score at the reinspection. The establishment shall immediately post either the grade card or the "grade pending" card. If the establishment elects to post the "grade pending" card, it may only do so until it has had an opportunity to be heard at the Health Tribunal pursuant to subdivision (d) of this section and 24 RCNY Health Code § 81.51.

(d) Effect of adjudication at the Health Tribunal on grading of establishments required by 24 RCNY Health Code § 81.51 to post letter grades:

   (2) Subject to the provisions of paragraph (3) of this subdivision, if the establishment does not appear at the Health Tribunal on or before the scheduled hearing date, the establishment shall, on the date of the hearing, post the letter grade card provided by the Department at the reinspection.

   (3) If the establishment appears at the Health Tribunal on the scheduled date but is unable to proceed, or if the establishment makes a timely request for an adjournment and such adjournment is granted, the establishment may continue to post the "grade pending" card and defer posting the letter grade card until the adjourned hearing date. In no event shall an establishment fail to post the grade card after the adjourned hearing date if the establishment is not able to proceed on such date.

   (4) If the establishment appears at the Health Tribunal and as a result of such proceeding the score received for the reinspection changes in a way that results in a change of grade, the Department shall provide the establishment with a new letter grade card that shall be promptly posted by the establishment in place of any other letter grade card or "grade pending" card.

   (5) If the establishment receives notice of decision by mail, the establishment shall immediately upon receipt of the notice of decision remove any grade pending card and post the grade card provided with the notice of decision, if any. If no new grade card is issued with the notice of decision, the establishment shall immediately post the grade card issued by the Department at the reinspection.

The card shall be within five feet of the front door or other opening to the establishment where customers enter from the street, at a vertical height no less than four feet and no more than six feet from the ground or floor. An establishment without a direct entrance from the street shall post the grade card or "grade pending" card at a place designated by the Department at its immediate point of entry so that it is clearly visible to passersby.

Establishment of the five borough specific waiting lists in accordance with this Chapter shall be in accordance with the preference categories and any additional preferences within a preference category as listed in § 17-307(b)(4)(e) of the Administrative Code. No person shall be placed on a borough specific fruits and vegetables waiting list pursuant to this Chapter in a higher position than any person who is given a greater preference pursuant to § 17-307(b)(4)(e). Persons with a higher preference shall be given a higher weighted value in the selection process used to establish the borough specific fruits and vegetables waiting lists created pursuant to this Chapter. Persons who appear on any existing mobile food unit permit waiting list on the effective date of Local Law No. 9 of 2008 and who also classify themselves as disabled veterans shall receive a weighted value of 8. Persons who appear on any existing mobile food unit permit waiting list on the effective date of Local Law No. 9 of 2008 and who also classify themselves as disabled persons shall receive a weighted value of 7.

Persons not appearing on any existing mobile food unit permit waiting list on the effective date of Local Law No. 9 of 2008 but who classify themselves as non-disabled veterans shall receive a weighted value 2. All other persons shall receive a weighted value of 1. Persons of the same weighted value shall be placed on borough specific fruits and vegetables waiting lists in order pursuant to the borough rankings indicated by such persons in their applications.






*§ 26-04 Eligibility for Placement on Borough Specific Waiting Lists for Fresh Fruits and Vegetables Permits.* ::


To be eligible for inclusion on any of the waiting lists established pursuant to this Chapter, applicants shall be natural persons holding a valid mobile food vendor license at least ten (10) days prior to the Department's establishment of the borough specific fresh fruits and vegetables permit waiting lists created pursuant to this Chapter.






*§ 26-05 Notice of the Establishment of Borough Specific Waiting Lists for Fresh Fruits and Vegetables Permits.* ::


Notice of the Department's intention to establish fresh fruits and vegetables borough specific waiting lists shall be made by publication in the City Record at least fourteen days prior to the establishment of such lists.






*§ 26-06 Procedure for Requesting a Place on Waiting Lists.* ::


(a)  The Division of Permits shall use a mail-in procedure for establishing all waiting lists. Such procedure shall allow persons requesting placement on one or more of the five waiting lists established pursuant to this Chapter to submit a Department-issued waiting list application form, which shall contain their license number, their preference category, if applicable, and their choice(s) of borough specific fresh fruits and vegetables permit(s) they seek, by mail postmarked during a period of time to be determined by the Department, as specified in the Notice published pursuant to 24 RCNY § 26-05.

(b) The Notice shall advise those persons requesting placement on one or more of these five borough specific waiting list(s) to rank the waiting list(s) they select by order of borough choice. Applicants shall be directed to apply only for waiting list(s) for boroughs in which they would be willing to vend should they obtain such borough specific permit.

(c) Persons in the first preference category, as provided in § 17-307(b)(4)(e), shall not lose their position on any pre-existing waiting list as a result of their submission of an application for a fresh fruits and vegetables permit waiting list position or any resulting placement on any such list. A person on any existing waiting list who is issued a fresh fruits and vegetables permit also need not relinquish his or her place on any previously existing waiting list. Pursuant to § 17-307(b)(4)(b), however, a person shall be issued no more than one permit, whether full-term citywide, borough-specific full-term, temporary citywide or exclusively fresh fruits and vegetables.






*§ 26-07 Procedure for Establishment of Borough Specific Fresh Fruits and Vegetables Waiting Lists.* ::


Not less than fourteen days after the Notice required by 24 RCNY § 26-05 is published in the City Record, the Department shall create five separate borough specific full-term fresh fruits and vegetables waiting lists. Applicants holding valid mobile food vendor licenses at least ten (10) days prior to the Department's establishment of the fresh fruits and vegetables borough specific waiting lists created pursuant to this Chapter shall be included in the selection process, subject to the preferences and weighted values described in 24 RCNY § 26-03. Each applicant eligible for a position on any of these borough specific fresh fruits and vegetables waiting lists shall be able to obtain only one waiting list position per list. An applicant's position on a fresh fruits and vegetables borough specific waiting list shall be determined by his or her preference category, including the additional preferences within the category specified in § 17-307(b)(4)(e)(i) of the Administrative Code. Within each preference category, including the additional preferences within the category specified in § 17-307(b)(4)(e)(i) of the Administrative Code, those applicants specifying a borough as a preferred choice in which to operate shall be given preference on that borough's waiting list over those identifying that borough as a lesser choice. For each borough specific waiting list, applicants in identical preference categories, including the additional preferences within the category specified in § 17-307(b)(4)(e)(i) of the Administrative Code, who rank the applicable borough equally shall be placed on such borough specific waiting list in random order. The Department shall notify persons assigned a position on any of these waiting lists by mailing a notice to the address provided by the applicant on the applicant's waiting list application form.






*§ 26-08 Number of Positions on the Waiting Lists.* ::


The Department shall not impose a pre-set limit or maximum on the number of waiting list positions on each of the five borough specific fresh fruits and vegetables waiting lists. Those applicants eligible for a waiting list position on any of the five borough specific waiting lists during the permit waiting list application period set by the Department shall be included on the waiting lists for which they applied. When it deems it necessary, the Department in its discretion may seek to supplement any specific borough waiting list or all waiting lists with additional names, pursuant to the procedure specified in 24 RCNY §§ 26-03 through 26-07, except that 24 RCNY § 26-06(b) shall not apply.






*§ 26-09 Responsibility of Those on Waiting Lists to Notify the Department of Change of Address.* ::


(a)  The names of persons selected for a waiting list created pursuant to this rule shall be entered on each list for which they apply with their address of record as known to the Department through mobile food vendor license records, or with any updated address provided to the Department on the waiting list application form. Thereafter, it shall be the responsibility of each person placed on a waiting list to provide written notification to the Department of any change of address. The Department shall provide written confirmation of its receipt of such address change notification. The Department's written confirmation of its receipt of a change of address notification shall constitute proof that such notification was provided to the Department.

(b) Failure to provide change of address information or, when requested, proof of the Department's confirmation of receipt of such written notification, may result in the loss of a person's waiting list position(s) and such person's eligibility to apply for a fresh fruits and vegetables permit pursuant to § 17-307(b)(4) of the Administrative Code. Such person shall be deemed to have abandoned his or her place(s) on any of these borough specific fresh fruits and vegetables waiting list(s) and shall not be eligible for a fresh fruits and vegetables permit unless such person participates in the process of list establishment pursuant to 24 RCNY §§ 26-03 through 26-07, except that 24 RCNY § 26-06(b) shall not apply.






*§ 26-10 Multiple Requests for Waiting List Position on any One Borough Specific Fruits and Vegetables Waiting List Prohibited.* ::


An applicant may apply for and obtain no more than one waiting list position on each of the borough specific waiting lists established pursuant to this Chapter and shall be eligible to obtain and possess only one permit. Before the creation of the borough specific fresh fruits and vegetables waiting lists, the Department shall attempt to ascertain that a mobile food vendor licensee is represented only once in the pool of licensees from which the selection is to be made in producing each of the five borough specific fresh fruits and vegetables lists pursuant to 24 RCNY § 26-07. Should the Department receive more than one request for a waiting list position on any one borough list from any person, requests subsequent to the first shall be deemed invalid. A person who submits more than one request for a position on any one borough specific fresh fruits and vegetables waiting list created pursuant to these rules may be disqualified and denied a position on that borough specific fresh fruits and vegetables waiting list if such multiple requests are deemed, in the sole discretion of the Department, to adversely affect the fairness or orderly establishment of that specific borough list.






*§ 26-11 Selection of Applicants From a Waiting List.* ::


When the number of fresh fruits and vegetables permits outstanding for a particular borough falls below the statutory maximum for that borough and at such time as the Department in its discretion may determine based upon a consideration of the number of permit vacancies, a number of persons on such waiting list sufficient to fill the number of permit vacancies shall be notified by the Department, by waiting list order, of their eligibility to apply for a fresh fruits and vegetables permit to be used exclusively in a specific borough and shall form a pool of prospective applicants. Only one permit shall be issued for each eligible waiting list position or applicant.






*§ 26-12 Eligibility to Apply for a Fresh Fruits and Vegetables Permit.* ::


Only those persons who have been notified that their waiting list number has been reached shall be eligible to submit an application for a fresh fruits and vegetables borough specific permit. A person whose waiting list number is reached and who holds another mobile food unit permit issued by the Department to vend on public space, shall not be eligible for a fresh fruits and vegetables permit pursuant to this rule unless such previously held permit is surrendered or expires before a permit with respect to such fresh fruits and vegetables waiting list is issued. Positions on a waiting list shall not be transferable.






*§ 26-13 Notification of Eligibility to Apply For Permit.* ::


Within thirty (30) days of mailing notification of eligibility to apply for a fresh fruits and vegetables permit issued pursuant to § 17-307(b)(4) of the Administrative Code, a person desiring to obtain such permit shall submit an application, completed in accordance with 24 RCNY Health Code § 5.05, together with the requisite fees and requested supporting documentation therefore. The permit application shall be submitted on or before the thirtieth day.






*§ 26-14 Failure to Make Application for Permit or Complete Inspection Process, Declination of Permit.* ::


(a)  A person on a borough specific fresh fruits and vegetables waiting list who is notified of his or her eligibility to apply for a permit and who fails to submit a completed permit application to the Department within thirty (30) days of being notified by the Department, or who otherwise communicates to the Department his or her lack of interest in the permit offered, shall result in the forfeiture of such person's waiting list position and the permit shall be offered to the next person on that borough specific fresh fruits and vegetables waiting list.

(b) A person notified of his or her eligibility to apply for a fresh fruits and vegetables permit to vend in a borough not his or her first choice, as that choice was specified on that person's waiting list application, who applies for a permit for such borough and who presents documentation supporting his or her claim of eligibility in one of the preference categories listed in § 17-307(b)(4)(e) of the Administrative Code, if applicable, and whose mobile food unit passes the Department's required inspection pursuant to § 17-307(b)(2)(d) of the Administrative Code, shall not lose his or her waiting list positions(s) on any other borough specific fresh fruits and vegetables waiting lists of higher choice, as stated on the same waiting list application form. Such fresh fruits and vegetables permittee, however, shall forfeit his or her position(s) on existing borough specific fresh fruits and vegetables waiting lists of lesser choice as stated on his or her waiting list application form.

(c) Any person notified that their waiting list number on a selected borough specific fresh fruits and vegetables waiting list has been reached and who is eligible to apply for this permit but who declines such borough specific permit offer shall be required to forfeit all waiting list positions on any other existing fresh fruits and vegetables waiting lists.

(d) Any person who fails to submit documentation satisfactory to the Department demonstrating that such person belongs to a preference category listed in § 17-307(b)(4)(e) or whose mobile food unit does not pass the Department's required inspection, in accordance with § 17-307(b)(2)(d) of the Administrative Code, shall be required to forfeit all such person's waiting list positions on all existing borough specific fresh fruits and vegetables waiting lists.

(e) The failure of any person to timely apply for a permit offered as specified in this section, complete the Department's inspection process or a person's declination of a specific borough permit offered pursuant to this Chapter, shall not affect that person's standing on any non-fresh fruits and vegetables mobile food unit permit waiting list.






*§ 26-15 Abandonment of Waiting List Position.* ::


(a)  A person who does not respond within thirty (30) days to a Departmental inquiry concerning a waiting list position held by such person, mailed by ordinary mail to the address provided by such person, shall be deemed to have abandoned such waiting list position. That person shall also be deemed to have abandoned or forfeited his or her standing on any other existing fresh fruits and vegetables waiting list on which he or she may appear.

(b) A person who holds a waiting list position may withdraw his or her name at any time by providing written notice to the Department with verifying documentation satisfactory to the Department.
