During the construction period coverage may be for less than the amount of the loan. Such policy must contain a loss payable clause, naming the City of New York, c/o Department of Housing Preservation and Development as mortgagee and further provide that "buildings in course of renovation with permission granted to complete and occupy" or a similar description to this effect. When the improvements are completed, such proviso is to be deleted from the policy.

(b) An original policy of owners protective liability and property damage insurance issued to the contractor, with the owner and "The City of New York Department of Housing Preservation and Development" as additional insured, to protect the owner and the City against claims for property damage and for personal injuries, including accidental death caused by the operations of the contractor or his sub-contractors during the performance of work at the building or adjacent thereto, in at least the sum of $100,000 - $300,000 bodily injury and $25,000 - $50,000 property damage, or in such larger amounts as may be determined by the Agency.

   (2) a financial statement by each party executing such a guarantee, showing sufficient net assets and net worth to give reasonable certainty of financial ability to fulfill such commitment, and

   (3) an amount equal to two (2%) percent of the construction cost as a non-refundable fee. The Agency may in its discretion, where satisfactory proof has been presented that after a diligent effort such bond cannot be obtained, accept in lieu thereof bonds furnished by subcontractors covering at least fifty (50%) percent of the construction cost, in which case the balance of the construction cost shall be covered by guarantees of completion and fees as described above.

*§ 1-08 Mortgage Conditions.* ::


(a) No loan may exceed the maximum mortgage amount.

(b) Each loan made under this program shall be secured by a bond or note and mortgage upon the multiple dwelling to be improved and the land upon which it is situated to be repaid over or within a period of thirty years in such manner as may be provided therein.

(c) The Agency may take a junior lien on the property as security for the loan or may, in accordance with the provisions of the Private Housing Finance Law, participate in a rehabilitation loan with a private lender, provided that the total indebtedness will not exceed the maximum mortgage amount after completion of rehabilitation. In determining whether to take a junior lien the Agency shall give favorable consideration to the following, if present: that the interest rate on the prior lien is more favorable than the Agency can offer the mortgagor; that the holder of the prior lien is an institutional lender of recognized standing; and that the principal amounts due under the prior lien or liens are being amortized on a basis which would not jeopardize the City's lien. A subordination agreement may be required from the holder of any prior lien where the Agency deems it desirable.

(d) The mortgagor shall be required at the closing to execute a construction contract for the performance of the work with a general contractor or tradesman. Both the contract and the general contractor or tradesman must be approved by the Agency and the Agency reserves unto itself the right to approve or reject a contractor. The mortgagor shall be required to submit a resume of the experiences of the proposed contractor and all proposed subcontractors, financial statements of the contractor and for all firms in which the contractor has a controlling interest for the last three years, references from at least three major clients of each contractor, and a statement of the ethnic breakdown of the employees of each such contractor and subcontractor in advance of such closing.

(e) At the closing of the loan, the owner shall advise the Agency by a sworn statement of changes, if any, that have occurred since the date of application for the loan with respect to condition of the building, mortgage balances, acquisition cost, taxes, liens, discounts and assignments, and any change in relationship of parties in interest, and if there have been no changes, shall so state. If any portion of the loan is used to satisfy a mortgage, the mortgagor will be required at the closing to provide a certificate from the holder of the mortgage as to the amount paid by such mortgagee for the mortgage, where applicable, and the balance due thereon.

(f) Interest and amortization payments shall be due and payable commencing on the first day of the third month after a certificate of occupancy, temporary or permanent, has been obtained, where applicable. This period may be extended upon due notice by the Agency to the City Comptroller where occupancy is dependent on conditions beyond the owner's control such as the availability of Federal rent supplements.

(g) A mortgagor may not, at any time, further encumber, mortgage or permit any encumbrance or lien of any kind upon the mortgaged premises without the prior written consent of the Agency, nor may the premises or any part thereof be conveyed, assigned or transferred without the prior written consent of the Agency. Failure to comply with this subdivision (g) at the option of the Agency, shall result in the Agency's declaring the entire unpaid principal balance and interest immediately due and payable.

(h) The mortgage may provide that with the consent of the Agency a mortgagor may prepay the principal amount of the loan together with interest then due. However, the apartments in the premises shall remain subject to the conditions set forth in 28 RCNY § 1-03 (Eligibility and General Conditions).

(i) The Agency shall establish first rentals or adjust maximum rents, whichever is applicable, for all buildings rehabilitated with a municipal loan and certify same to the Division of Housing and Community Renewal. In arriving at such rent levels, the Agency shall consider the total of the projected operating costs, including water and sewer taxes, fuel, insurance, utilities, painting and repairs, and vacancy allowance, a reasonable return on the owner's equity and interest and amortization payments on the mortgage.






*§ 1-09 Fee Requirements.* ::

Applications filed with the Office of Special Improvements must be accompanied by such a check payable to "Small Loan Program Application Account" in the amount of one hundred dollars ($100) for such purposes.

(b) All mortgage loans are subject to a supervision fee in the amount of two (2%) percent of the total loan, payable to the City of New York. Such fee may be waived by the Agency in whole or in part in the case of loans under $4,200 per unit.

(c) A fee in lieu of payment and performance bond, where applicable, shall be requested equal to two (2%) percent of the estimated construction cost, which sum shall be deposited by the Agency in its Rehabilitation Loan Reserve Fund.

(d) A management fee in the amount of 1/4 percent of the original principal amount of the loan shall be charged and payable per annum to meet costs of supervision during the life of the loan. The Agency may in its discretion deposit such sum in its Rehabilitation Loan Fund or use such sum in whole or in part to pay a bank or the New York City Housing Development Corporation for the performance of such services as are generally performed by a banking institution which itself owns and holds a mortgage.

(e) Where a monthly installment of principal and interest on a mortgage has become overdue for a period in excess of fifteen (15) days a "late charge" of one (1) cent per month for every dollar of such installment so overdue may be charged the mortgagor by the Agency and deposited in its Rehabilitation Loan Reserve Fund.

(f) The Agency may determine in its sole discretion to submit the loan application to the New York City Housing Corporation. In the event that such corporation is or shall become the mortgagee, all fees required by this section shall be paid to the corporation rather than to the City of New York, except as the Agency may otherwise prescribe.

(g) None of the fees provided for by this section are refundable.






*§ 1-10 Construction Requirements: Payments.* ::


(a) The plans, specifications, work write-ups or any description of work to be performed on a building subject to a loan under this program must be approved by the applicable office of the Agency prior to the commencement of any rehabilitation work or the closing of a mortgage loan for same. Such plans, specifications, work write-ups or other description of work must conform to the rehabilitation design standards of the Agency and must have been approved by the Department of Buildings, where applicable, or any other necessary governmental bureau or department.

(b) During the rehabilitation process the Agency's architects, engineers, rehabilitation specialists or officers and others designated by the Agency may conduct periodic inspections of the work. Copies of all plans, specifications, work write-ups or other description of work, with the Agency's approval stamped thereon, must be kept on the job site for the use of such Agency personnel.

(c) Requests for change-orders shall be in writing. Change-orders must be fully documented, showing original and revised cost estimates and reasons for such change-orders. Upon approval thereof, which shall also be in writing, the change shall be reflected in a revised trade payment breakdown.

(d) The Agency may require the deposit of loan advances in a separate escrow account, in a bank designated by the Agency, subject to withdrawal only upon the joint signatures of the borrower and a representative of the Agency. The Agency may further require that the owner deposit all or a designated portion of the rents collected from the multiple dwellings during the period of construction in such escrow account, or in a separate trust account under such terms and provisions as the Agency shall prescribe.

(e) Progress payments on work completed shall be made on the basis of sworn statements as herein provided, subject to review and approval by the Agency. At the time of each progress payment, the contractor, mortgagor or owner shall execute for the Agency a sworn statement that all bills due for labor, services rendered, and materials furnished in connection with the work to the date of payment are paid and that no liens have been filed, or if not paid, submit list itemizing the amounts due to creditors so as to insure a proper allocation of the payment to satisfy in full such unpaid items. Such statement shall reconcile requisitions with the trade payment breakdown previously submitted. The Agency reserves unto itself the right, at its discretion, to take proceeds of the loan and pay all verified delinquent claims for labor, materials or other services rendered. The Agency shall further withhold an amount equal to no less than ten percent of the total amount of each progress payment as a retention fund under the mortgage to assure satisfactory progress of the work. Such retention, or a portion thereof, may be released prior to the completion of the work upon written request by the owner or mortgagor with the approval of the Deputy Commissioner of the Agency; the retention on completed work may thus be reduced to five percent upon completion of fifty percent of the work. All of the retention remaining shall be released upon the completion of the work to the entire satisfaction of the Agency and other necessary state or municipal bureaus or departments, the presentation to the Agency of a permanent certificate of occupancy, where applicable, proof of payment for all labor and materials, a cost certification prepared and certified by an independent public accountant licensed by New York State, and also a sworn certificate disclosing any changes from the applicant's filing in accordance with 28 RCNY § 1-06(g) (Application Submission).

(f) The portion of the loan representing interest on advances during construction shall be adjusted upon completion of the rehabilitation as follows: If such portion shall be more than the amount required for interest on advances, the excess shall be credited to the mortgagor in reduction of the principal of the loan; if less than the amount required for such interest, the difference shall be deducted from the final payment of loan proceeds and paid over to the City of New York.

(g) Any income derived during any period of occupancy prior to commencement of debt service may be credited against the construction loan.

(h) Books and records of the contractor and of subcontractors relative to the rehabilitation shall be subject to audit by the Agency. All subcontracts shall be submitted to the Agency when executed and any interest between the mortgagor and the subcontractor shall be disclosed at that time.

(i) The aforementioned cost certification shall be provided on a form approved by the Agency and must include the following:

   (1) A certified list of the actual costs paid by the general contractor for materials and sub-contract work under the general contract.

   (2) A certified list of the actual costs for non-construction items as were approved by the Agency.

   (3) Proof that all labor and materials included in the rehabilitation have been paid for.

(a) The contractor will not discriminate against any employee or applicant for employment because of race, creed, color, national origin or sexual orientation. The contractor will take affirmative action to insure that applicants are employed, and that employees are treated during employment without regard to their race, creed, color, national origin or sexual orientation. Such action will include, but not be limited to the following: employment, up-grading, demotion, transfer, recruitment or recruitment advertising, layoff or termination, rates of pay or other forms of compensation, and selection for training, including apprenticeship. The contractor agrees to post in conspicuous places, available to employees and applicants for employment, notices to be provided by the Agency setting forth the provisions of this non-discrimination clause.

(b) The contractor will participate in an on-the-job training program in accordance with the Mayor's Executive Order No. 50 of 1980 as amended and the agreement dated December 10, 1970 with the New York Building and Construction Industry, Board of Urban Affairs Fund, and will enter into a contract with the Agency to implement such training program.

(c) To the extent that such preference is not inconsistent with the Executive Orders and the agreements referred to in subdivision (b) above, the contractor, including sub-contractors within model cities, urban renewal and code enforcement areas will give a priority in hiring to persons living within the geographic neighborhood in which the work is being performed.

(d) The contractor will not sub-contract any part of the work without prior written approval of the Agency. The Agency will not approve any sub-contractor for work who is at the time ineligible because of violations of this 28 RCNY § 1-11 (Labor Compliance Conditions), inefficiency, abandonment of duties, or disregard for creditors on prior jobs performed under this program. Failure to comply with the provisions of this 28 RCNY § 1-11 will result in the Agency's withholding from the contractor any progress payments, in addition to exercising such other rights as may be reserved to the Agency in the loan documents, and forfeiture by the contractor of consideration for future work under this program.

(e) With every requisition for a progress payment or at such times as the Agency shall prescribe, the contractor shall submit to the Agency copies of his payroll report and of each of the sub-contractors (it being understood that the contractor will be responsible for the submission of records of sub-contractors). Such payroll report shall contain such items as prescribed by the Agency including, but not limited to, the name and address of each employee, his classification or trade, ethnic/racial origin, hourly rate of pay, deductions made, number of hours worked and actual wages paid for the work week.

(f) In order to assure strict compliance with this section and these rules and regulations, the books and records of the general contractor or tradesman and all sub-contractors shall at all times be available to the agents or representatives of this Agency and the Agency reserves the right to interview or confer with any employee on a construction job or in the office of general contractor or tradesman or sub-contractor, at any time, in order to determine such strict compliance. Failure to comply with this chapter shall be considered a breach of construction contract and may result, at the discretion of the Agency, in the removal of the general contractor, tradesman or sub-contractor from the construction job and other penalties as the Agency might deem necessary to impose.






*§ 1-12 Management Supervisory Requirements.* ::


(a) Neither an owner, nor anyone acting in his behalf, shall make a charge or demand a fee of any kind for processing a tenant's application.

(b) The owner shall receive no more than one month's rent as security and one month's rent in advance at the time the tenant takes occupancy of premises rented after the loan is granted. Upon direction by the Agency, such security deposits when received by the owner shall be immediately submitted to the Agency to be held in escrow by the Agency for the benefit of the tenant. The Agency will deposit all such funds in a separate interest bearing account with a banking institution of the Agency's choice. The records of such account shall be available at all times to an owner or tenant for the purposes of audit, inspection or examination, and interest accruing from such account shall enure to the benefit of the tenant-depositor. The principal amount of such deposit together with interest thereon shall be returned to the tenant by the Agency upon the written request of the owner certifying that the tenant's occupancy has been terminated and that all the terms and conditions of such occupancy have been complied with.

(c) The apartments in a rehabilitation building are available to persons or families of low income as defined in 28 RCNY § 1-02 (Definitions).

   (1) Probable aggregate annual income includes the annual income of the chief wage earner of the family, plus all other income of other members of the family in excess of $1,500 per annum for each such member. The income of a working minor who is a full-time student shall not be included in the computation of such annual income. Social Security or other pension plan payments received by females aged sixty-two years and over, or males sixty-five or over shall be excluded from computation of annual income up to a total maximum amount of $75 a month per individual.

   (2) If at the time a loan is granted, the tenant's probable annual income exceeds, or later increases so as to exceed, the prescribed income limits by more than fifty percent, he can be removed, with the Agency's consent, from the building either the expiration of a two-(2) year period from the time the loan was granted.

   (3) A tenant who moves into the building after the loan has been granted is subject to removal, with the Agency's consent, when his yearly income exceeds the income limits by more than fifty percent.

   (4) If, after the expiration of a two-year period from the time the loan was granted, more than twenty percent of the tenants in the building are over-income, the Agency may require the owner to remove over-income tenants.

   (5) When the owner of the building occupies one of the units, he will be liable for rent surcharges the same as any tenant.

   (6) Any person or family in occupancy whose income exceeds the maximum prescribed shall pay a rent surcharge in accordance with the following schedule:

The owner of the dwelling must, subject to the approval of the Agency, take the action necessary to assure compliance with these provisions. Rental surcharges collected by the owner are paid to the Agency by check made out to the order of the City of New York and are used to reimburse the City for any tax exemption or abatement granted to the owner. If such benefits have not been granted, or if a sum equal to the amount of tax exemption and abatement granted has already been paid to the City, the surcharge shall be paid to the City in reduction of the loan in accordance with § 403 Subdivision 4 of Article VIII of the Private Housing Finance Law.

(d) Tenants for initial occupancy of such rehabilitated buildings, and for the filing of vacancies as they occur, shall be selected by the Owner in the following order of priority:

   (1) Site occupants, that is, tenants occupying the building on the date of preliminary site submission or such later date approved by the Agency. "Building" in this paragraph shall include parcels subject to a consolidated loan. Where the Housing Authority has entered into a leasing program regarding the rehabilitated building, all tenants eligible for public housing must apply to the Housing Authority to recognize their priority.

   (2) Tenants in occupancy shall have the first priority for internal transfer.

   (3) If the site is within an urban renewal area or other redevelopment area, residents of sites acquired to effectuate the plans for such area; families in emergency need of housing, including families who are homeless, under warrant of eviction, living in buildings condemned as unfit for human habitation, or facing displacement from sites, buildings or dwelling units being cleared or vacated by governmental action. Within this class preference shall be given to residents of the same community planning district.

   (4) Persons listed on the outside waiting list in strict chronological order.

   (5) Others, subject to Agency approval. Notwithstanding the foregoing, where a federal subsidy is involved, federal standards of priority are controlling as to the affected apartments.

(e) The Agency may direct that a certain number of apartments be held vacant until the building is at least 70 percent occupied by relocatees having priorities (1) through (3) of subdivision (d) above, but not beyond the date when debt service commences. Implementation of the priority system described above shall be accomplished as follows:

   (1) The owner shall submit to the Agency, prior to renting, a Tenant Selection Review Form prescribed by the Agency.

   (2) The owner shall fully complete such form and state whether he wishes to reject or accept the tenant applicant.

   (3) The Agency shall render a decision on acceptability of the tenant within three working days of receipt of the Tenant Selection Review Form.

   (4) The Agency reserves the right to approve or reject any tenant applicant and the owner agrees to be bound by its decision. It shall be the owner's responsibility to contact the Agency to obtain such decision. If the applicant is rejected, the owner will follow the same procedure for any other applicant he considers.

   (5) The owner shall accept referrals from whatever governmental source the Agency may designate. Where the Agency determines that an owner has rejected a tenant applicant, it reserves the right to order him to submit another applicant for that housing unit. The fact that an applicant is on welfare shall not be grounds for rejection. Failure to submit a Tenant Selection Review Form to the Agency, failure to obtain Agency approval prior to renting, or renting an apartment to a tenant applicant who has not been approved by the Agency, shall, at the option of the Agency, make the owner liable for the expense of finding a comparable housing unit for another applicant who is eligible under renting priorities set forth above and for any unusual cost in relocating such applicant in such comparable unit.

(f) At the discretion of the Agency, the owner may be required to enter into a regulatory agreement with regard to the management and operation of the building and the rents, profits, dividends or distribution of its property and as otherwise prescribed by the Agency.

(g) The owner shall maintain separate and accurate books and records of all managerial and financial data, including assets, liabilities, equity, income and expense, relative to the rehabilitated property or properties for which a separate loan has been made. Such books and records must be made available to the representatives of the Agency for audit, examination or review upon demand. Unless this requirement is modified or waived in the case of a loan under $4,200 per unit, financial reports as prescribed by the Agency relative to a rehabilitated property or properties for which such a separate loan has been made are required to be filed in duplicate, with the Agency for the six-month period ended December 31, and the twelve-month (annual) period ended each June 30. The reports are due within 90 days after the close of each respective period. The indicated filing requirements are to be met with respect to the initial operating periods although these may not be full six- or twelve- month periods. Such reports are to be based on audit examination, in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards, by an independent public accountant licensed in New York State. The annual report, for the fiscal year ended each June 30, is to be certified by such accountant relative to the financial statements and other data required to be contained therein. The foregoing reports are to include the following:

   (1) Accountant's certification.

   (2) Financial statements (accrual basis).

      (i) Balance Sheet, with such supporting schedules as required to be fully informative.

      (ii) Statement of Operations, with detailed income and expense subclassifications. The annual statement shall also show separately the operating figures for the last six months of the fiscal year, January l-June 30.

      (iii) Statement of Sources and Application of Funds (Change in net working capital). There shall also be filed such other financial reports or data as the Agency may require.

(h) The Agency reserves the right to make periodic inspection on each apartment in the rehabilitated building. Such inspections shall be for the purpose of inspecting the condition and maintenance of the building, the condition of utilities, fixture and equipment. Periodic visits may also be made to the building by representatives of the Agency for the purpose of conferring with tenants, advising on consumer practices, frauds and products, education regarding maintenance of dwellings and where necessary serving as a liaison or intermediary on landlord-tenant problems. Copies of reports of such inspections shall be made available to the owner with recommendations for corrective measures where necessary.

(i) Re-renting or eviction proceedings may only take place with the approval of the Agency. No new tenants may be moved into a building without the owner's following the same procedures as hereinabove set forth.

   (1) Any work beyond the scope of the contract requirements requested by the Department of Housing Preservation and Development in writing, shall be paid to the architect at the rate of two and a half times the reasonable salaries of technicians engaged in such changes.

   (2) When the basic plans are repeated for identical buildings (within twenty percent of design is reused) then such fee shall be reduced by thirty-three and a third percent of original design fee.

   (3) Architect shall supply all required services, plans, specifications and filing with the Department of Buildings.

(b) Such rentals may thereafter be increased upon application made by the owner to the office or department charged with administration of the Program in the manner set forth herein and as set forth in § 33.9 of the Rent and Eviction Regulations and the rules and regulations adopted pursuant thereto. If such office or department determines that a rent increase is required based upon operating and maintenance expenses, real estate taxes, debt service requirements, vacancy and other rent collection losses, and a return on equity computed at 8 percent, the director of that office or department shall so certify to the Office of Rent Control and inform the Office of Rent Control of the amount of the increases which are requested. The Office of Rent Control shall issue written notice to the tenants of the rent increases requested by the owner. Upon expiration of the time allowed for the tenants to answer as set forth in such notice, the Office of Rent Control shall forward any responses to the administering office or department. Such office or department shall review the responses and the record and may then request that the Office of Rent Control issue orders adjusting the rents as finally determined by that office or department. The Office of Rent Control will issue such orders within fifteen days after receipt of such request.






*§ 1-16 Failure to Comply with Regulations.* ::


Upon failure of an applicant, owner or mortgagor to comply with this chapter, said applicant, owner or mortgagor may be disqualified by the Agency from applying for a loan under this program for up to three years following the date of any failure.






*§ 1-17 Waiver.* ::


The Agency may waive any of this chapter where the nature of the installation, alteration, improvement or rehabilitation or other circumstances warrant such exception. Any waiver to be effective requires the approval of the Commissioner or the Municipal Loan Committee.

The acceptance or processing of a loan application by the Department may not be construed to be a commitment for a loan. A commitment may only be issued in writing and no owner, applicant or other party may rely upon any statement or representation made by any official, employee or agent of the Department regarding the loan application.






*§ 2-04 Determination of Feasibility and Conditions Precedent to Making a Loan.* ::


(a) Low income tenancy and rent increases.

   (1) Covenant on low income tenancy. No loan shall be made unless the owner covenants in writing that so long as any part of the loan shall remain unpaid:

      (i) Upon vacancy, each dwelling unit in the multiple dwelling shall be available solely for occupancy by persons or families of low income; and

      (ii) No person living in the multiple dwelling at the time the loan is made shall be required to move because of the rehabilitation or improvement financed by the loan, other than temporarily during the course of construction.

   (2) Rent increases.

      (i) The Department, in its sole discretion, shall have the option to adjust the rent for each rental unit within the multiple dwelling pursuant to authority granted by subdivision 7 of § 452 of the Private Housing Finance Law of the State of New York. The total rental adjustment shall be in an amount not in excess of the debt service (both principal and interest) calculated on that portion of the loan which the Department attributes to the financing of the rehabilitation of the rental units as if such loan were to be repaid over a self-amortizing term to be determined by HPD which shall be not less than ten (10) years for loans averaging five thousand ($5,000) dollars or less per dwelling unit, and not less than fifteen (15) years for loans exceeding five thousand ($5,000) dollars per dwelling unit. The initial rental adjustment for each rental dwelling unit will be calculated by dividing the total rental adjustment by the total number of rental rooms. Such adjustment shall be applied equally on a per room per month basis, except that a greater adjustment may be allowed for vacant units. For loans which closed prior to the effective date of these regulations, unequal adjustments may be allowed if HPD sends notification of such rent adjustment to the tenants prior to the closing of the loan. For rents to be adjusted under the provisions of this subparagraph, the owner(s) of the premises must agree to waive any and all increases which are attributable to the completed rehabilitation work financed by the 8A loan or required pursuant to the Housing Repair and Maintenance Agreement to which he might be entitled under the Administrative Code Chapters 4 and/or 5 of Title 26. Rental adjustments under this subparagraph shall have no effect upon the status of

         (A) rent stabilized units which will remain stabilized with the rental adjustment added to the then current rent and subject to continuing lease increases granted by the appropriate governmental authority, or

         (B) rent controlled units which will remain controlled with the rental adjustment added to the then current maximum base rent and maximum collectible rent and subject to continuing increases in the maximum base rent and maximum collectible rent granted by the appropriate governmental authority. Nothing contained in this subparagraph (2)(i) shall affect the time period for the repayment of the loan as determined by the Department under 28 RCNY § 2-02(d).

      (ii) As an alternative to the rental adjustment provided under the preceding sub- paragraph (2)(i) the Department may in appropriate circumstances restructure the rents under § 33.9 of the New York City Rent and Eviction Regulations provided the rents as restructured do not exceed the average rent prevailing in local projects of municipally-aided limited- profit housing companies aided under Article II of the Private Housing Finance Law of the State of New York, the occupancy of which commenced on or after May 18, 1970, or in the case of a single room occupancy housing, seventy-five (75%) percent of the Moderate Rehabilitation Fair Market Rent, as defined in these regulations, for 0-bedroom units.

   (3) Status of apartments. Loans may be made irrespective of the current status of control, stabilization or decontrol of dwelling units and shall not have any effect upon such present or future status of the units.

   (4) Tenant notification. Prior to final approval of the loan, the owner shall be required to give tenants residing in the multiple dwelling written notification of the proposed rehabilitation or improvement and the possibility of rent increases, in form specified or approved by the Department. The owner shall submit an affidavit to the Department certifying that such written notification has been given to the tenants. The Department shall notify the tenants in writing no later than twenty-eight (28) calendar days prior to the loan closing of the nature of the proposed rehabilitation or improvement and any projected rent increases. The tenants may forward their comments or objections regarding the proposed loan to the Department for consideration of all relevant issues. The Department, in its discretion, may hold or require the owner to hold at least one public meeting with the tenants or their representatives to discuss the proposed rehabilitation or improvement and any projected rent increases. The Department may, as an alternative to its twenty-eight day notification, hold a tenant meeting if at least three (3) business days before the meeting a copy of the Department's notification letter is sent by ordinary mail to all tenants. If rents are to be adjusted pursuant to 28 RCNY § 2-04(a)(2)(i), the Department shall send by ordinary mail a written notice of the approximate expected rent increase after the completion of the rehabilitation or improvement and prior to the establishment of the rental adjustments. After this notification, tenants may again forward their comments or objections to the Department for consideration. The Department shall consider any comments or objections that it considers to be relevant to the rent increases and which are received within ten (10) days after the date of mailing (by deposit in a general or branch post office or other official depository of the United States Postal Service) of the Department's notification.

(b) Real estate taxes, assessments, water and meter charges and sewer rents. The owner shall make full and timely payment of current real estate taxes, assessments, water and meter charges and sewer rents during the term of the loan. At the time of the loan closing real estate taxes, assessments, water and meter charges or sewer rents may, with the consent of the Department, be in arrears, provided all such arrears, including any interest and penalties thereon, shall be discharged by the owner subsequent to the loan closing pursuant to arrangements satisfactory to the Department. The Department may require under terms and provisions as it shall prescribe, that the owner place money in escrow on a monthly basis to cover any outstanding real estate taxes, assessments, water and meter charges and sewer rents, accrued interest and penalties, or payments of principal and interest on the loan and one-twelfth of the prospective annual real estate taxes, assessments, water and meter charges, sewer rents and premiums for insurance. Unless otherwise required by the Department as a condition precedent to the loan and subject to all provisions of this chapter, the owner may apply for any rent adjustment or other benefits, including tax exemption and/or tax abatement, to which he, as a result of the rehabilitation or improvement, may become entitled under the provisions of the Administrative Code and all regulations promulgated thereunder.

(c) Relationship of loan to other mortgages.

   (1) Existing mortgages. Loans may be made with respect to a multiple dwelling encumbered by mortgages provided no mortgage is in default, except by reason of the deteriorated physical condition of the building, if such condition and default shall be remedied by the proposed rehabilitation or improvement.

The owner shall not exclude any person, including prospective tenants, from participation in, deny any person the benefits of, or subject any person to discrimination under this Program on the grounds of race, color, national origin, creed, age, sex, or sexual orientation. If an owner, contractor or subcontractor fails to comply with the provisions of this paragraph (1), the Department, in its discretion, may, in addition to or as an alternative to any other remedies reserved to the City or the Department in the loan documents, withhold progress payments to the owner or disapprove the contractor or subcontractor for future work under this Program or other programs of the Department.

   (2) Books, records and inspections. In order to assure strict compliance with this subdivision (c), all contractors and subcontractors will be required to sign an agreement, in form specified by the Department, to make their books and records available for inspection by representatives or agents of the Department.

Applications are only transferable to spouses, siblings, or children who are at least eighteen years of age as of the date of the applicant's initial application, provided that such spouse's, sibling's, or children's names appeared on the applicant's initial application. Each applicant shall only be entitled to one entry per lottery for a housing company development. Multiple entries shall result in disqualification from such lottery. Furthermore, an applicant whose name is selected in a lottery cannot be included in the family composition of any other applicant who is selected in the same lottery for that particular housing company development. Such inclusion in multiple selected family compositions also shall result in disqualification of all involved parties from such lottery.

   (4) Each application, together with income and occupancy information and other data as hereinafter specified, shall be investigated by the housing company at the time an apartment is offered to determine the eligibility of the applicant. The data received by any housing company relative to tenant income shall be regarded as confidential in nature and protected accordingly to the extent permitted by law. In the case of a mutual housing company development, applicants approved by the mutual housing company shall upon notification of such approval be required to pay the balance of the purchase price of the shares allocated to the apartment.

   (8) (i)  All housing companies, whether mutual or rental, shall maintain all waiting lists on forms approved by HPD for all tenant/cooperator applications for apartments, listed in chronological order, by apartment size, by date of receipt or by order of selection by lottery, as applicable. All eligibility requirements for age, residency and family composition must be met by the cut-off date for the lottery. As used in this chapter, the term "tenant/cooperator" shall mean a tenant residing in an apartment in a rental development and/or a shareholder/proprietary lessee residing in an apartment in a mutual housing company development, as the case may be. These master waiting lists shall be kept in the management office. A conformed copy of the master waiting lists by apartment size shall be sent to HPD. Thereafter, on a semi-annual basis, or more frequently if requested by HPD, updated waiting lists shall be submitted to HPD. The waiting lists must reflect the status of each application, i.e. who received an apartment, who declined an apartment, who withdrew, or any other circumstances, including dates the actions were taken.

      (ii) The opening and closing of all waiting lists shall be subject to prior written approval of HPD. The lottery for the units that become available through the opening of a waiting list must be advertised through the New York City Housing Connect/Mitchell-Lama Connect lottery system or any successor program administered by HPD to market vacant Mitchell-Lama units. Such lottery also must be advertised through advertisements that have been approved by HPD and published in at least two daily newspapers of general circulation and two publications known to have a high readership amongst minorities. Housing companies must thereafter select applicants from the New York City Housing Connect/Mitchell Lama Connect or successor program lottery. When a list has sufficient names on it to last for three years, the list may be closed by HPD. Waiting lists for various size apartments may be closed at different times as the particular apartment-size list attains sufficient names.

      (iii) No application shall be taken or deposit accepted for a position on the waiting list subsequent to the official closing of such waiting list. Any application added to the waiting list after the official closing date shall be rejected by HPD.

   (9) Each applicant and members of his or her household shall furnish an affidavit attesting to the gross household income for the preceding year and the anticipated gross household income for the current year. Each applicant and members of his or her household shall also be required to furnish to the housing company or HPD certified copies of tax returns filed by them with the Internal Revenue Service ("IRS") and the New York State Department of Taxation and Finance for the preceding or subsequent years for admission purposes as well as during their occupancy of a dwelling unit of the development. Applicant and members of his or her household shall assume the cost of obtaining certified copies for these purposes. Failure to provide certified tax returns when requested for admission purposes shall result in rejection of the application; failure to provide certified copies during occupancy shall result in imposition of maximum surcharges upon the tenant/cooperator.

   (10) The waiting list shall be printed in a legible manner and shall be available for inspection by members of the Board of Directors, members of the Tenants Association, residents of the development, city officials and applicants. Both internal and external waiting lists must be posted in a format prescribed by HPD in the management office, or, if there is no management office, in the lobby of each building of the housing company development. Posted waiting lists shall exclude all personal information except for the first and last names of all active applicants. Names of applicants on such waiting lists shall appear in chronological order, by apartment size, by date of application receipt or by order of selection by lottery, as applicable.

   (11) If, at any time, an applicant's name has been omitted from a waiting list in error, and said applicant can present adequate documentation satisfactory to the housing company or its managing agent to substantiate an earlier date of application for an apartment, applicant's name shall be inserted into the waiting list in the corrected date order. Requests to be reinserted into the waiting list cannot be made more than seven years after the date of the initial application and must be submitted to HPD for prior written approval.

   (12) Except for the priorities mentioned below, the waiting list by apartment size in chronological order by date of receipt of application or order of selection by lottery, as applicable, shall be maintained in the following manner:

   (1) First priority. Tenant/cooperators currently residing in a development whose household composition renders them eligible for a smaller apartment shall be given first priority for an internal transfer. Tenant/cooperators currently residing in a development whose household composition renders them eligible for a larger apartment shall be given first priority for the first three out of every four apartments that become available and the fourth such apartment that becomes available shall be set aside and offered to an applicant on the external waiting list in accordance with the provisions contained in paragraph (3) of this subdivision. No priority shall be given to residents seeking additional apartments for members of their household, or for non-resident family members or any other parties. The housing company shall maintain an internal transfer list by apartment size, listed in chronological order by date of receipt of transfer request. If, at any time, a tenant/cooperator's name has been omitted from the internal transfer list in error, and said tenant/cooperator can present adequate documentation satisfactory to the housing company or its managing agent to substantiate an earlier request for a transfer, said tenant/cooperator's name shall be inserted into the internal list in the corrected date order. Insertions to the internal transfer list shall be submitted to HPD for prior written approval.

   A tenant/cooperator on an internal transfer list, whose household composition so changes as to render him or her ineligible for the apartment size requested, shall be placed on the appropriate size apartment list as of the date when the change occurred or the date the original request is made, whichever is later; provided, however, that, except for enlargement of a household due to birth or adoption, the change to a larger household composition must have occurred at least one year prior to placement on the internal transfer list. If a tenant/cooperator is offered an apartment as an internal transfer and he or she is no longer eligible for that size apartment due to a change in household composition, his or her name shall then be placed on the appropriate size apartment list as of the date when the change occurred which made him or her ineligible.

   The tenant/cooperator must meet the occupancy standards for the size apartment requested at the time that he or she places his or her name on the internal transfer list and must have been in residence for a period of no less than one year before he or she may request a transfer to a larger apartment. The income affidavit submitted by the tenant/cooperator on file with the housing company or its managing agent must reflect a sufficient number of occupants to warrant a transfer at the time of his or her request, as well as when an apartment is offered. The housing company or its managing agent shall deny a transfer to the tenant/cooperator if he or she fails to satisfy these requirements. No transfer request will be accepted based on pregnancy. No transfer of apartments shall be effected if the tenant/cooperator seeking the transfer is in arrears in rent/carrying charges, surcharges, capital assessments, submetering charges or any other fees or charges. The housing company shall advise the tenant/cooperator in writing of its denial of a request for transfer.

   The tenant/cooperator shall be required to pay a surcharge effective the first day of the month following his or her residency in the new apartment if his or her income exceeds the maximum allowable for that apartment.

   (2) Second priority. Pursuant to § 31(7) of the Private Housing Finance Law, preference in admission to a project with an open waiting list, as determined by HPD, shall be given to persons who are veterans as such term is defined pursuant to § 85 of the Civil Service Law or their surviving spouses, and for projects with a closed list, as determined by HPD, preference shall be given upon the opening of the waiting list to such veterans or surviving spouses that are selected in the lottery for such opened waiting list. This preference in admission shall only be provided to veterans or surviving spouses whose names appear on the waiting list as the applicants of record and who have identified themselves as the heads of household on their applications. The inclusion of a veteran or surviving spouse as a member of the household shall not entitle any other applicant of record to this preference in admission.

   (3) Third priority. Persons listed on the external waiting lists by apartment size in strict chronological order by date of receipt of application or order of selection by lottery, as applicable. Family members of a tenant/cooperator, whether or not members of the tenant/cooperator's household, shall not receive preferential treatment on the waiting lists.

   (4) The above priorities shall not be applicable to staff or student housing or to housing for the elderly or disabled except as such priorities apply within each special category. Preference in admission to any development or to such portion of any development which has been specifically designed for occupancy by elderly or disabled persons, as the case may be, shall be given to such persons.

(j) Application fee for rentals and mutual housing companies. A rental or mutual housing company development shall require a nonrefundable application fee of $75 at the time of submission of an application for an apartment, unless such a fee is not permitted by an applicable federal or state law. If an apartment is offered to an applicant and the applicant does not accept the apartment, the housing company may remove the applicant from the waiting list. A housing company shall not offer an applicant an apartment more than two times.

(k) Security deposit for purchase of cooperative shares. A mutual housing company may, at its option, require an applicant for a mutual housing company apartment to submit, along with his/her written acceptance of said apartment, a security deposit of up to one month's carrying charges which may be retained by the housing company and apportioned between the housing company and the outgoing cooperator to reimburse them respectively for their losses in the event the applicant withdraws his or her acceptance of the apartment.

(l) Verification of income at time of admission and during occupancy. 

   (1) Admission income verification. The housing company or its managing agent shall verify the aggregate income of each applicant and members of his or her household prior to admission to the development in the following manner:

      (i) Each applicant shall furnish an affidavit attesting to the gross household income of his or her household for the preceding year and the anticipated gross household income for the current year. All members of the household must be listed on the income affidavit whether or not income was earned.

      (ii) Each applicant and each member of the household having any income shall furnish proof of income by supplying copies of W-2 forms filed by them for the preceding year, or a statement from their employer setting forth their current rate of income and their total earned income for the immediately preceding year and a copy of their IRS or New York State income tax returns for the immediately preceding year. HPD or the housing company may require submission of certified income tax returns for admission purposes. Each self-employed applicant and self-employed member of the household who will reside with the applicant shall furnish a certified copy of his or her IRS and New York State income tax returns for the immediately preceding year. Applicants and members of the applicant's household shall pay the cost of obtaining certified copies of their income tax returns.

      (iii) A copy of amendments to any tax returns, or of tax assessments shall be furnished to the housing company within 30 days after filing the amendment or receipt of notice of the assessment.

      (iv) Additional proof of eligibility may be requested by the housing company or HPD.

   (2) Income verification during occupancy. During occupancy, a tenant/cooperator and members of his or her household shall submit when requested by the housing company, its managing agent or HPD certified copies of their IRS and/or New York State income tax returns for audit or verification purposes with regard to continued eligibility, surcharges or any other valid purpose. The tenant/cooperator and members of his or her household shall assume the cost of obtaining such certified copies.

   (3) Failure to provide certified income tax returns or other documentation. Failure to provide certified copies of income tax returns or other required documentation shall result in denial of admission to new applicants and imposition of the maximum surcharge to those already in occupancy.

(m) Occupancy standards.

   (1) Apartments shall be offered for occupancy as they become vacant in accordance with the standards set forth below (occupancy standards shall be applied without regard to the pending birth or pending adoption of a child):

      (i) Efficiency apartments (no bedrooms). One (1) or two (2) persons.

      (ii) One (1) bedroom apartments. Two (2) or three (3) persons shall occupy a one-bedroom apartment. A single person may occupy a one-bedroom apartment if the development has less than ten percent (10%) efficiency apartments.

      (iii) Two (2) bedroom apartments. No fewer than three persons, a brother and a sister who are both adults, or a parent or guardian with at least one child.

      (iv) Three (3) bedroom apartments. No fewer than (A) five (5) persons, (B) parent(s) or guardian(s) with two children of the opposite sex, (C) a household of three adults with one child where at least one adult is the parent or guardian of such child, or (D) a household of one parent or guardian and his or her three children shall occupy a three-bedroom apartment.

      (v) Four (4) bedroom apartments. No fewer than (6) persons.

      (vi) All apartments. In all cases the tenant/cooperator named on the lease must be at least eighteen years of age and must actually occupy the apartment as his or her primary residence.

      (vii) HPD may grant waivers of occupancy standards for medical reasons.

   (2) Except as otherwise provided by paragraph (1) of subdivision (i) of this section, priority shall be given to internal transfers in the offering of all vacant apartments.

(n) Lease and occupancy agreements. 

   (1) No tenant/cooperator shall be permitted to occupy an apartment until an executed lease or occupancy agreement has been approved by HPD. The minimum term of such lease or occupancy agreement shall be one year.

   (2) No tenant/cooperator shall have the right to sublet without prior written approval of HPD and the housing company, which only shall be given in exceptional circumstances, including, but not limited to, military service. No tenant/cooperator shall have the right to assign his or her lease/occupancy agreement.

   (3) No tenant/cooperator may accept any consideration or thing of value from a guest, invitee or other occupant in exchange for occupancy, whether temporary or permanent, unless such person is listed on the application, income affidavit or recertification of the tenant/cooperator and the tenant/cooperator continues to maintain the apartment as his or her primary residence.

   (4) It is required that the apartment of the tenant/cooperator be at initial occupancy and continue to be his or her primary place of residence. The facts and circumstances to be considered in determining whether a tenant/cooperator occupies a dwelling unit as his or her primary residence include, but are not limited to, whether such tenant/cooperator

      (i) specifies an address other than such dwelling unit as his or her place of residence or domicile in any tax return, motor vehicle registration, driver's license or other document filed with a public agency,

      (ii) gives an address other than such dwelling unit as his or her voting address,

      (iii) sublets or permits unauthorized persons to occupy the dwelling unit without written approval by HPD and the housing company or attempts to assign such dwelling unit, or

      (iv) spent less than an aggregate of one hundred eighty-three days in the preceding calendar year in the City at such dwelling unit (unless such individual is in active service in the armed forces of the United States or took occupancy at such dwelling unit during the preceding calendar year). However, no dwelling unit may be considered the primary residence of the tenant/cooperator unless the tenant/cooperator's name is listed on income documentation that must be sent by the tenant/cooperator to the Department or to any other governmental agencies (for example: income affidavits, re-certifications or Section 8 forms) for the most recent preceding year for which such documentation was required. No dwelling unit may be considered the primary residence of the tenant/cooperator unless the tenant/cooperator provides proof that he or she either filed a New York City Resident Income Tax return at the claimed primary residence for each year of residency for which such return should have been filed or that the tenant/cooperator was not legally obligated to file such tax return pursuant to § 1705(b)(1)(A) and § 1751(a) of the Administrative Code due to residency in a foreign country or pursuant to § 11-1751(a) of the Administrative Code and § 6-01 of the Tax Law because the tenant/cooperator's income for such year was below that required for the filing of a return or pursuant to § 893 or 894 of the Internal Revenue Code due to employment by a foreign government or international organization or due to any treaty obligation of the United States which applies to such taxpayer. The tenant/cooperator whose residency is being questioned will be obligated to provide proof that his or her apartment is his or her primary place of residence, including, but not limited to certified New York State income tax returns, utility bills, and voter registration data.

   (5) The terms and conditions of all licensing agreements and all tenancies, including tenancies of commercial and professional space, shall be subject to HPD written approval.

(o) Applicability of Section 235-f of the Real Property Law.

   (1) Definition of terms. Section 235-f of the Real Property Law of the State of New York shall apply to all housing companies, subject to the restrictions set forth in this section. As used in this subdivision (o), the term "occupant" shall mean a person, other than a tenant/cooperator, residing together with the tenant/cooperator in an apartment in a rental or mutual housing company development subject to these rules, who is not a party to the lease or occupancy agreement, including, but not limited to, a member of a tenant/cooperator's immediate family, whose occupancy has been approved by the housing company and HPD.

   (2) Admission and eligibility requirements for occupants.

      (i) No tenant/cooperator shall permit a person to "co-occupy" the tenant/cooperator's apartment without first obtaining the written approval of the housing company and/or HPD, except as specified in subdivision (p) of this section. Such approval shall be sought by the tenant/cooperator and the proposed occupant, submitting to the housing company through its managing agent the same financial information as is required to be submitted by any tenant/cooperator.

      (ii) The housing company and/or HPD may reject any proposed occupant:

         (A) For the same reasons that the housing company and/or HPD would reject the application of a person who applies to become a tenant/cooperator of a vacant apartment, provided that no rejection shall be based on the financial ability of a proposed occupant to pay the rent/carrying charge for the apartment if the tenant/cooperator has adequate financial ability to pay such rent/carrying charge; or

         (B) when the acceptance of a proposed occupant would result in the apartment being occupied contrary to the occupancy standards for apartments set forth in subdivision (m) of this section; or

         (C) when the acceptance of a proposed occupant would result in the apartment being occupied in violation of the income eligibility requirements of the Private Housing Finance Law or these rules, or

         (D) when the acceptance of a proposed occupant would violate the income eligibility or other occupancy standards or requirements of any other federal, state or city program applicable to such apartment.

   (3) Status of occupant.

      (i) No occupant, except as otherwise set forth in subdivision (p) of this section, shall have any rights under the lease/occupancy agreement for the apartment or to succeed to the rights of the tenant/cooperator, if the tenancy of the tenant/cooperator terminates. Acceptance by the housing company of full or partial payment of rent/carrying charges from an occupant, by check or otherwise, shall not give the occupant any rights of tenancy under the lease/occupancy agreement or otherwise.

      (ii) Each occupant shall be required to furnish to the housing company such financial and other information, on an annual or more frequent basis, that the tenant/cooperator is required to furnish to the housing company, in the form that the tenant/cooperator is required to furnish such information, including by affidavit. Where the rental or carrying charge for an apartment, or a rental surcharge, is based on the income of persons residing in the apartment, the income of the occupant shall be included in such com- putation.

      (iii) The tenant/cooperator and the occupant shall occupy the apartment as their primary residence, and the occupant shall represent his or her intention to do so prior to commencing occupancy.

(p) Occupancy rights of family members. 

   (1) The rights of family members of a tenant/cooperator who have requested to remain as the lawful tenant/cooperator are governed by policies and procedures set forth in this subdivision, except in those instances where this subdivision is preempted by the rules or regulations of other federal, state or city programs.

   (2) As used in this subdivision the following definitions shall apply:

      (i) "Tenant/Cooperator" shall mean any person named on a lease as a lessee or who is a party to a rental agreement or proprietary lease and obligated to pay rent or carrying charges for the use or occupancy of an apartment.

      (ii) "Family member" shall mean:

         (A) A husband, wife, son, daughter, stepson, stepdaughter, father, mother, stepfather, stepmother, brother, sister, nephew, niece, uncle, aunt, grandfather, grandmother, grandson, granddaughter, father-in-law, mother-in-law, son-in-law, or daughter-in-law of the tenant/cooperator.

         (B) Any other person residing with the tenant/cooperator in the apartment as a primary residence who can prove emotional and financial commitment and interdependence between such person and the tenant/cooperator. Although no single factor shall be determinative, evidence which is to be considered in determining whether such emotional and financial commitment and interdependence existed shall be the income affidavit filed by the tenant/cooperator for the apartment and other evidence which may include, without limitation, the following factors:

            (a) longevity of the relationship;

            (b) sharing of or relying upon each other for payment of household or family expenses, and/or other common necessities of life;

            (c) intermingling of finances as evidenced by, among other things, joint ownership of bank accounts, person and real property, credit cards, loan obligations, sharing a household budget for purposes of receiving government benefits, etc.;

            (d) engaging in family activities by jointly attending family functions, holidays and celebrations, social and recreational activities, etc.;

            (e) formalizing of legal obligations, intentions, and responsibilities to each other by such means as executing wills naming each other as executor and/or beneficiary, granting each other a power of attorney and/or conferring upon each other authority to make health care decisions each for the other, entering into a personal relationship contract, registering a domestic partnership pursuant to Executive Order No. 48, dated January 7, 1993 or Local Law No. 27 of 1998, serving as a representative payee for purposes of public benefits, or other such formalizations;

            (f) holding themselves out as family members to other family members, friends, members of the community or religious institutions, or society in general, through their words or actions;

            (g) regularly performing family functions, such as caring for each other or each other's extended family members, and/or relying upon each other for daily family services;

            (h) engaging in other patterns of behavior, or other action which evidences the intention of creating a long-term, emotionally committed relationship.

In no event shall evidence of a sexual relationship between such persons be required or considered.

      (iii) "Disabled person" shall mean a person who has an impairment which results from anatomical, physiological or psychological conditions, other than addiction to alcohol, gambling, or any controlled substance, which is demonstrable by medically acceptable clinical and laboratory diagnostic techniques and which is expected to be permanent and to substantially limit one or more of such person's major life activities.

      (iv) "Senior citizen" shall mean a person who is sixty-two (62) years of age or older.

   (3) Unless otherwise prohibited by occupancy restrictions based upon income limitations pursuant to federal, state or local law, regulations or other requirements of governmental agencies, if the tenant/cooperator has permanently vacated the apartment, any member of such tenant/cooperator's family, who has resided with the tenant/cooperator in the apartment as a primary residence, as determined by 28 RCNY § 3-02(n)(4), for a period of not less than two years immediately prior to the tenant/cooperator's permanent vacating of the apartment, and whose name is listed on any income documentation submitted by such tenant/cooperator to the Department or to any other governmental agencies (for example: income affidavits, re-certifications or Section 8 forms), for at least the two consecutive annual reporting periods immediately prior to the tenant/cooperator's permanent vacating of the apartment or where such person seeking succession rights is a senior citizen or disabled person, for a period of not less than one year immediately prior to the tenant/cooperator's permanent vacating of the apartment, and has appeared on such income documentation for at least the reporting period immediately prior to the permanent vacating of the apartment by the tenant/cooperator, or from the inception of the tenancy or commencement of the relationship if for less than such periods, and the apartment was and continues to be the primary residence of the member of the tenant/cooperator's family that resided with such tenant/cooperator, may request to be named as a tenant/cooperator on the lease and where applicable on the stock certificate. In the event that HPD has authorized the housing company not to collect surcharges based on income documentation, the family member shall be asked to provide other evidence of occupancy for the required period of time. The burden of proof is on said family member to show use of the apartment as his or her primary residence during the required period to be eligible to succeed to possession.

   (4) Family members do not have the right to succeed the tenant/cooperator in occupancy if the housing company terminates the tenancy of a tenant/cooperator for cause.

   (5) The minimum periods of required residency set forth in this section shall not be deemed to be interrupted by any period during which the family member who is seeking succession rights temporarily relocates because he or she:

      (i) is engaged in military duty;

      (ii) is enrolled as a full-time student, and the family member resided in the subject apartment as a primary residence (as determined pursuant to paragraph 4 of subdivision (n) of this section) for at least two years immediately prior to the family member's enrollment as a full-time student;

      (iii) is not in residence at the apartment pursuant to a court order not involving any terms or provisions of the lease/occupancy agreement, and not involving any grounds specified in the Real Property Actions and Proceedings Law;

      (iv) is engaged in employment requiring temporary relocation from the apartment;

      (v) is hospitalized temporarily for medical treatment; or

      (vi) has other reasonable grounds that shall be determined by HPD upon application by such person.

   (6) The housing company shall secure credible evidence of the tenant/cooperator's permanent removal from the apartment and the surrender of the apartment or the tenant/cooperator's written declaration to vacate the apartment prior to the consideration of re-letting or succession to the apartment by a family member.

      (i) Where a tenant/cooperator has died, the lease and shares of stock for such decedent's apartment shall be surrendered by the decedent's estate or survivors to the housing company.

      (i-1) When a member of a tenant/cooperator's family residing in the apartment as a primary residence as set forth in paragraph (3) of this subdivision is granted succession rights, the housing company shall transfer the shares, other value assigned to the apartment and/or the lease to said family member.

      (i-2) When there is no succession claim or a claimant is denied succession rights, and a legally recognized estate of the deceased tenant/cooperator requests the value of the shares and other value assigned to such decedent's apartment, the housing company shall remit such value, less any charges against such shares and other value that are permitted by this chapter, to such estate.

      (i-3) When there is no succession claim or a claimant is denied succession rights, and no legally recognized estate of the deceased tenant/cooperator makes a claim for the value of the shares and other value assigned to such decedent's apartment within one hundred twenty days of the death of said tenant/cooperator, such shares shall be transferred to the housing company and shall be offered for sale in accordance with this section. The housing company shall hold the value of such shares and other value assigned to such decedent's apartment, less any charges against such shares and other value that are permitted by this chapter, for a legally recognized estate until such time that a lawful claim for such is recognized in a court of law.

      (ii) If there is a legal dispute or claim involving who is rightfully entitled to the value of the shares, mortgage amortization and capital assessment contributions assigned to an apartment in a mutual housing company, such legal dispute or claim shall not affect the rights of such family members as set forth in paragraph (3) of this subdivision.

      (iii) If a court of law determines that someone other than such family members as set forth in paragraph (3) of this subdivision is entitled to the value of the shares, mortgage amortization and capital assessment contributions assigned to the apartment, such matter shall be resolved between such party and such successor family members without recourse to the housing company.

   (7) The housing company and/or HPD shall have the option of requiring any proposed successor to move to a smaller apartment in the development, in the event the apartment in question is or would become underoccupied according to occupancy standards set forth in subdivision (m) of this section.

   (8) Where a family member applies to the housing company for permission to remain in occupancy as a tenant/cooperator, the housing company shall act on the application within thirty (30) days of receipt by either requesting that HPD approve the application or by denying the application and notifying the applicant family members in writing of its determination.

      (i) In the event the housing company denies such application, the notice to the applicant shall set forth in writing the reasons why the evidence submitted was deemed inadequate and resulted in such denial and inform the applicant of the right to appeal and the method of appeal.

      (ii) A family member whose application to succeed to a lease or an occupancy agreement has been denied by a housing company may, within thirty (30) calendar days of receipt of the written denial, appeal to the Commissioner of HPD (hereinafter "Commissioner") or his or her designee. Such appeal shall include proof of service of a copy of such appeal upon the housing company. The appeal shall briefly set forth the reasons why the family member believes he or she is entitled to occupy the apartment and any errors or erroneous findings he or she believes are contained in the housing company's determination. The Commissioner or his or her designee shall review the housing company's determination and any additional information submitted by the applicant and shall issue the final agency decision with regard to the applicant's application. The only review of this determination is pursuant to Article 78 of the Civil Practice Law and Rules.

      (iii) Pending the agency's determination, the applicant may continue in occupancy and shall be required to pay for the use and occupancy of the apartment in an amount equal to the monthly rental/carrying charge paid by the vacating tenant/cooperator.

      (iv) In the event the agency determines that the applicant is ineligible to remain in occupancy then such applicant shall vacate the apartment or the housing company may seek to terminate the occupancy without any further approval by HPD.

   (9) This subdivision shall not apply to staff housing where employment at the institution is a primary requirement for residency. It shall also not apply to housing designated for senior citizens or the disabled, unless such succeeding family member would have qualified for an apartment as an original tenant.

(q) Payment of rent and deposit of security.

   (1) A rental housing company may require all new tenants to deposit as security an amount equal to a maximum of two months' rent, or such amount as may be approved by HPD at the time of signing the lease except where federal law or regulations prohibit. Commercial or professional tenants may be required to deposit as much rent as security as the housing company requires.

   (2) Each rental housing company is required to open an interest bearing bank account in accordance with § 7-103 of the General Obligations Law.

(r) Unauthorized payments. No company, associate, director, officer, employee, agent or other person shall solicit or receive, directly or indirectly, any commission, bonus, gratuity, fee or any other payment not expressly authorized by HPD from any person interested directly or indirectly, in the filing of an application or in obtaining a lease or occupancy agreement. Violation, in whole or in part, of Penal Law, § 180.55 by any agent, sub-agent, or employee of the agent is a crime and may be grounds for the cancellation of a sales or rental agreement or managing agent's agreement by HPD.

(a)  Income limitations.

   (1) The dwellings in a rental development shall be available for persons or families whose probable aggregate annual income at the time of admission and during the period of occupancy does not exceed the greater of (i) the median income for such persons or families for the New York City metropolitan statistical area or (ii) seven times the annual rental, including the value or cost of heat, light, water and cooking fuel, except that in the case of families with three or more dependents, such ratio shall not exceed eight times the annual rental.

(c) Surcharge procedures.

   (1) Surcharges shall be payable monthly on a current basis by tenant/cooperators in occupancy based upon income realized during the prior calendar year and such income shall be reported on income affidavits to be furnished by tenant/cooperators.

   (2) On February 15th of each year during occupancy, or at such other date as determined by HPD, the housing company shall distribute to each tenant/cooperator an affidavit to be executed by all occupants residing in the apartment as to the income realized by each of such occupants during the preceding calendar year. The information requested shall be set forth in a form of affidavit prescribed by HPD.

   (3) The tenant/cooperator shall return to the housing company or its managing agent the income affidavit supplied by the housing company duly executed and notarized by April 30th of each year.

   (4) The surcharges shall be computed by the housing company or its managing agent in sufficient time so that surcharge billings shall commence no later than July 1st of each year. The income affidavits will be subject to verification at any time, pursuant to such method as may be determined by HPD, including, but not limited to, spot check audits of certified income tax forms and verification by the New York State Department of Taxation and Finance as set forth in § 60(9) of the Private Housing Finance Law. Tenant/cooperators and other occupants selected for audit shall be required to provide a certified copy of the IRS or New York State income tax return for the audited year(s). The tenant/cooperators shall assume the cost of obtaining said certified copies. If HPD establishes a verification system with the New York State Department of Taxation and Finance, those tenant/cooperators found to have reporting discrepancies shall be obligated to furnish certified copies of IRS or New York State income tax returns. The housing company may, upon HPD's approval, implement a policy imposing a penalty fee when additional income is found that would have resulted in an additional surcharge.

   (5) A housing company or its designee is required to collect all surcharges computed on the basis of income received by all individuals in occupancy.

(d) General requirements.

   (1) In the event that a tenant/cooperator fails to return a fully completed affidavit by April 30th of each year, the income of such tenant/cooperator will be presumed to have exceeded the maximum allowable income by 150 percent or more. Written notice will be given informing such tenant/cooperator that the maximum surcharge will be imposed effective July 1st. In the event completed income affidavits are submitted after April 30th but prior to June 30th, the maximum surcharge will not be imposed. However a non-refundable administrative charge, payable to the housing company, will be applied. This charge cannot exceed $50.00. The housing company may remit half of any such charge collected to the managing agent to compensate for the additional administrative work.

   In the event fully completed income affidavits are submitted after June 30th, a correction to the maximum surcharge billing will be made effective the first day of the month following the submission of such income affidavit. However, a non-refundable administrative charge, payable to the housing company, will be applied. This charge cannot exceed $150.00 for each month after June 30th in which the tenant/cooperator has not submitted a fully completed income affidavit. This charge must be made payable to the housing company. The housing company may remit half of any such charge collected to the managing agent, in accordance with the terms of the applicable contract, to compensate for the additional administrative work. In extenuating circumstances, HPD may permit reimbursement of excess surcharge to the tenant/cooperator.

   For purposes of this paragraph, an income affidavit in which the tenant/cooperator's household income is not disclosed is not a fully completed income affidavit.

   (2) [Reserved.]

   (3) Whenever changes occur in rentals or carrying charges or any component thereof used in the computation of surcharges, surcharges shall be recalculated by the housing company or its managing agent.

   (4) A housing company cannot bring an eviction proceeding against any tenant/cooperator who fails or refuses to pay surcharges without the issuance of a certificate of eviction by HPD following an administrative hearing by an HPD designated hearing officer in accordance with 28 RCNY § 3-18.

   (5) Housing companies or their managing agents shall submit a copy of the surcharge information tabulation sheets, and all changes thereto, together with copies of the income affidavits for HPD review and evaluation. Surcharge records shall be kept available by the housing company or its managing agent for inspection by HPD.

   (6) Tenant/cooperators and other occupants shall be required by HPD to furnish certified copies of their IRS and New York State income tax returns. The cost for the certified report is to be borne by the tenant/cooperator.

(e) [Reserved.]

(f) Interim changes in income.

   (1) Where a tenant/cooperator anticipates a long-term reduction in income, resulting from death of a wage earner, retirement, or other such circumstances, said tenant/cooperator must submit documentation of such interim change in income to the managing agent. The managing agent shall verify the documentation submitted, and if a change in income is so determined, shall remove the surcharge and inform HPD of such action. HPD reserves the right to disapprove the action of the housing company.

   (2) Where a tenant/cooperator anticipates a temporary reduction in income, such as job loss, temporary illness, or other such circumstances, said tenant/cooperator must submit documentation of such temporary reduction in income to the managing agent. The managing agent shall verify the documentation submitted, and if the interim change in income is so determined, shall reduce, eliminate or defer collection of surcharges for a reasonable period of time or shall arrange for an extended payment plan.

   (3) The managing agent must maintain supporting documentation for all agreements which shall be available for review by HPD. Any tenant/cooperator shall have the right to appeal any determination under this subdivision (f) to HPD.

(g) Applicability of federal § 8 subsidy to tenant/cooperators in residence. Pursuant to § 31, subdivision 10 of the Private Housing Finance Law, a housing company shall accept federal reimbursement under § 8 of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1974, as amended, in lieu of such amount of rent/carrying charge payment for a person qualifying under such act. A housing company shall not reject an applicant for an apartment solely on the basis that all or part of the rent/carrying charges shall be paid under § 8 of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1974, as amended.

*§ 3-06 Resale of Cooperative Shares.* ::


(a)  Procedures.

   (1) A shareholder desiring to sell his or her shares in a mutual housing company shall notify the housing company in writing no later than 90 days in advance of his or her intention to sell his or her shares to the housing company or its designee, pursuant to the provisions of the housing company by-laws and occupancy agreement.

   (2) The shareholder shall transfer his or her shares to the housing company and shall thereafter surrender possession of the apartment at the agreed upon time pursuant to arrangements made with the housing company. After the shareholder has surrendered possession of the apartment, the housing company will inspect the apartment to determine necessary repairs. Any surcharge or any other fees and charges owing to the housing company shall be deducted from the equity due the cooperator.

   (3) The housing company shall enter the transfer of shares on its books.

   (4) The shareholder shall be responsible for carrying charges and submetered electrical charges for up to 90 days after surrendering possession of the apartment or until the housing company transfers the shares to the new owner, whichever occurs earlier.

   (5) (i) If a tenant/cooperator seeks to withdraw his or her offer of sale of shares, and no commitment has been made to a purchaser, the housing company at its option, may permit the tenant/cooperator to withdraw his or her offer, and may charge the tenant/cooperator a reasonable fee for this service.

      (ii) If, within an 18 month period, shares for the same apartment are re-offered for sale after a previous withdrawal pursuant to subparagraph (i) of this paragraph, the tenant/cooperator must post security for administrative costs in the amount of two months' carrying charges. If the shares for the apartment are sold, the security shall be refunded. If the shares for the apartment are withdrawn again, the security shall be forfeited.

   (6) The occupancy agreement for each mutual housing company shall set forth the obligations of each shareholder with respect to the condition of the unit at the time that such shareholder vacates the unit.

   (7) In the case of National Housing Act of 1937, as amended, § 223(f) refinanced mutual housing companies, where the appliances were included as security for the insured mortgage, the outgoing shareholder shall be required to leave behind the appliances which were in place at the time of refinancing or to replace them with appliances of equal size and amenities. In the case of non-refinanced mutual housing companies, a board of directors may adopt a uniform policy whereby either the incoming or outgoing cooperator shall be responsible for providing a stove and refrigerator for his or her apartment. A board may adopt a policy which apportions the cost of appliances between the incoming and outgoing shareholders as follows: As appliances require replacement, the cooperator in residence would be required to purchase the new appliance(s). A life-expectancy schedule would be established for each type of appliance and the appliance would be depreciated over that pre-determined time period. If the cooperator in residence vacated the apartment any time during the depreciation period, he or she would be reimbursed for the remainder of the period by the incoming cooperator. If the depreciation period were over when the cooperator vacated, the incoming cooperator would be obligated to purchase new appliances and the process would commence again. The depreciated appliances would become the property of the housing company. Any policy adopted must be applied uniformly to all apartments.

   (8) The mutual housing company shall follow the chronological order of its waiting list in the sale of shares. In the event a mutual housing company has substantially depleted its waiting list, the mutual housing company shall seek potential applicants.

(b) Resale price of shares.

   (1) The resale price of shares in a mutual housing company shall be fixed by the mutual housing company, subject to the approval of HPD and shall be equal to

      (ii) any capital assessments and voluntary capital contributions approved by HPD and paid by the selling tenant/cooperator to the mutual housing company, to the extent not already included in the consideration paid for such shares, and,

      (iii) if established by the mutual housing company, a proportionate share of the actual aggregate amortization paid on all existing and prior mortgages on the project in reduction of total outstanding principal indebtedness during such period as shall be fixed by the board of directors of the mutual housing company, to the extent not already included in the consideration paid for such shares, and

      (iv) reasonable non-refundable administrative charges, not to exceed $150. Said administrative charge is to be retained by the mutual housing company.

   (2) The aggregate amount to be paid to the selling tenant/cooperator with respect to the sale of the selling tenant/cooperator's shares shall be fixed by the board of directors of the mutual housing company, subject to the approval of HPD, and shall be equal to

To the extent that a selling tenant/cooperator may be entitled to an amount less than the resale price of his or her shares, the difference shall be retained by the mutual housing company.

   (3) The Board of Directors may, subject to the approval of HPD, establish a general policy pursuant to which a selling tenant/cooperator who had occupied more than one dwelling unit is paid an amount measured by his or her proportionate share of the actual aggregate amortization paid during his or her period of occupancy on all existing or prior mortgages on the project. To the extent that a selling tenant/cooperator may be entitled to an amount greater than the resale price of shares, the difference may be paid to the selling tenant/cooperator by the mutual housing company.

   (4) The "proportionate share of the actual aggregate amortization paid on all existing and prior mortgages on the project" referred to in paragraph (1) of subdivision (b) of this section shall be in the same ratio to such actual aggregate amortization as the number of shares held by the selling tenant/cooperator at the time of sale bears to the total number of shares of issued and outstanding capital stock of the mutual housing company during such period.

   (5) Nothing contained in this section shall prohibit the continued use of any method of calculating resale price adopted by a mutual housing company and approved by HPD prior to July 26, 1983.

   (a) such spouse either was an initial occupant of the applicable dwelling unit with such shareholder or was included in at least two of the income affidavits filed by such shareholder during the time period immediately preceding such shareholder's request to add the spouse as co-owner of shares and a co-signatory of such occupancy agreement;

   (b) such spouse has occupied the applicable dwelling unit as his or her primary residence for at least two consecutive years and continues to occupy such dwelling unit as his or her primary residence at the time of such request; and

   (c) such spouse and the shareholder intend in good faith to remain joint occupants of the applicable dwelling unit. Any spouse that becomes a co-owner of shares and a co-signer of the applicable occupancy agreement pursuant to these requirements also shall be considered a shareholder of record for such dwelling unit.

(d) Bequeathing of apartments. In no event may the right of occupancy in a Mitchell-Lama mutual housing company development be bequeathed to another. Upon the death of the tenant/cooperator, the shares must be returned to the mutual housing company which will arrange for a sale pursuant to subdivision (a) of this section.

The following is intended to serve as minimum requirements for housing companies in arranging an insurance program to provide protection against the usual hazards experienced during the course of operation. Since the same conditions may not prevail in all developments, separate studies should be made as to the actual exposures and hazards and the insurance coverage necessary to meet them. It is incumbent upon all housing companies to see that proper insurance coverage is maintained at all times and that coverages are modified or changed to meet changing conditions. Copies of all insurance policies and renewals shall be transmitted promptly to HPD. Furthermore, all insurance coverage that is maintained by housing companies must be issued by an insurance company in good standing licensed to issue insurance in New York State.

(b) Minimum required coverage.

   (1) Upon opening a corporate or sales office.

      (i) Public liability (Comprehensive General Liability Form) Minimum limits of $1,000,000 per occurrence, $2,000,000 annual aggregate for bodily injury and property damage.

      (ii) Workers' compensation. As required by statute.

      (iii) Disability benefits. As required by statute.

      (iv) Blanket fidelity bond. Appropriate limits as determined by HPD.

      (v) Hold up. Inside and outside. Money and securities. (Broad Form if possible where safe is located on premises.)

   (2) Upon acquisition of site.

      (i) Liability coverage. To be endorsed to include site and any buildings thereon.

      (ii) Fire insurance. Housing company should obtain this coverage on its buildings and/or personal property.

   (3) Upon commencement of construction of the limited-profit housing company development. The following coverages are generally supplied by the General Contractor pursuant to the terms of the construction contract. Contractors shall be required to submit the required policies delineated in this section to HPD before the commencement of any construction work and operations shall not be allowed to commence until coverage required has been approved by HPD.

      (i) Contractor's public and protective liability and property damage. Contractor shall provide such coverage to protect him and his subcontractors against claims for property damage and personal injury, including accidental death, in the sum of $1,000,000 per occurrence, $2,000,000 annual aggregate bodily injury and property damage.

      (ii) Owner's protective liability and property damage. Contractor shall provide such coverage to protect the housing company against claims for property damage and personal injury including accidental death caused by the operation of the contractor or his subcontractors during the performance of the work in the sum of $1,000,000 per occurrence, $2,000,000 annual aggregate bodily injury and property damage.

      (iii) Workers' compensation. As required by statute.

      (iv) Disability benefits. As required by statute.

      (v) Fire and extended coverage insurance. Pursuant to the terms of the Construction Contract. It is recommended that a builder's risk "Completed Value" form of policy be used. Adequate coverage shall be maintained for any materials which are stored away for the development site. It is recommended that the housing company rather than the contractor obtain this coverage.

      (vi) Boiler. Minimum of $1,000,000 pursuant to the terms of the Construction Contract. It is recommended that the housing company rather than the contractor obtain this coverage.

      (vii) Payment and performance bond. Pursuant to the terms of the Construction Contract.

   (4) Upon occupancy of buildings. Policies carried during the initial or construction periods of a housing development for which there is a continuing exposure thereafter may remain in force and the policies adjusted in accordance with requirements during later conditions.

      (i) Comprehensive general liability. Minimum limits of $1,000,000 per occurrence, $2,000,000 annual aggregate for bodily injury including accidental death and property damage. This policy should include coverage for the maintenance or use of the premises as well as for all elevators which are located in the development.

      (ii) All Risk Property Policy. Policy should be written in an amount equal to at least 90 percent of the insurable value of the development. The prior approval of HPD shall be obtained for a deductible clause in excess of $5,000. Fire policies shall contain a provision that the settlement of all fire losses shall be subject to the approval of HPD. Policies shall be endorsed to cover the interest of The City of New York, as first mortgagee.

      (iii) Rents. The rental income of the development should be written on a 100 percent co-insurance basis.

      (iv) Workers' compensation. As required by statute.

      (v) Disability benefits. As required by statute.

      (vi) Fidelity Bond. 3D Comprehensive form of policy is recommended for this coverage. The amount of the coverage shall be two and one-half times the value of the monthly rent roll plus any other fluid assets. However, in certain cases using the two and one-half times factor may make the amount of coverage unrealistic and the cost prohibitive for the risk involved. Therefore, HPD reserves the right to determine, on a case by case basis, what amount is sufficient. A rider should include coverage for a managing agent. Furthermore, for mutual housing companies, a rider can also be added to include the interest of all non-compensated officers, directors and committee members.

      (vii) Boiler and machinery. HPD recommends a "Comprehensive" form of coverage be used or a rider be added to the "Broad" form to cover "Miscellaneous Electrical Equipment". The amount of insurance to be carried shall be sufficient to cover the maximum probable damage to the property of the development and property of others that may arise out of any accident occurring through the operation of such equipment, but in any event not less than $1,000,000. Policies shall be endorsed to cover the interest of the City of New York, as first mortgagee.

      (viii) Directors and officers. For mutual housing companies. Minimum limit of $1,000,000.

      (ix) Umbrella liability. The minimum requirement for under 150 units $1,000,000; 151 to 500 units $5,000,000; 501 to 1,000 units $10,000,000; over 1,001 units $15,000,000.

      (x) Miscellaneous risks.

         (A) Automobiles. Any vehicle owned by the housing company shall be covered by automobile liability insurance with minimum limits of $250,000/500,000 for bodily injury, including accidental death, and at least $100,000 for property damage. For damage to the vehicle itself, comprehensive fire and theft shall be obtained. For automobiles owned by employees and officers of the housing company, used on behalf of the company, proper liability coverage shall be obtained with limits of $250,000/500,000 for bodily injury including accidental death and $100,000 for property damage.

         (B) Sales and management companies. Where the housing company employs independent sales or managing agents, these agents or their employees who are responsible for the handling of housing company monies shall, without expense to the company, be bonded by a Blanket Position Bond, in favor of the housing company and a copy of such Blanket Position Bond shall be submitted to HPD.

         (C) Contractors, concessionaires, and similar professionals. In the event that repair, alterations, exterminating or any other work or services shall be performed by the housing company, the housing company shall require that all firms performing such operations, supply evidence that workers' compensation and public liability insurance are in force. The limits for liability shall be at least $500,000 for bodily injury and property damage, combined single limit. It may be that certain contractors and concessionaires, by the nature of the liability factor for the work being done, and the cost of the contract, would have a higher risk factor. In that event we reserve the right to require, on a case by case basis, a higher amount for bodily injury. The housing company and HPD shall be named as an Additional Insured.

         (D) Commercial tenants and licensees. Must carry a minimum of $1,000,000 for bodily injury and property damage, combined single limit. It may be that certain commercial tenants and licensees, by the nature of their business, would have a higher bodily injury risk factor. In that event we reserve the right to require, on a case by case basis, a higher amount for bodily injury. The housing company and HPD shall be named as an Additional Insured.

         (E) Architects and engineers. Must furnish evidence of their liability coverage.

         (F) For subparagraphs (x)(C) and (x)(D) above, the housing company and HPD shall be named as an Additional Insured.

         (G) Insurance coverage shall be reviewed prior to the anniversary date of each policy with respect to the adequacy of coverage. HPD may direct a housing company to increase the amount of its coverage to reflect current replacement value where appro- priate.

(c) Notice of loss.

   (1) The housing company shall give immediate notice to HPD of the occurrence of any damage to its property caused by fire or any other hazards, whether or not covered under any of the above insurance coverages.

   (2) If damage to housing company property is sustained at other than normal business hours, the loss must be reported to HPD on the first regular business day following the occurrence.

   (3) Personal injury or fatality as a result of a fire or other than natural causes must be reported to HPD immediately.

   (4) In the event that a housing company decides to employ a Public Adjuster for the purpose of negotiating a settlement with its insurance company, the housing company must request approval from HPD in writing. Approval by HPD must be confirmed in writing to the housing company.

   (5) Unless HPD exercises its rights under the mortgage to apply insurance proceeds to the mortgage, all checks in payment of losses shall clear through HPD Insurance Unit. HPD representatives will inspect to see that the damaged property has been restored to satisfactory condition, after which time the checks shall be released to the housing company.

(d) Cancellation. All policies shall provide for a minimum of thirty (30) days notification to HPD in the event of cancellation, amendment or alteration of a policy.

(e) Capital grant insurance requirements.

   (1) The housing company shall cause to be placed and kept in force all forms of insurance needed to protect the company adequately or required by law, including but not limited to workers' compensation insurance, disability insurance, public liability, boiler insurance, and all risk property insurance. All of the various types of insurance coverage required for the benefit of the housing company shall be placed with such companies, in such amounts, and with such beneficial interest appearing therein as shall be acceptable to the housing company and the New York State Division of Housing and Community Renewal, and otherwise be in conformity with the requirements of the mortgage.

   (2) The housing company shall provide or make provision for a managing agent's bond naming the New York State Housing Finance Agency as obligee with an amount and an insurance company acceptable to the housing company, the New York State Housing Finance Agency, the New York State Division of Housing and Community Renewal and HPD.

(b) Public hearing requirement.

   (1) HPD shall hold a public hearing before acting upon any application or motion for an increase in the maximum rental/carrying charges per room to be charged tenant/cooperators of dwellings where HPD is the supervising agency under the provisions of the Private Housing Finance Law.

Such notice shall have annexed to it a copy of the application or motion for increase in rental/carrying charges and shall set forth the facts upon which the application or motion is based. A development assisted by a Federal Section 236 contract must also comply with Federal rent/carrying charge increase requirements.

   (2) No applications or motion for an increase in the maximum rental/carrying charges per room shall be entertained or acted upon hereunder for a period of two years from the date of any previous order of the supervising agency for the increase of maximum rental/carrying charges affecting the same dwelling.

   (3) In the event that a hearing having been scheduled is adjourned for any reason whatsoever, then notice of such adjourned date shall be posted near the elevators, on bulletin boards or in any other conspicuous places on the lobby floor; such notice shall constitute compliance with these regulations.

      (i) A housing company which desires to implement an increase in that portion of the rent/carrying charges attributable to utilities must make a request in writing to HPD for permission to do so. Accompanying said request must be photocopies of utility bills for the period of two years prior to the date of request in order to compare current costs with prior costs.

      (ii) The housing company must indicate the total annual amount of the increase requested and, in addition, indicate the amount of the increase on a per room per month basis.

      (iii) In the case of a mutual housing company, the utility increase request must be accompanied by a board of director's resolution approving same.

Additional copies of the request with back-up data shall be kept by the housing company for inspection by tenant/cooperators requesting same.

   (2) Procedure for processing increase. The above data will be analyzed by the Division of Housing Supervision of HPD to determine the validity of the request for a utility pass-through. Tenant/cooperators shall be allowed thirty (30) days from the date of notification to the shareholders or Tenants Association to comment on the request. Upon determination by HPD that a pass-through of increased utility costs is warranted, based on an increase in utility rates, an increase in utility consumption or any combination thereof, HPD shall approve implementation of said utility pass-through and shall notify the housing company in writing of such approval and of the duration of said utility pass-through. In a rental development, a copy of the approval letter shall be sent to the President of the Tenants Association. HPD may deny the request if the housing company has sufficient resources to absorb the increases.

   (3) Implementation by housing company.

      (i) A utility pass-through shall become effective on the first day of the month following the approval of same. The housing company shall notify the tenant/cooperators of such utility pass-through at least fifteen (15) days in advance thereof by either ordinary mail or distribution under each apartment door, and by posting a copy of the approval letter in a conspicuous public place on the lobby floor of each building affected; if such notice is not given in sufficient time, then the pass-through shall become effective on the first day of the next following month after such notice is given.

      (ii) A utility pass-through may be requested at any time that an increase in rates or usage occurs; however, no more than one (1) pass-through for the housing company will be approved by HPD for implementation within any six (6) month period.

(b) Submetering of electricity. Wherever allowable as determined by the Public Service Commission, a housing company which is master metered for electricity may, pursuant to HPD approval, install equipment for the submetering of electrical charges within dwelling units and bill tenant/cooperators for their individual consumption, plus administrative costs and amortization of equipment. A housing company seeking to convert to submetering must comply with all requirements of the Public Service Commission with respect to such conversion. Rent/carrying charges shall continue to reflect the cost of electricity for public areas and usages.

   (1) Submission of plans. The housing company shall submit to HPD for review and approval plans and specifications for the installation of submetering equipment.

   (2) Bidding requirements.

      (i) All contracts for the sub-metering of electricity shall be bid in accordance with 28 RCNY § 3-07.

      (ii) In the event that any director, officer, stockholder, employee or agent of any housing company shall be directly or indirectly connected with any person, firm, or corporation which may submit any bid, or to whom any contract is proposed or awarded, a statement setting forth the nature of such connection shall be included in the submission to HPD. In the case of a mutual housing company, it shall be made a part of the minutes.

   (3) Testing of submetering equipment.

      (i) The housing company shall be responsible for maintaining accurate meters. Periodic inspections shall be conducted for this purpose.

   (4) Grievance procedures. Grievance procedures prepared by the housing company relating to the submetering of electrical charges shall be submitted to HPD for review and approval before such procedures are implemented by the housing company.

(c) Direct metering of electricity.

   (2) The housing company shall submit to HPD for review, plans and specifications for installation of direct metering equipment. The bidding requirement set forth in 28 RCNY § 3-07 shall be complied with.

   (3) At the time of request by the housing company for permission to direct meter a development, a copy of the request shall be sent by ordinary mail to all tenant/cooperators.

   (4) Prior to any determination being made by HPD regarding the conversion to direct metering, HPD will solicit tenant/cooperator comments regarding said conversion.

   (5) A determination will be made by HPD after analysis of existing utility charges as to whether rents or carrying charges at the development require adjustment as a result of the conversion.






*§ 3-12 Energy Conservation. [Repealed]* ::


(a)  Written notice and opportunity to appear. In the event of a violation by a housing company which could result in removal of any or all of a Board of Directors pursuant to § 32(6) of the Private Housing Finance Law, the Board of Directors shall be provided with written notice and affected directors shall be given an opportunity to appear and be heard before HPD with respect to any alleged violations.

(b) Representation by counsel. The respective parties may be represented by counsel before HPD.

(c) Appointment of replacement board of directors. Pursuant to § 32(6) of the Private Housing Finance Law, HPD may replace any or all members of a Board of Directors by appointing persons who HPD in its sole discretion deems advisable, including officers or employees of HPD, as new directors to serve in the places of those removed. Directors so appointed need not be shareholders or meet other qualifications which may be prescribed by the housing company's Certificate of Incorporation or by-laws.

(d) Term of appointment. Directors appointed under this section shall serve only for a period coexistent with the duration of the violation, or until HPD is assured against commitment of violations of a similar nature, and shall serve in such capacity without compensation.

(e) Debarment. Any person or entity may be debarred for a period not to exceed ten years from contracting with or managing any housing companies supervised by HPD upon a finding by a hearing officer designated by the Commissioner that there has been a material violation of these rules or the provisions of Article II of the Private Housing Finance Law by such person or entity or their agent or agents or upon a finding by a hearing officer designated by the Commissioner that they have engaged in activity which would constitute a violation of the Penal Law. Any person or entity so debarred may appeal in writing to the Commissioner within ninety days of written notification of the debarment.

(f) Control of admissions and transfers. Upon a finding that any housing company is in violation of these rules with respect to admissions and transfers, HPD may take over control of all internal and external waiting lists and have sole responsibility for the selection and approval of admissions and transfers.

(g) Compulsory training. HPD may at its discretion require managing agent employees and members of the board of directors to attend housing education courses at the respective expense of the managing agent and the housing company.






*§ 3-14 Corporate Action.* ::


(a)  Certificates of incorporation, by-laws, rules and regulations. Each housing company shall file with HPD, for its approval, a certified and acknowledged copy of its proposed by-laws. Each housing company shall also file with HPD, for its approval, a certified and acknowledged copy of all proposed amendments to its certificate of incorporation or by-laws. The housing company shall forward to HPD for its files two copies of the by-laws or amendments to the certificate of incorporation or by-laws subsequent to HPD approval. Failure to seek HPD approval or rejection by HPD of the by-laws or amendments to the certificate of incorporation or by-laws will render the by-laws or such amendments null and void. Certificates of incorporation, by-laws, rules and regulations established by a housing company shall be in conformity with state laws and HPD rules. Housing company certificates of incorporation, by-laws, rules and regulations to the contrary shall be deemed null and void.

(b) Disposition of housing company property. No personal property, books, financial or other records of a housing company shall be destroyed or disposed of without the written consent of HPD.

(c) Salaries, fees or other compensation to officers or directors. No housing company shall pay any salaries, fees or any other form of compensation to any officer or director for services rendered in his or her capacity as corporate officer.

(d) Responsibilities of Board of Directors.

   (1) Members of the Board of Directors of a housing company, whether rental or mutual housing company, bear a high public responsibility, since they have elected to operate under a City-aided program to effectuate public policy by encouraging the building and operating of housing developments for families of moderate income.

   (2) Board members have a fiduciary responsibility to the shareholders of the corporation. Each board member must ensure that buildings, grounds and other assets are kept up to high standards so that their value is not impaired and that the annual operating revenue is spent effectively and economically.

   (3) Board members must exercise judicious control of the premises entrusted in their care, including community rooms and public spaces.

   (4) Members of the Board of Directors have an obligation to provide to tenant/cooperators the most economical operation of the development without endangering the long term interest of the project.

   (5) Board members should be aware of and responsive to tenant/cooperator grievances.

   (6) Upon HPD's request, the housing company shall submit to HPD a copy of the minutes from the relevant meeting, certified as to correctness by the housing company's secretary.

   (7) No board member shall receive any preferential treatment or thing of value as a result of his or her board membership.

   (8) Members or officers of the Board of Directors must occupy a dwelling unit at the mutual housing company development represented by such Board of Directors as his or her primary place of residence.

(e) Duties and powers. The Board of Directors has the responsibility for establishing policy covering administration of property, interests, business and transactions of the corporation and may delegate to officers such authority as it deems necessary. Sound organizational policy dictates that individual members of the Board should not interfere with day-to-day management and operation of the project or with its employees or intrude upon management functions. Failure to adhere to this policy reduces the efficiency of the operating staff by creating conflicts in control and in the chain of command. However, the Board as a whole is obligated to ensure that the day-to-day operations of the housing company are handled in the most efficient and expeditious manner and nothing herein should be construed to reduce that responsibility.

(f) Capital assessments by a mutual housing company.

   (1) Capital assessments. A mutual housing company may, by vote of its directors followed by a vote of the shareholders, assess all shareholders on an equitable basis in order to undertake a program of major capital improvements or major repairs approved by HPD. A mutual housing company must obtain a majority of votes at a meeting of shareholders for this purpose and obtain HPD's approval for the assessment.

   (2) Proceeds of capital assessments. The proceeds of capital assessments shall be deposited in a blocked bank account and all withdrawals from such account shall be subject to the written approval of HPD. Any surplus remaining in the account upon completion of HPD approved repairs or improvements shall be added to the reserve fund.

   (3) Approval process. A request for approval of a capital assessment shall be submitted in writing to HPD, and shall specifically indicate the type of capital improvements or repairs required, along with an estimate of probable cost and the timetable for completion of the proposed program. Contracts for completion of the program shall be subject to the appropriate provisions of HPD rules [;and regulations];, and shall include a provision that the acceptance of all work is subject to the approval of HPD.

(g) Conflicts of interest prohibited in mutual housing companies. No officer or member of the Board of Directors or their immediate family:

   (1) shall be or become interested directly or indirectly in any manner whatsoever in any business dealing with the mutual housing company except for resale of shares of their own apartments.

   (2) shall act as attorney, accountant, managing agent, broker or employee for any person, firm or corporation interested directly or indirectly in any manner whatsoever in business dealings with the mutual housing company;

   (3) shall accept any valuable gift, whether in the form of service, employment, loan, thing or promise, or any other form from any person, firm or corporation which to his or her knowledge, is interested directly or indirectly, in any manner whatsoever, in business dealings with the mutual housing company, its managing agent or any affiliates thereof.

   (4) Any deviation from the above requires prior written approval of HPD.

(h) Annual meetings and elections.

   (1) The Board of Directors of a mutual housing company shall hold regular meetings for the conduct of business. In addition, an annual meeting for the election of directors shall be held at a time and place, and in the manner prescribed by the mutual housing company's by-laws.

   (2) (i) All elections of directors for a mutual housing company that has not been refinanced under Section 223(f) of the National Housing Act must be supervised by an independent election company or the mutual housing company's attorney and/or accountant. No fewer than forty-five (45) days prior to conducting the election, the mutual housing company must submit to HPD in writing (A) the name of the independent election company and the proposed independent election company agreement, or, alternatively, with the approval of HPD, the name of the housing company's attorney and/or accountant who will be supervising the election, (B) a written description of the procedures for the nomination of directors and for the intended election, and (C) drafts of all other documents related to the election.

      (ii) No election may be conducted without the prior written approval of HPD of the submission made pursuant to subparagraph (i) of this paragraph.

(i) Voluntary dissolution.

   (1) Subdivisions two and three of section 35 of the Private Housing Finance Law, with respect to City-aided limited-profit housing companies, provides as follows: "A company aided by a loan made after [;May 1, 1959]; may voluntarily be dissolved, without the consent of [;HPD];, not less than twenty [;(20)]; years after the occupancy date upon payment in full of the remaining balance of principal and interest due and unpaid upon the mortgage or mortgages and of any and all expenses incurred in effecting such voluntary dissolution. Upon such dissolution, title to the project may be conveyed in fee to the owner or owners of its capital stock or to any corporation designated by it or them for the purpose, or the company may be reconstituted pursuant to appropriate laws relating to the formation and conduct of corporations, provided, however, that prior to any such dissolution and conveyance or reconstitution, payment shall be made of all current operating expenses, taxes, indebtedness and all accrued interest thereon and the par value of and accrued dividends on the outstanding stock of such company. If after making such payments, and after conveyance of the project, a surplus remains in the treasury of the company, such surplus . . . shall upon dissolution, be paid into the general fund of the [;City of New York];. After such dissolution and conveyance, or such reconstitution, the provisions of [;Article II of the Private Housing Finance Law]; shall become and be inapplicable to any such project and its owner or owners and any tax exemption granted with respect to such project pursuant to [;§ 33 of the Private Housing Finance Law]; shall cease and terminate."

All such documents shall also be given to the Tenants Association as well as to a management office on site (or, if there is no management office on site, to a management office located within the city of New York). At such management office, such documents shall be made available to any tenant of such rental housing company and/or his or her representative upon request.

If the public information meeting is outside the community district in which the housing company is located, the owner must provide transportation for tenants. Such public information meeting shall be held not less than 10 nor more than 20 days after service of the Notice upon the parties set forth above.

   (4) Public information meeting for Rental Companies. Pursuant to the Notice as specified above, the rental housing company shall conduct at least one public information meeting with the tenants. At such meeting representatives of the rental housing company shall inform the tenants of the rental housing company's intention to dissolve and/or reconstitute; the rental housing company's removal from HPD's jurisdiction and, if applicable, its subsequent registration with the New York State Division of Housing and Community Renewal (DHCR) for the purpose of rent stabilization pursuant to the applicable DHCR rules and regulations; whether rent stabilization will be applicable; prospective changes in ownership and any other relevant information regarding future plans for the rental housing company affecting the tenants.

Such written feasibility study will be distributed to each shareholder no later than sixty days after its preparation is completed, unless the by-laws of the company mandate a greater affirmative vote. Each dwelling unit shall be entitled to one vote regardless of the number of shares allocated to such dwelling unit, the number of shareholders holding such shares, or the provisions regarding voting in such mutual housing company's certificate of incorporation or by-laws. Said resolution shall include language as follows:

      "This resolution authorizes the board of directors to take steps necessary to prepare a written feasibility study that shall compare (i) remaining a mutual housing company (ii) dissolving and reconstituting as a private cooperative corporation organized pursuant to the Business Corporation Law, or (iii) dissolving and reconstituting as an Article XI housing development fund company organized pursuant to Article XI of the Private Housing Finance Law. Such written feasibility study will be distributed to each shareholder no later than sixty days after its preparation is completed. This resolution authorizes the expenditure of $_________ for such study, and notifies the shareholders that there are Private Housing Finance Law requirements for dissolution and/or reconstitution. This resolution also advises the shareholders that any additional expenditure of funds for such study will require a separate shareholder approval in accordance with the same voting procedures and cannot exceed $100,000 at any one time, and that the New York State Department of Law requirements must be met prior to actual dissolution and/or reconstitution."

      A certified copy of the resolution shall be submitted to HPD within seven (7) business days after such vote. Expenditure of funds authorized above shall require prior written approval of HPD.

   (9) Waiting list notifications. Both rental and mutual housing companies shall submit an affidavit certifying that each applicant on such housing company's apartment waiting list has been advised in writing of the proposed dissolution and/or reconstitution and that fees have been returned to said applicants prior to dissolution and/or reconstitution. Further, the affidavit shall state that any funds unreturned for lack of proper address or other technicality shall be escrowed and returned upon applicant's request.

   (10) Payment of mortgage(s) and other indebtedness by rental and mutual housing companies. On the date set for dissolution and/or reconstitution and mortgage prepayment, the housing company shall submit to HPD payment in a form approved by HPD for all principal, interest, supervisory fees, surcharges, amounts payable pursuant to residual receipt notes and any other amounts which may be owing to the City of New York, including any surplus due to be paid into the general fund of the City pursuant to Private Housing Finance Law Article II, § 35(3).

      (i) At least sixty (60) days prior to the date set for dissolution and/or reconstitution and mortgage prepayment, a schedule of all accounts payable, taxes due and any other indebtedness, including the par value and accrued dividends on outstanding stock (or, in the case of a partnership, accrued distributions) shall be submitted to HPD for its review and written approval; said schedule to be prepared and certified to HPD by an independent certified public accountant acceptable to HPD. Such schedule shall contain a listing of all items of indebtedness, the amount thereof, the source of payment thereof and the anticipated date of payment, plus the amount of money anticipated to be paid to the City from the remaining surplus.

      (ii) Accounts payable may include monies owed on executed contracts for repairs or capital improvements, subject to HPD approval. Any contract for capital improvement or repair work in an amount in excess of $15,000 executed within ninety (90) days prior to submission of a Notice of Intent to dissolve and/or reconstitute other than contracts for projects subject to HUD supervision must have a statement attached to the contract submission, sent to HPD for approval, advising HPD that the housing company is contemplating dissolution and/or reconstitution at the time of said submission of the contract. Failure to submit such contracts may result in exclusion of their cost in calculating surplus.

      (iii) No legal and accounting fees or other costs in a rental development associated with dissolution and/or reconstitution shall be charged to the housing company.

      (iv) Where applicable, the housing company shall submit evidence of payment of any relevant mortgages.

   (14) Terminology Used by Mutual Housing Company. Whenever a mutual housing company uses the term "dissolution," it shall include reconstitution where such housing company elects to reconstitute upon dissolution of such housing company. Furthermore, where the mutual housing company's board or the sponsor of a cooperative conversion of a mutual housing company represents in its cooperative offering plan or other documents that such mutual housing company is amending and/or restating its certificate of incorporation and/or that the shareholders will be voting on a voluntary reconstitution and conversion from a limited-profit mutual housing company to a private cooperative or to a housing development fund company in accordance with paragraph fifteen of this subdivision, section 35 of the Private Housing Finance Law designates these actions as a dissolution and reconstitution of the former limited-profit housing company cooperative.

   (15) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this subdivision, for the purposes of dissolving and reconstituting a mutual housing company as a housing development fund company (organized pursuant to Article XI of the Private Housing Finance Law) that will enter into a thirty-year regulatory agreement with HPD, the following shall apply:

Eligible voters for purposes of a quorum and for the vote shall be persons named on the stock certificate. No fewer than two-thirds of the dwelling units in such mutual housing company must approve such proxy statement in order for such dissolution and reconstitution to proceed and every dwelling unit shall be entitled to one vote, regardless of the number of shares allocated to such dwelling unit, the number of shareholders holding such shares, or the provisions regarding voting in such mutual housing company's certificate of incorporation or by-laws;

      (vi) the independent election company that conducts the special meeting pursuant to subparagraph (v) herein must certify the results of the shareholder vote to HPD as well as prove that the requirements of such subparagraph (v) for such special meeting have been met.

      (vii) within seven days of receipt of HPD's letter of authorization or within such reasonable time period as HPD has otherwise provided in writing, the mutual housing company shall send a written notice to each cooperator by ordinary mail or by distribution under each apartment door ("Effective Date Notice"), which provides the following:

         (A) the proxy statement has been approved by at least two-thirds of the dwelling units and the requisite voting procedures were followed;

         (B) the procedures by which cooperators who wish to dissent can exercise the option of becoming rental tenants of the housing development fund company by providing such mutual housing company with an affidavit of intent to forego participating in the plan of dissolution and reconstitution within thirty days of receipt of the Effective Date Notice, and

         (C) the mutual housing company shall submit an effectiveness amendment to the Attorney General, which shall include as exhibits HPD's letter of authorization and the Effective Date Notice, within thirty days of such Effective Date Notice. After the Attorney General's acceptance of the effectiveness amendment, HPD shall request that the City Council approve a real property tax exemption for such reconstituted housing development fund company in accordance with Section 577 of the Private Housing Finance Law on substantially the same terms as the prior real property tax exemption that had been issued pursuant to Section 33 of the Private Housing Finance Law;

      (viii) within six months after the City Council has approved such real property tax exemption or within such reasonable time period as HPD has otherwise approved in writing, the mutual housing company shall set the date upon which it shall be reconstituted as a housing development fund company ("Reconstitution Date").

         (A) provide participating shareholders with their propriety leases and such housing development fund company's corporate documents, including, but not limited to, its by-laws; and

         (B) provide dissenting shareholders the return on their initial equity investment in the former mutual housing company and market-rate rental leases for their dwelling units.

      (x) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this paragraph, the Reconstitution Date shall be within twelve months from the first day of the proposed first year of operation of the housing development fund company, provided, however, that if HPD, in consultation with the Attorney General, has approved in writing a Reconstitution Date in accordance with subparagraph (viii) of this paragraph that is more than twelve months from the first day of the proposed first year of operation of the housing development fund company, such mutual housing company shall file an amendment to the proxy statement that was circulated to the cooperators in accordance with subparagraph (iv) of this paragraph.

(j) Proxies, Direct Mail Ballots and Absentee Ballots.

   (1) With HPD's approval, a mutual housing company may require a standard form and procedure for the casting of proxies or absentee ballots in any matter requiring a shareholder vote.

   (2) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, in any vote conducted pursuant to paragraphs six-a, seven or fifteen of subdivision (i) of this section, voting by proxy shall not be permitted. However, HPD may approve, in writing, a standard form direct mail ballot for transmission to the independent election company engaged to conduct any votes pursuant to paragraphs six-a, seven or fifteen of subdivision (i) of this section. Such standard form of direct mail ballot shall be invalidated by the shareholder executing such ballot if such shareholder appears to vote in person in any vote conducted pursuant to paragraphs six-a, seven or fifteen of subdivision (i) of this section.

(f) Transfers of interests. All transfers of general partnership interests are subject to the prior written approval of HPD. HPD may require, as a condition of admission or substitution of general partners all such information regarding any proposed new general partner as it deems necessary.

Site managers employed by the prospective agent must be certified, by an organization acceptable to HPD, within twelve (12) months after assignment to an HPD-supervised housing development. The certification requirement cannot be waived by transferring the site manager to an alternate HPD-supervised site prior to the end of the twelve month period. If a housing company elects to undertake self-management of its housing development, it must seek written approval from HPD. The person being employed to perform the role of manager must be approved in writing by HPD. If the manager is an employee of the housing company, he or she is not obligated to have a real estate broker's license. However, the employee-manager must be certified, by an organization acceptable to HPD, within twelve (12) months after his or her initial employment date.

   (2) The agent must provide a fidelity bond in an amount and form and with a surety approved by HPD.

   (3) The agent shall provide evidence of experience and capability commensurate with the responsibility it seeks to undertake.

   (4) The agent may be required to submit a management plan proposing a program conducive to proper maintenance and economic viability of the project, and to harmonious relations among tenant/cooperators, management and the community. The plan shall include, but shall not be limited to, policy regarding deployment of personnel, tenant/cooperator-management relations, tenant/cooperator selection, rent/carrying charge collection procedures, agency reporting procedures, fiscal accountability, physical plant maintenance, equal opportunity measures and security measures. The plan shall take into account the characteristics of the development, its neighborhood and type of tenancy (e.g., senior citizen or handicapped). The plan and its implementation will be considered in determining the agent's employment, renewal and compensation, and will be subject to HPD review and written approval.

   (5) The agent must maintain an office or place of business in the metropolitan area at no cost to the housing company where it will keep all books, records, bills and other documents pertaining to the housing company. These records will be available for inspection and review by the owner, HPD or other interested parties as permitted by statute or rules of HPD.

(c) Term of managing agent's agreement.

   (1) Any managing agent's agreement shall be in a form approved by HPD and shall be of no force or effect until the contract has been approved in writing by HPD.

   (2) All new managing agent's agreements shall have a term of one (1) year commencing July 1st and terminating on June 30th of the following year. All renewals shall have a similar one (1) year term; provided, however that if a new managing agent agreement commences after July 1st, it still shall terminate on the June 30th following the commencement of such agreement.

   (3) Managing agent agreement renewals must be submitted to HPD for written approval.

   (4) Any managing agent's agreement shall provide that it is subject to termination without cause upon thirty (30) days written notice by the housing company or HPD. HPD or the housing company shall have the right to immediately terminate any managing agent for cause.

   (5) Promptly upon any termination, the managing agent shall turn over to the housing company, all project records, rent rolls, bills, cancelled checks, bank statements, bank books, waiting lists, correspondence, ledgers and all other documents related to or owned by the housing company.

   (6) HPD may review the performance of a managing agent at any time and may solicit comments from owners, tenants, and others relating to the performance of the managing agent.

(d) Managing agent's fee.

   (1) The managing agent's fee will be negotiated by the housing company and will be subject to approval by HPD.

   (2) The fee may be further adjusted on a compound basis by a percentage to be established annually by HPD, said percentage may be subject to negotiation by the housing company, but may not exceed the maximum percentage authorized by HPD.

   (3) If a new managing agent enters into an agreement with a housing company to replace an existing agent at a development, the maximum fee which can be paid to the new agent will be the fee established for the prior agent, plus any cumulative percentages adjustments which have been approved by HPD, regardless of whether the prior agent was given said increases. The new agreement is subject to negotiation by the housing company within the maximum established above.

   (4) If, upon evaluation by HPD, it is determined that an agent's performance has not been satisfactory during the prior year, the agent shall not be entitled to the annual increase in its fee. In its evaluation, HPD will consider comments from the housing company and the Tenants Association but will make the final determination regarding the increase. HPD will advise the housing company in writing at least 30 days prior to the agreement renewal date each year if approval of the annual increase is being withheld and the reasons therefor.

   (5) An approved annual increase in the managing agent's fee will become effective on July 1st of each year.

   (6) In the event a newly constructed development goes into occupancy, the managing agent's fee shall be negotiated by the housing company, but in no event shall it exceed the highest fee plus cumulative increases for a development of comparable size and nature already in existence within the program. Comparability will be determined solely by HPD.

   (7) If HPD disapproves an annual increase for a managing agent, HPD may within a reasonable period of time meet with the representatives of the housing company and the managing agent to discuss the reasons for HPD's dissatisfaction. The managing agent shall take such steps as deemed necessary by HPD to satisfy HPD requirements. If the agent's performance remains unsatisfactory, HPD may, upon notice to the housing company, terminate the managing agent's agreement.

*§ 3-17 Housing Company Responsibilities to Tenant/Cooperators.* ::


(a)  Tenants Association.

   (1) All rental housing companies shall recognize a duly constituted Tenants Association that will be representative of the tenant body as a whole.

   (2) A Tenants Association shall be duly constituted when a petition is signed by tenants representing no less than forty (40%) percent of the dwelling units. A group seeking recognition on the basis of such petition must submit the original petition to HPD and a copy to the housing company, and must arrange for the posting of a notice in each building of the development advising the other tenants of their intention to seek recognition. If HPD determines that the proposed group has been duly constituted, it will advise the housing company in writing of its decision to recognize the group. In the event other tenants representing no less than forty (40%) percent of the dwelling units in the development seek recognition of an alternative group, the housing company shall provide for an election to determine which shall be the duly constituted Tenants Association. In such an election each dwelling unit in the development shall be accorded one vote.

   (3) Upon recognition of a Tenants Association, an election of officers must be held and the names of the officers of said association shall be furnished to HPD.

   (4) HPD reserves the right to review and approve the by-laws and constitution of a Tenants Association.

   (5) Members or officers of the Tenants Association must occupy a dwelling unit at the rental housing company development represented by such Tenants Association as his or her primary place of residence.

(b) Availability of housing company records.

   (1) The rental housing company shall provide the Tenants Association with copies of operating budgets and financial statements of the housing company within 30 days after said documents are filed with HPD.

   (2) In a rental development which does not have a duly constituted and recognized Tenants Association, the rental housing company shall maintain copies of the operating budget and financial reports in the management office on site. If there is no office on site, the documents shall be made available upon request.

   (3) Any tenant/cooperator or any Tenants Association's duly authorized representative may audit the books of the housing company during normal business hours and shall have access to the financial records upon which such financial statement is based.

   (4) In a mutual housing company, the operating budget and financial statements shall be supplied to all shareholders.

(c) Consultation. The housing company or its duly authorized representative shall meet on a regular basis with representatives of a Tenants Association to discuss matters relating to the development. Such meeting shall take place at the development at a time mutually convenient to the Tenants Association and the housing company, and shall be held on a monthly basis unless the Tenants Association chooses to meet on a less frequent basis.

(d) Availability of community space. The housing company or its managing agent shall not unreasonably withhold permission for use of the development's community space from its residents. A reasonable charge may be made for janitorial or related services. A deposit may be required for the use of the space which is refundable if the premises is free of acts of vandalism. The housing company shall, in consultation with the Tenants Association, establish priorities for the use of the community space. If other organizations of tenants exist within a housing development, such as, for example, a senior citizen's club or garden club, the housing company through its managing agent, should make every effort to accommodate the needs of these organizations by providing an opportunity for use of the community space available. While the Tenants Association has first priority with regard to meeting space, it should not be to the exclusion of all other tenant organizations in the development. There is no obligation for the housing company to make community space available for fund-raising events or for organizations whose membership consists primarily of non-tenants. The use of the community room for these purposes should be at the discretion of the housing company in consultation with the Tenants Association.

(e) Bedbug Disclosure Notification. In accordance with Administrative Code § 27-2018.1, all rental and mutual housing companies must provide notice to each tenant/cooperator signing a vacancy lease or occupancy agreement of the project's previous year's bedbug infestation history. Such notice must be in a form approved by the Department.






*§ 3-18 Lease Termination and Renewals.* ::


(a)  Preliminary notice of grounds of eviction, administrative hearing and certificate of eviction. Except as otherwise provided in this subdivision, no eviction proceeding based upon a holdover or a breach of the terms of the lease or occupancy agreement shall be initiated by a housing company against a residential tenant/cooperator without the issuance of a certificate of eviction by HPD following an administrative hearing by an HPD designated hearing officer. The hearing officer's decision shall be final without recourse to an administrative appeal. Notwithstanding the foregoing, such hearing and certificate of eviction shall not be required for any eviction proceeding based upon non-payment of rent/carrying charges or any sum which constitutes rent or additional rent pursuant to the applicable lease or occupancy agreement. Furthermore, at HPD's sole discretion, such hearing and certificate of eviction may be waived in accordance with subdivision (e) of this section. To set an eviction hearing the housing company shall notify HPD in writing of the facts which it contends justify eviction, together with an affidavit stating that a preliminary notice of grounds for eviction has been served upon the tenant/cooperator as follows:

   (1) The notice shall be sent to the tenant/cooperator by regular first class mail, and by certified or registered mail, return receipt requested; and

   (2) A copy of the notice shall also be served by personal delivery to the tenant/cooperator; or by delivery to a person of suitable age and discretion occupying the apartment in question; or if admittance cannot be obtained and such person cannot be found, by affixing a copy upon the door or placing a copy under the door of the apartment.

   (3) The notice may be served simultaneously with any notice to cure which may be required by the tenant/cooperator's lease/occupancy agreement, and shall advise the tenant/cooperator of the following:

      (i) The specific charges against him or her;

      (ii) that he or she has the opportunity to appear before an HPD hearing officer to deny or explain the charges against him or her;

      (iii) that he or she may retain counsel to represent him or her at a hearing;

      (iv) that the findings of the HPD hearing officer, should a hearing take place, may be determinative as to the factual issues.

(b) Administrative hearing. If, after ten days from the date of service of the preliminary notice of grounds for eviction, the tenant/cooperator has not cured the breach of his or her lease/occupancy agreement, the housing company may request HPD to proceed to schedule a hearing at which the housing company shall present to the hearing officer its charges against the tenant/cooperator. The housing company shall advise the tenant/cooperator of the date and place of the hearing in the same manner prescribed for the service of the preliminary notice of grounds for eviction as specified in paragraphs one and two of subdivision (a) of this section. If the tenant/cooperator fails to appear at the designated hearing, he/she shall be advised by the hearing officer, by regular first class mail, that unless a request to reopen the matter is received by the hearing officer within a designated period of time, a decision shall be rendered by the hearing officer based upon the information provided by the housing company and that such decision shall be final. All witnesses at the hearing shall be sworn to tell the truth. Witnesses may be examined and cross-examined by either party and by the hearing officer. The hearing officer may accept any evidence which he or she deems to be relevant and material. A tape recording of the hearing shall be made by the hearing officer, and the hearing officer shall arrange for a transcript of the tape upon the written request of either party, at the expense of the party requesting said transcript. In the event the hearing officer finds grounds for the eviction, he or she shall issue a certificate authorizing the housing company to commence summary proceedings for such eviction of the tenant/cooperator, stating the reasons for his or her decision. At the soll discretion of the hearing officer, such decision may also contain a probationary period or opportunity to cure. A copy of said certificate shall be sent to the tenant/cooperator and to his or her attorney, if any, by regular first class mail. Service of process for summary proceedings may be made simultaneously with or subsequent to the service of such certificate. Acceptance of rent/carrying charges after the commencement of eviction proceedings, pursuant to the administrative hearing process, shall be without prejudice. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this subdivision (b), a breach of lease or occupancy agreement involving hazardous conditions, violent or disruptive behavior, fraud or illegality shall not be subject to any opportunity to cure by the tenant/cooperator.

(c) Appeals. There is no administrative appeal from the determination of the hearing officer. The decision of the hearing officer is subject only to review by commencing an action pursuant to Article 78 of the Civil Practice Law and Rules.

(d) Summary proceedings. The above procedures do not apply to summary proceedings for non-payment of rent, carrying charges and any other monetary obligations of the tenant/cooperator to the housing company pursuant to his or her lease or occupancy agreement or any other agreement between the tenant/cooperator and the housing company with respect to ancillary services, except as specified in subdivision (a) of this section.

(e) Emergency evictions. The above procedures may be waived at the sole discretion of HPD in any case in which HPD determines that the health or safety of the tenant/cooperators of a development is jeopardized by another tenant/cooperator or his or her family, members of his or her household or visitors to his or her premises.

(f) Applicability. The above procedures shall be the sole requirements to commencement of eviction proceedings and it is the express intention of HPD that no other section of these rules is applicable.

(g) Lease/occupancy agreement renewals. The housing company shall offer a renewal of a tenant/cooperator's lease/occupancy agreement between ninety (90) and one hundred twenty (120) days prior to the expiration of his or her existing lease/occupancy agreement, unless the tenant/cooperator shall have materially breached the lease/occupancy agreement, shall be ineligible for continued occupancy of his or her apartment, or shall otherwise be found to be a nuisance. Such renewal lease/occupancy agreement shall be for a minimum of a one-year term. If a housing company wishes to refuse to renew a tenant/cooperator's lease/occupancy agreement, it shall notify the tenant/cooperator with respect to its reason for refusing to renew in a notice to be served upon the tenant/cooperator in the same manner prescribed with respect to the preliminary notice of grounds for eviction between ninety (90) days and one hundred twenty (120) days prior to the expiration of his or her existing lease/occupancy agreement. A copy of said notice shall be sent to HPD. If the tenant/cooperator holds over subsequent to the expiration date of his or her lease, the housing company shall commence eviction proceedings against the tenant/cooperator in accordance with the administrative hearing process set forth in this section, unless the material breach of lease relates to non-payment of rent/carrying charges or additional rent/carrying charges as set forth in subdivision (a) of this section.

(h) Illegal occupancy. A housing company having knowledge of occupancy of an apartment in conflict with the requirements of the Private Housing Finance Law, HPD rules or the requirements applicable to the apartment by reason of any federal, state or city benefit or subsidy, lease or occupancy agreement, or by reason of any other applicable law or regulation, shall notify HPD in writing of said illegal occupancy. The housing company shall, as soon as practicable, commence eviction proceedings against the last-authorized tenant/cooperator of the apartment in accordance with the administrative hearing process set forth in this section. An illegal occupant of an apartment shall not be entitled to any protections pursuant to this section. A housing company shall not knowingly accept rent from an illegal occupant, and shall seek to recover from such occupant the full market value of the apartment. The acceptance of rent/carrying charges from or on behalf of an illegal occupant shall not be deemed to create any right of tenancy or any obligation on the part of the housing company to afford such person the protection which these rules afford to authorized tenant/cooperators.






*§ 3-19 Senior Citizen Rent Increase Exemption Program ("SCRIE").* ::


(a)  Background and applicability. Local Law No. 40 of 1976 (§§ 26-601 et seq.) amended the Administrative Code of the City of New York in order to establish an exemption from rent increases for senior citizens who meet the eligibility requirements specified therein, and who reside in a dwelling unit whose rent is regulated or established pursuant to the provisions of Articles II, IV, V or XI of the Private Housing Finance Law. Amendments to the law in 1977 and 1978 made dwelling units in a dwelling subject to or initially subject to a mortgage insured by the federal government pursuant to § 213 of the National Housing Act (12 U.S.C. § 1715e) eligible for the exemption. The Administrative Code was subsequently further amended to include increases in charges due to capital assessments and voluntary capital contributions within the definition of "increase in maximum rent," and to require that rent increase exemptions and tax abatements granted for such assessments and contributions be paid back by the tenant/shareholder to the housing company, and by the housing company to the City, upon transfer of shares. The amendment regarding capital assessments specifically excluded any dwelling unit subject to a mortgage insured or initially insured by the federal government pursuant to § 213 of the National Housing Act, as amended (12 U.S.C. § 1715e). Subdivision (g) of 28 RCNY § 3-19 implements the amendment to the Administrative Code. The rules set forth in this section implement Administrative Code §§ 26-601 et seq., and are applicable as provided therein. In addition, an amendment was passed on September 6, 1977 to allow portability for senior citizens receiving a subsidy under the rent and rehabilitation law, the rent stabilization law and Local Law 40 of 1976. Portability means that a senior citizen with a valid SCRIE subsidy may move within a development, and in addition, certificates issued by the Department for the Aging and HPD are interchangeable under conditions set forth in the law.

(b) Eligibility requirements.

   (1) The head of household or spouse is 62 years of age or older.

   (2) The total disposable income of all members of the household when combined does not exceed the amount provided for in RPTL § 467-c(1)(d).

   (3) The increase in maximum rent or carrying charges resulted in the maximum rent or carrying charge equalling or exceeding one-third of the combined disposable income of all members of the household. That portion of a rent or carrying charge increase attributable to gas or electrical utility charges or an increase in dwelling space, services or equipment is excluded from exemption.

   (4) The head of household is not receiving any other rent subsidies other than public assistance.

(c) Procedures.

   (1) A head of household may apply to HPD for a SCRIE subsidy on a form prescribed and made available by HPD. In addition to the application, he or she must submit any other documentation necessary to assist HPD in its review.

   (2) HPD shall review the application and shall notify the applicant of its determi- nation.

   (3) When HPD determines that an applicant is eligible, HPD shall advise both the eligible senior citizen and the housing company of the established base rent which the housing company is to charge the senior citizen. The established base rent shall remain the same until a change in circumstance occurs.

   (4) Senior citizens receiving benefits under this program must complete an annual recertification form prescribed and made available by HPD.

   (5) The effective date of the SCRIE subsidy for applications received by HPD not more than 120 days from the date of the increase shall be the effective date of the increase. The effective date of the SCRIE subsidy for all other applications shall be the first day of the month following the receipt of the application and shall be based only upon the most recent increase in maximum rent.

   (6) It shall be illegal for a housing company to collect any amount for which a SCRIE subsidy provides credit or to withhold benefits from a tenant/cooperator entitled to a SCRIE subsidy and collection or retention of any such amount for a dwelling unit occupied by such eligible head of household shall be deemed a rent overcharge. Upon conviction therefor, the housing company and its directors and any employee responsible therefor, shall be guilty of a misdemeanor, punishable by a fine not to exceed one thousand dollars or imprisonment not to exceed six months, or both.

(d) Reimbursement to housing companies.

   (1) On a quarterly basis, HPD will issue Tax Abatement Certificates to all housing companies which have extended benefits to senior citizens deemed eligible by HPD. The certificates will be in an amount equal to the difference between the approved rent/carrying charges for the dwelling units and the amount of the established base rents charged to the eligible senior citizens.

   (2) The housing company, upon receipt of the Tax Abatement Certificate, shall submit the certificate with the next quarterly real estate tax bill to the Department of Finance, paying the amount of the bill less the credit for the amount on the Tax Abatement Certificate. In those instances, where the taxes to be paid are less than the amount to be abated, HPD shall issue a voucher to the housing company for the balance.

   (4) HPD, at its discretion, may electronically notify the Department of Finance of the abatement amount in lieu of the issuance of a Tax Abatement Certificate.

   (5) If an audit or other means of verification discloses that an exemption is excessive, the amount of tax payable by reason of such disclosure and the statutory penalty thereon, shall be a lien upon the property as of the due date of the tax for which the excessive exemption was claimed. In the event the excessive exemption was not due to any willful fault of the housing company, the amount of tax payable by reason of the disclosure shall be a lien upon the property as of the date for payment of taxes next following certification of such corrected order by HPD.

(f) Portability of benefits.

   (1) When a head of household receiving a SCRIE subsidy moves his or her principal residence to another dwelling unit eligible under this program, the head of household may apply to HPD for a SCRIE subsidy relating to the subsequent dwelling unit which shall provide that the head of household shall be exempt from paying that portion of the maximum rent for the subsequent dwelling unit which is the least of the following:

      (i) The amount by which the rent for the subsequent dwelling unit exceeds the established base rent actually required to be paid in the original dwelling unit;

      (ii) the amount of rent abated in the most recent month in the original dwelling unit; or

      (iii) the amount by which the maximum rent of the subsequent dwelling unit exceeds one-third of the continued income of all members of the household.

In addition to submission of the application form and portability request, proof of income and proof of previous rent and subsidy are required.

      (ii) In addition to the application, a head of household must submit any other documentation necessary to assist HPD in its review.

   (3) HPD shall review the application and any supporting documentation to determine the eligibility of the head of household. HPD shall approve or disapprove applications, and, if it approves, shall issue a written notification to such head of household and to the affected housing company indicating the total amount of SCRIE subsidy available pursuant to this subdivision. If the application is disapproved, HPD shall issue a written notification of disapproval to such head of household indicating the reasons for the disapproval.

   (4) Upon receipt of notification of eligibility, the housing company shall provide the decrease in charges applicable to the capital assessment or voluntary capital contribution, and HPD shall reimburse the affected housing company in accordance with the procedures provided in subdivision (d) of this section in an amount equal to the total capital assessment or capital contribution.

   (5) i) Documentation of imposition of a capital assessment or voluntary capital contribution shall be provided by the affected housing company to HPD, in addition to any further information required by HPD to make a determination of eligibility under this subdivision.

      (ii) The affected housing company shall be entitled to deduct from the amount to be paid to such eligible head of household for the sale of such shares all amounts previously covered by a SCRIE subsidy which are attributable to a capital assessment or voluntary capital contribution. Where there is a transfer of shares through succession rights and where the successor is not entitled to a SCRIE subsidy under this subdivision, the affected housing company shall be entitled to receive a payment from the successor in an amount equal to all SCRIE subsidies attributable to a capital assessment or voluntary capital contribution.

      (iii) Such housing company shall not approve the transfer of shares unless it has received the payment required by subparagraph (ii) of this paragraph, or made the deduction therein authorized.

      (iv) Payment by such housing company of the amount attributable to the capital assessment or voluntary capital contribution set forth in subparagraph (ii) of this subdivision shall be made to the Department of Finance through an adjustment in tax abatement status issued to the Department of Finance by HPD, or by remittance by such housing company of such amount directly to the Department of Finance and written notification to HPD of such payment by the housing company within 90 days of the collection thereof. Payments due to the City in accordance with this subparagraph shall be deemed a tax lien and may be enforced in any manner authorized for the collection of delinquent taxes on real property.

   (7) The provisions of this section shall be applicable to an application pursuant to this subdivision except where in conflict with this subdivision, in which case, the provisions of this subdivision shall control.

Such housing companies remain subject to the provisions of the Private Housing Finance Law and the rules and regulations governing city-aided limited profit housing companies, except as provided otherwise by agreement with, or regulations of, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD). In general, all matters involving management, maintenance, and operation shall be supervised by HUD except as otherwise set forth by statute or in this section. Compliance with the requirements of the Private Housing Finance Law shall continue to be supervised by HPD. To the extent that HUD should relinquish authority over matters such as rent setting and management supervision, those responsibilities shall revert back to HPD.

Refinanced housing companies shall not be required, however, to submit applications to HPD for its prior approval. Instead, a post-audit of applications shall be conducted by HPD. Notwithstanding the foregoing, HPD reserves the right, where violations of law or of HPD rules are found, to reinstitute temporarily or permanently, a requirement of prior review and approval of all applications for admission to or transfer within a development. In addition, HPD and/or the housing company shall conduct income verification audits periodically either as a result of a spot check or other procedures. Tenant/cooperators and members of their household selected for audit shall be required to provide certified copies of IRS or New York State income tax returns, as requested and shall assume the cost of such copies. In refinanced housing companies which have "236" mortgage interest subsidy contracts, the housing companies are required to meet HUD income limits, where they differ from HPD, and any other federal law or regulation which may apply unless they are violative of New York State laws. HPD rules must be met regarding such things as waiting lists and submission of rent rolls. HUD does not prescribe the form of waiting list for "236" developments. If a "236" housing company maintains a single bound waiting list in chronological order, it shall also be required to maintain lists by bedroom size in chronological order for HPD.

The housing company or managing agent shall notify HPD, HDC and the Tenants Association of any litigation by or against the housing company which would have a material effect upon the financial condition of the housing company.

   (3) Deregulation of units.

      (i) With respect to a dwelling unit in any building receiving benefits under the Act,

         (A) such unit shall remain subject to rent regulation until the occurrence of the first vacancy after tax benefits are no longer being received for the building at which time the unit shall be deregulated, unless the unit is otherwise subject to rent regulation; or

         (B) if each lease and renewal thereof for such unit for the tenant in residence at the time of the expiration of the tax benefits has included a notice in at least twelve point type informing such tenant that the unit shall become subject to deregulation upon the expiration of the tax benefits and stating the approximate date on which tax benefits are to expire, such dwelling unit shall be deregulated after tax benefits are no longer being received for the building, unless the unit is otherwise subject to rent regulation.

      (iii) Rent regulation of dwelling units shall not be exempted or terminated other than as set forth in this subdivision (f) as long as benefits are in force.

   (4) Permanent residential use. All dwelling units must be leased for permanent residential purposes for a term of not less than one year so long as tax benefits are in effect. Permanent residential use shall not include use as a hotel, dormitory, employee residence or facility, fraternity or sorority house, resort housing or any similar type of non-permanent housing. For purposes of this chapter, a "hotel" shall mean (i) any Class B multiple dwelling, as such term is defined in the Multiple Dwelling Law, (ii) any structure or part thereof containing living or sleeping accommodations which is used or intended to be used for transient occupancy, (iii) any apartment hotel or transient hotel as defined in the Zoning Resolution, or (iv) any structure or part thereof which is used to provide short term rentals or owned or leased by an entity engaged in the business of providing short term rentals. For purposes of this definition, a lease, sublease, license or any other form of rental agreement for a period of less than six months shall be deemed to be a short term rental. Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) a structure or part thereof owned or leased by a not-for-profit corporation for the purpose of providing governmentally funded emergency housing shall not be considered a hotel for purposes of this chapter, and (ii) benefits may be pro-rated by deducting out work attributable to Class B units in a building containing both Class A and Class B units, provided that all units in a building are registered with DHCR as rent stabilized or rent controlled units, and are utilized for permanent residential use.

   (5) Escalation clauses in leases. Except for the notice referred to in subparagraph (i)(B) above, no lease for dwelling units which are registered with DHCR shall contain escalation clauses for real estate taxes or any other provisions for increasing the rent set forth in the lease, other than permitting an increase in rent pursuant to an order of DHCR or the Rent Guidelines Board.

   (6) Partial waiver of rent adjustments attributable to major capital improvements.

      (i) As a requirement for claiming or receiving any tax abatement attributable to a major capital improvement, the owner of the property shall file with the Office, on the date any application for benefits is made, a declaration stating that in consideration of any tax abatement benefits which may be received pursuant to such application for alterations or improvements constituting a major capital improvement, such owner agrees to waive the collection of a portion of the total annual amount of any rent adjustment attributable to such major capital improvement which may be granted by DHCR pursuant to the rent stabilization code equal to one-half of the total annual amount of the tax abatement benefits which the property receives pursuant to such application with respect to such alterations or improvements. For example, an owner receiving a total rent adjustment over eighty-four months equal to $100,000 for a major capital improvement along with tax abatement of $100,000 for the same improvement would waive collection of $50,000 during such period. Such waiver shall commence on the date of the first collection of such rent adjustment, provided that, in the event that such tax abatement benefits were received prior to such first collection, the amount waived shall be increased to account for such tax abatement benefits so received. The entire amount shall be applied against the first annual rent adjustment, including any retroactive rent adjustments which may be granted by the applicable DHCR order, unless the amount exceeds such adjustments, in which event the excess shall be carried forward. The calculation of the amount attributable to the waiver shall be against the total rent adjustment for the eighty-four month period prior to the application of any annual percentage limitation applied by DHCR to defer collection of the total rent adjustment. In calculating rental adjustments pursuant to Rent Guidelines Board orders the amount of the waived rent shall not be included in the base rent. Following the expiration of a tax abatement for alterations or improvements constituting a major capital improvement for which a rent adjustment has been granted by DHCR, the owner may collect the full amount of annual rent permitted pursuant to such rent adjustment. A copy of such declaration shall be filed simultaneously with DHCR. Such declaration shall be binding upon such owner, and his or her successors and assigns.

      (ii) The provisions of subparagraph (i) shall not apply to substantial rehabilitation of buildings vacant when alterations or improvements are commenced or to buildings rehabilitated with substantial governmental assistance.

(g) Eligibility rules for Cooperatives and Condominiums.

   (1) Buildings owned as Cooperatives or Condominiums are eligible for tax exemption pursuant to the Act, provided that the work is eligible pursuant to 28 RCNY § 5-03(a).

         (E) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this subparagraph (iv), the availability of any benefits pursuant to the Act to any multiple dwelling, Building or structure owned and operated by a Limited Profit Housing Company or a Redevelopment Company shall not be conditioned upon the Actual Assessed Value of such multiple dwelling, Building or structure, including land, as calculated as an average dollar amount per dwelling unit, at the time of Commencement of Construction, provided, that such Limited Profit Housing Company or Redevelopment Company (1) is organized and operating as a Mutual Company or a Mutual Redevelopment Company, respectively, (2) continues to be organized and operated as a Mutual Company or a Mutual Redevelopment Company, respectively, and to own and operate the multiple dwelling, Building or structure receiving such benefits, and (3) has entered into a binding and irrevocable agreement with the commissioner of housing of the state of New York, the Supervising Agency, the New York city housing development corporation, or the New York state housing finance agency prohibiting, respectively, either (A) the dissolution or reconstitution of such Limited Profit Housing Company pursuant to section thirty-five of the Private Housing Finance Law for not less than fifteen years from the date of commencement of such benefits, or (B) the dissolution or reconstitution of such Redevelopment Company pursuant to section one hundred twenty-three of the Private Housing Finance Law until the earlier to occur of fifteen years from the date of commencement of such benefits, or the expiration of any tax exemption granted to such Redevelopment Company pursuant to section one hundred twenty-five of the Private Housing Finance Law.

For applications for which a Certificate of Occupancy has not been issued within one year of the date of submission of such application for all units for which benefits are claimed: If a search by the Department of Housing Preservation and Development dated no earlier than ninety days prior to the date of submission of such application indicates that there are any violations of record which are classified as hazardous or immediately hazardous, the applicant must either clear the violations of record or submit affidavits:

      (ii) from the owner, certifying that the architect or engineer has inspected the premises and that work necessary to remove any hazardous or immediately hazardous violations has been completed. If a violation classified as hazardous or immediately hazardous was caused by a tenant and the tenant refuses to grant access to the applicant to correct the tenant-related violation, such violation will not preclude eligibility provided the applicant can establish these facts with clear and convincing evidence.

   (7) Applications for benefits pursuant to 28 RCNY §§ 5-03(a)(2), (3) or (4) must provide proof of compliance with the relocation requirements of § 11-243(z) of the Act.

(e) Additional documentation for certain alterations or improvements. Certain alterations and improvements require the approval of designated agencies and such additional documentation as the Office shall require. The "Schedule of Required Information, Permits and Sign-offs" set forth in 28 RCNY § 5-09 contains a list of the documentation that the Office requires for specific alterations and improvements.

(f) Filing Fees.

Upon notification of a determination of reasonable cost in excess of ten thousand dollars ($10,000) and prior to issuance of the Certificate of Reasonable Cost, the applicant must pay an additional fee in an amount equal to one percent (1%) of the reasonable cost in excess of ten thousand dollars ($10,000).

In the event a check is returned unpaid, the applicant shall be assessed a fifty dollar ($50) processing fee and all further payments with respect to the application shall be made by certified or cashier's check.

(f-1) BLDS Inspections. Except as otherwise provided in Section 489 of the Real Property Tax Law, Section 11-243 of the Administrative Code or these Rules, the filing of an application for a Certificate of Eligibility and Reasonable Cost is deemed a representation by such applicant that, with respect to all items of work claimed in such application, there has been Completion of Construction. Unless the aggregate cost of the items of work claimed in such application is less than ten thousand dollars ($10,000) or a designated special application form has been submitted in accordance with subparagraph (iv) of paragraph two of subdivision (c) of this section, all such items of work are subject to a BLDS Inspection prior to HPD's issuance of a Certificate of Eligibility and Reasonable Cost. Any Certificate of Eligibility and Reasonable Cost issued with respect to such application shall not include items of work claimed therein where, as determined by such BLDS Inspection, there has not been Completion of Construction.

(g) Issuance of a certificate of eligibility.

   (1) The Office shall review each application to determine if it is eligible for tax benefits in accordance with the provisions of these rules and the Act. The Office will inform an applicant if the file is incomplete; however, it is the applicant's responsibility to complete the application within twenty-four months of the initial filing date as provided in 28 RCNY § 5-03(d)(5). Provided, however, that for projects carried out with substantial governmental assistance and which have received a Temporary Certificate of Eligibility, the applicant must complete the application within one year of the completion of construction.

   (2) The certified reasonable cost for all eligible items of work shall be calculated as follows:

      (i) The certified reasonable cost for all eligible items of work shall be the lesser of the applicant's actual cost, or the allowance set forth in the Itemized Cost Breakdown Schedule.

      (ii) The certified reasonable cost for all eligible items of work shall be reduced where such items are allocable in whole or part to, or service, ineligible portions of the building, if any, in the same ratio as the ineligible space bears to the aggregate floor area of the building.

      (iii) For buildings eligible for enriched abatement as provided in 28 RCNY § 5-06(c)(1) the total certified reasonable cost shall not exceed the lesser of the owner's total actual expenditure or one hundred fifty percent (150%) of the total of the Itemized Cost Breakdown Schedule amounts set forth in 28 RCNY § 5-08.

      (iv) For buildings subject to the dollar limit set forth in 28 RCNY § 5-06(d), the aggregate certified reasonable cost may not exceed the maximum eligible CRC set forth therein.

      (v) [Repealed.]

   (3) The Office shall issue a Certificate of Eligibility and Reasonable Cost for all approved applications. Failure to produce satisfactory supporting documentation of the cost of an alteration, improvement or conversion, or any part thereof, or any of the items specified in this chapter may result in the denial of a Certificate of Eligibility and Reasonable Cost.

*§ 5-07 Revocation of Tax Exemption/Tax Abatement for Failure to Substantiate Claimed Costs and Declaratory Rulings.* ::


(a) [Reserved.]

(b) [Reserved.]

(c) [Reserved.]

(d) [Reserved.]

(e) Revocation or reduction of tax exemption and tax abatement for failure to substantiate claimed costs. All applications are subject to post-audit by HPD.

   (1) In addition to the basis for revocation of tax benefits provided in chapter thirty-nine of this title, the Commissioner may reduce or revoke past or future tax exemption or tax abatement if he or she finds that the application for tax exemption or tax abatement, including all affidavits submitted in connection with the application, contains a false statement or false information as to a material matter or omits a material matter relating to claimed costs. It is the responsibility of the recipient of the benefits, whether the original applicant or any subsequent owner, including any condominium or cooperative, to document all claimed costs in a manner acceptable to HPD and in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards so that original checks or such other proof of payment as the Office shall require can be properly matched against the items on the Itemized Cost Breakdown Schedule and so that the auditors may examine original documentation for the cost of all supplies and the cost of all subcontracts. If a recipient of tax benefits hereunder fails to substantiate claimed costs to the satisfaction of HPD, the CRC shall be reduced or revoked as applicable. In the event that HPD determines on the basis of the total available evidence that the application contains a false statement or false information as to a material matter, or omits a material matter, relating to claimed costs, all benefits hereunder shall be revoked.

   (2) Tax benefits will not be revoked for failure to substantiate the amount of claimed costs after the expiration of six years from the later of the date of the approval of the Certificate of Eligibility and Reasonable Cost as stated therein or the date upon which the tax benefits commence, except that (1) where an audit has been initiated within the six-year period, but a final determination has not been rendered, or (2) where the applicant has not made payment in full for the work comprising the project within two years after the applicant has collected the Certificate of Eligibility, then such benefits may be revoked subsequent to such six year period.

   (3) All books, records and documents, which in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards, may be used to substantiate entries in the applicant's books and records relating to claimed costs, shall be kept at all times available for inspection by the Office and shall be retained for a period of at least six years from the later of the date of the approval of the Certificate of Eligibility and Reasonable Cost as stated therein or the date upon which the tax benefits commence except that (1) where an audit has been initiated and a final determination has not been rendered, such records shall be retained until such determination has been made and (2) where an applicant has entered into an installment arrangement with respect to payment for work comprising all or a part of the project, such records shall be retained until the later of (i) three years from the date on which the applicant collects the Certificate of Eligibility and Reasonable Cost, and (ii) one year following payment in full for the work comprising the project.

   (4) If an institutional lender has become a successor in interest to the original owner of such building or structure, and, after diligent efforts to obtain original contracts, checks and other records normally reviewed by the Office to verify claimed costs, is unable to obtain part or all of such records, the Office shall permit the substitution, in whole or in part, of documentation certified by the institutional lender showing the amounts advanced by the institutional lender pursuant to the mortgage loan to finance such alterations or improvements along with such other documentation as the Office may require.

   (5) The revocation of tax exemption and/or abatement for failure to substantiate claimed costs hereunder shall be conducted in accordance with the procedures established pursuant to chapter thirty-nine of this title. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if, after HPD delivers an Initial Notice in accordance with chapter thirty-nine of this title, the Taxpayer fails to submit documentation to substantiate claimed costs during the Comment Period as defined in such Initial Notice, HPD shall deliver a Determination Notice to the Taxpayer in accordance with such chapter.

(f) [Reserved.]

(g) [Reserved.]

(h) [Reserved.]

(i) Declaratory rulings. A declaratory ruling with respect to an analysis of a specific or hypothetical site, project, fact pattern or document or an interpretation of the applicability of a specific provision of § 489 of the Real Property Tax Law or § 11-243 of the Administrative Code or these rules to an actual or hypothetical site, project, fact pattern or document or any other issue related to eligibility may be given in the discretion of the Office upon payment of a non-refundable fee in the amount of seven hundred fifty dollars ($750) payable at the time such declaratory ruling is requested in writing. In no event shall a declaratory ruling bind the Office as to the overall eligibility of a project for J-51 benefits. At the discretion of the Commissioner, this fee may be waived for projects supervised or funded by HPD or any other New York City or New York State agency or instrumentality.

(j) [Reserved.]

(k) As provided in 28 RCNY 39-03, the revocation of benefits for noncompliance with the Act or this chapter shall not exempt any unit from continued compliance with the requirements of the Act or this chapter.

   (1) new multiple dwellings located outside the geographic exclusion area containing not less than three (3) dwelling units provided construction is commenced before December 31, 2007;

   (2) new multiple dwellings located in the geographic exclusion area if the commencement of construction occurred on or before November 29, 1985 and if such building is completed no later than December 31, 2000 and only to the extent the building receives a permanent Certificate of Occupancy indicating that it was built pursuant to architectural, structural, and mechanical plans approved by the Department of Buildings on or before November 29, 1985; and

   (2) Any multiple dwelling which results from the conversion or rehabilitation of any building or structure;

   (3) Any building or portion thereof which after the completion of construction is used as a hotel, as that term is defined herein;

   (4) Any building or portion thereof which after the completion of construction is used for single room occupancy, as that term is defined herein;

   (5) Any multiple dwelling situated on land which is mapped as a public park provided, however, that this exclusion from eligibility for exemption shall not apply to any land which has been mapped as a public park but which, for a period of ten years or more after the date of such mapping, has not been acquired by the state or the city in which such land is located and with respect to which land the Department of Parks and Recreation has determined that such land is not required for public park purposes, and that such department has no intention of acquiring such land and that no funds have been allocated for such purpose;

   (6) Any multiple dwelling situated on land which was utilized for ten or more consecutive years immediately prior to October first, nineteen hundred seventy-one as a "private park" as hereinafter defined.

   (9) For purposes of paragraphs (7) and (8) above, the obtaining of a variance or special permit to allow residential construction in a manufacturing or mixed-used district shall not render the newly constructed Class A multiple dwelling eligible for tax benefits under the Act. In addition, to the extent the zoning lot of a project includes any building or structure located in such non-eligible district that is not to be demolished, the partial tax exemption shall be reduced by an amount equal to the area of the portion of the zoning lot which is located in such ineligible area.

(e) Construction requirements. To be eligible for partial tax exemption, a multiple dwelling must meet the following requirements:

   (1) It shall contain at all times not less than the number of dwelling units specified in 28 RCNY § 6-02(b)(1). A multiple dwelling containing the requisite number of dwelling units may include: garden type maisonette dwelling projects containing a series of attached dwelling units which are provided as a group collectively with all essential services such as, but not limited to, water supply and house sewers, and which units are located on a site or plot under common ownership, including ownership as a condominium; and buildings erected at the same time with common exterior walls, provided that in each case such buildings are operated as a unit under a single ownership, notwithstanding that Certificates of Occupancy were issued by the Department of Buildings for separate portions thereof covering less than the requisite number of units.

   (2) If a multiple dwelling contains more than one hundred dwelling units, not less than ten percent of the dwelling units in such multiple dwelling shall contain at least four and one-half rooms and, in addition, not less than fifteen percent shall contain at least three and one-half rooms. The number of rooms in a dwelling unit shall be computed in accordance with the definition of "room count" contained in subdivision (c) of 28 RCNY § 6-01. Those units consisting of four and one-half rooms or more, to the extent that they comprise ten percent of all units in the multiple dwelling, shall not be included as part of the units which must contain three and one-half rooms, comprising a total of fifteen percent of all the units in the multiple dwelling. This room count requirement may be waived in writing at the discretion of the Department:

      (i) where the multiple dwelling is to provide housing for the elderly; or

      (ii) upon the filing of adequate documentation from which the Department determines that compliance with the room count requirement would impose an undue and unreasonable economic hardship. The necessity of alteration of existing construction shall not in itself be deemed such a hardship.

   (3) If construction of a new multiple dwelling commences on or after August 1, 1981 and such construction takes place on land which, immediately prior to the commencement of construction, was improved with a residential building or buildings that have since been substantially demolished, and the new building or buildings contain more than twenty dwelling units, then such new building or buildings shall contain at least five dwelling units for each Class A dwelling unit in existence immediately prior to the demolition preceding construction. The calculation of the ratio of new to old units shall be made based on the entire site included in the 421-a application. For purposes of this paragraph, "immediately prior to the commencement of construction" shall be deemed to be a date which is one month prior to the commencement of construction.

(f) Site requirements.

   (1) To be eligible for partial tax exemption, the land upon which an eligible project is located must have been vacant, predominantly vacant, under-utilized, or improved with a non-conforming use on the operative date. The operative date shall be:

      (i) thirty-six months prior to the commencement of construction, if construction commences on or after August 1, 1981; or

      (ii) October 1, 1971, if construction commenced before August, 1981.

   (2) If only part of the land upon which an otherwise eligible project is located satisfies the requirement set forth in paragraph (1), above, or if only part of a building or structure on said land would satisfy that requirement, partial tax exemption shall be available in accordance with the following formula:

      (i) If fifty-one percent (51%) or more of the area of the land satisfies the requirement set forth above, then the partial tax exemption shall be reduced by an amount equal to the percent of the area of the site which does not satisfy that requirement;

      (ii) If less than fifty-one percent (51%) of the area of the land satisfies the requirement set forth above, then the entire site is ineligible for partial tax exemption hereunder.

   (3) Definitions. For the purpose of this subdivision (f), the following definitions are applicable:

      Actual Assessed Valuation. "Actual assessed valuation" shall mean the assessed valuation of a tax lot without reference to § 1805(3) of the Real Property Tax Law.

      Land improved with a non-conforming use. "Land improved with a nonconforming use" is defined in the same manner as that term was defined in the Zoning Resolution in effect on the operative date.

      Predominantly vacant. "Predominantly vacant" land is a plot of land on which not more than fifteen percent (15%) of the lot area contained enclosed, permanent, improvements. Fences, sheds, garage attendant's booths, pier bulkheads, lighting fixtures and similar items, or any improvement having an Actual Assessed Value of less than $2,000 shall not constitute an enclosed, permanent improvement.

      Under-utilized. "Under-utilized" land is land or space which was under-utilized by virtue of the fact that:

         (A) It was improved with a residential building or buildings

            (a) whose room count in occupied dwelling units numbered not more than seventy percent of the room count in dwelling units in the new building or buildings; or

            (b) whose aggregate floor area was no greater than seventy percent of the aggregate floor area of the new building or buildings.

            (c) provided, however, that buildings commenced prior to the effective date of these rules shall be governed by the rules in effect at the time of commencement.

         (B) It consisted of air rights above a public roadway, waterway, railroad right of way, public buildings, or other similar property used by the general public, provided that the public building was used by the general public on the operative date and continues to be so used and classified after the completion of the eligible construction, and provided further that "public building" shall mean structures or parts of structures in which persons congregate for civic, political, educational, religious or recreational purposes, or in which persons are harbored to receive medical, charitable or other care or treatment, or in which persons are held or detained by reason of public or civic duty, or for correctional purposes, including among others, court houses, schools, colleges, libraries, museums, exhibition buildings, lecture halls, churches, assembly halls, lodge rooms, club houses with more than five sleeping rooms, dance halls, theatres, bath houses, hospitals, asylums, armories, fire houses, police stations, jails and passenger depots; or

(g) Rent regulatory requirements. To be eligible for partial tax exemption the land upon which the eligible project is located must meet the following letting, rental and occupancy requirements:

   (1) If a building which, on December 31, 1974, contained more than twenty-five occupied dwelling units administered under the City Rent and Rehabilitation Law, the Rent Stabilization Law of nineteen hundred sixty-nine, or the Emergency Tenant Protection Act of nineteen hundred seventy-four, is displaced, or any unit therein is displaced, the new multiple dwelling will be eligible for partial tax exemption only if a Certificate of Eviction was issued for at least one dwelling unit in the displaced building. If only one unit is displaced as the result of eligible construction, the Certificate of Eviction must pertain to that displaced unit. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the sale, transfer or utilization of air rights over residential buildings which were not demolished shall not be construed as a displacement within the purview of this subdivision (g).

   (2) Notwithstanding the provisions of any local law for the stabilization of rents in multiple dwellings or the Emergency Tenant Protection Act of 1974, the rents of a unit shall be fully subject to regulation under such local law or such Act, unless exempt under such local law or such act from regulation by reason of the cooperative or condominium status of the unit, for the entire period during which the property is receiving tax benefits pursuant to the Act, or for the period any such applicable local law or such Act is in effect, whichever is shorter. Thereafter, such rents shall continue to be subject to such regulation to the same extent and in the same manner as if this subdivision (g) had never applied thereto, except that for dwelling units in buildings completed, as that term is defined herein, on or after January 1, 1974, such rents shall be deregulated if:

      (i) with respect to dwelling units located in multiple dwellings completed after January 1, 1974 such unit becomes vacant after the expiration of the lease for the unit in effect when such benefit period or applicable law or Act expires, provided, however, such unit shall not be deregulated if the Commissioner of the New York State Division of Housing and Community Renewal or a court of competent jurisdiction finds the unit became vacant because the owner thereof or any person acting on his or her behalf engaged in any course of conduct, including but not limited to, interruption or discontinuance of essential services which interfered with or disturbed or was intended to interfere with or disturb the comfort, repose, peace or quiet of the tenant in his use or occupancy of such unit, and that upon such finding in addition to being subject to any other penalties or remedies permitted by law, the owner of such unit shall be barred from collecting rent for such unit in excess of that charged to the tenant, if the tenant so desires, in which case the rent of such tenant shall be established as if such tenant had not vacated such unit, or compliance with such other remedy, including, but not limited to, all remedies provided for by the emergency tenant protection act of nineteen seventy-four for rent overcharge or failure to comply with any order of the Commissioner of the New York State Division of Housing and Community Renewal, as shall be determined by said Commissioner to be appropriate; provided, however, that if a tenant fails to accept any such offer of restoration of possession, such unit shall return to rent stabilization at the previously regulated rent.

      (ii) with respect to dwelling units located in multiple dwellings with became subject to the rent stabilization provisions of the Act on or after July 1, 1984, the lease for the unit expires after such tax benefit period expires, provided that each lease and renewal thereof for such unit for the tenant entitled to a lease at the time of such deregulation contained a notice in at least twelve (12) point type informing such tenant that the unit shall be subject to deregulation upon the expiration of such benefit period and stated the approximate date on which such benefit period was expected to expire. If each lease and renewal thereof has not contained such notice, a unit covered by such lease shall be subject to subdivision (i) above even though it became subject to the rent stabilization provisions of the Act on or after July 1, 1984. This subdivision (ii) shall not apply to any unit in any multiple dwelling which was subject to the rent stabilization provisions of the Act prior to July 1, 1984, notwithstanding any contrary provision in any lease or renewal thereof.

   (3) Notwithstanding paragraph (2) above, dwelling units in multiple dwellings owned as cooperatives or condominiums which are exempt from such provisions of law shall not be required to be subject to the provisions of law set forth in that paragraph (2) during the time period specified therein. Newly created dwelling units in a building for which a prospectus for condominium or cooperative formation has been submitted to the Attorney General at the time of application for benefits to the Office, shall not be required to be registered with the New York State Division of Housing and Community Renewal, provided that an affidavit has been filed with the Office stating that the sponsor will register the building and all units as they become occupied, with the New York State Division of Housing and Community Renewal within fifteen months from the date of issuance of a Final Certificate of Eligibility if a cooperative or condominium plan has not been declared effective by that time.

   (4) The offering by the owner to all tenants in rental dwelling units in the multiple dwelling, of an initial lease of at least two years; unless the dwelling unit's rent is regulated by local laws, such as § 26-401 of the Administrative Code, which do not provide for the offering of leases for fixed terms. This requirement shall not preclude a shorter lease where requested by the tenant, or where a lease of at least two years is specifically prohibited by the terms of a Department of Housing and Urban Development regulatory agreement for an insured subsidized project, or where, through foreclosure, title to a building eligible for partial tax exemption pursuant to the Act is held subsequently by the Department of Housing and Urban Development.

   (5) No lease for dwelling units subject to the Rent Stabilization Law or Emergency Tenant Protection Act which are registered with the New York State Division of Housing and Community Renewal shall contain escalation clauses for real estate taxes or any other provisions for increasing the rent set forth in the lease other than permitting an increase in rent pursuant to an order of the New York State Division of Housing and Community Renewal or the Rent Guidelines Board; or an increase of 2.2 percent pursuant to 28 RCNY § 6-04(b).






*§ 6-03 Local Community Planning Board Review.* ::


(a) Submission of application to local community board. An applicant for partial tax exemption pursuant to the Act whose project contains more than twenty dwelling units shall send a complete copy of the application for a Preliminary Certificate of Eligibility and supporting papers by certified mail or hand delivery to the local Community Planning Board for the area in which such project is located within ten days of submission of the application to the Department. A copy of the receipt shall be hand delivered or mailed to the Department for annexation to the application no later than ten days after the date appearing on such receipt.

(b) Standards for review. The local Community Board shall have a forty-five day period after receipt of such application and supporting papers to file objections with the Department as to the applicant's eligibility for partial tax exemption hereunder. Such objections, if any, may only be based upon an applicant's eligibility under subdivision two of § 421-a of the Real Property Tax Law or the applicant's failure to comply with the eligibility requirements in 28 RCNY § 6-02. The local Community Board may, in its own discretion and within the forty-five day period, hold a public hearing to determine whether any objections as to eligibility should be filed. Nothing contained in this section shall preclude a final determination of ineligibility of an applicant by the Department prior to the expiration of the forty-five day period.

(c) Notification to community board. In the event the local Community Board files objections, the Department shall make a determination thereon and notify such Community Board within forty-five days after receipt of the objections.

(d) Review of projects containing more than one hundred fifty dwelling units. Where a project contains more than one hundred fifty dwelling units, the local Community Board may, within thirty days of the receipt of a copy of an applicant's notification, request the Department to hold a public hearing solely on the question of the applicant's eligibility under subdivision two of § 421-a of the Real Property Tax Law or the applicant's failure to comply with the eligibility requirements in 28 RCNY § 6-02. If such request is made, the Department shall hold a hearing before the Commissioner or other person or persons whom he or she may designate, make a determination, and notify the Community Board within forty-five days after such hearing.






*§ 6-04 Determination of Initial Rent; Rent Increases.* ::


(a) Determining the initial adjusted monthly rent and the comparative adjusted monthly rent for rental dwelling units. No certification of eligibility shall be issued by the Department until the Department determines the initial adjusted monthly rent to be paid by tenants residing in rental dwelling units contained within the multiple dwelling. Except for affordable units, the initial adjusted monthly rent is determined in accordance with the provisions of paragraph (3) below.

   (1) The total expenses of the multiple dwelling shall be determined by the Department in order to calculate the initial adjusted monthly rent. Total expenses shall mean the annual total of the following:

      (i) An amount for the annual cost of operation and maintenance, as established pursuant to the Annual Schedule of Reasonable Costs; plus,

      (ii) An amount for vacancies, contingency reserves and management fees as established pursuant to the Annual Schedule of Reasonable Costs; plus,

      (iii) Projected real property taxes to be levied on the multiple dwelling and the land on which it is situated at the time of estimated initial occupancy; plus,

      (iv) Fourteen percent of the total project cost, as determined pursuant to 28 RCNY § 6-05(b)(1)(i) and the Annual Schedule of Reasonable Costs, which amount will include debt service; less,

      (v) The estimated annual income to be derived from any Floor Area of Commercial, Community Facilities, and Accessory Use Space in the multiple dwelling.

   (2) The adjusted monthly rent per room shall be determined by the Department by dividing the total expenses as determined pursuant to paragraph (1) above by twelve (12) and then dividing that amount by the Room Count as defined in subdivision (c) of 28 RCNY § 6-01 of this chapter; i.e.,

   (3) The The initial adjusted monthly rent for each dwelling unit shall be determined by the Department by multiplying the adjusted monthly rent per room to be determined pursuant to paragraph (2) above by the Room Count, as defined in subdivision (c) of 28 RCNY § 6-01, of each rental dwelling unit. Adjustments to the initial adjusted monthly rent per room to be determined pursuant to paragraph (2) above by the Room Count, as defined in subdivision (c) of 28 RCNY § 6-01, of each rental dwelling unit. Adjustments to the initial adjusted monthly rent for any dwelling unit may be allowed by the Department provided that the total of the rentals charged in the multiple dwelling do not exceed the total expenses of such multiple dwelling, as determined pursuant to paragraph (1) above; i.e.,

(b) Rent increases. The owner of a multiple dwelling receiving partial tax exemption may insert in each lease to be effective during the period of gradual diminution of tax exemption, as defined in 28 RCNY § 6-06(e), a provision for an annual rent increase over the initial adjusted monthly rental at a rate not to exceed 2.2 percent per annum on the anniversary date of the first lease for the unit provided, however, that no increase shall be permitted pursuant to this subdivision (b) unless specifically provided for in each affected lease, and provided further that no more than one such increase per unit may be charged or collected in each given year regardless of the number of lease renewals or new leases which may pertain to that unit. The initial 2.2 percent escalation and all subsequent escalations shall be based solely on the actual rental amount in effect (regardless of whether the legal regulated rent may be greater) at the commencement of the period during which the increase may be charged and shall not be compounded from year to year but rather shall remain constant based on said rent. In addition, the increase shall be independent of any other escalation authorized by the Rent Guidelines Board and shall not be considered or included when a Rent Guidelines Board increase is effected, making the latter increase effective upon the base rent, excluding the 2.2 percent escalation. The maximum increase permitted by this subdivision (b) is 19.8 percent over the actual rental amount in effect at the commencement of the period during which the increase may be charged. The maximum increase permitted by this subdivision (b) may be charged in each year following the expiration of the tax benefit period, but shall not exceed 19.8 percent, or that amount charged in the last year of the exemption period, and shall not become part of the base rent.

(c) Annual rent schedule. Each year the owner shall make available to the Office a schedule of rents for each unit in the building.

   (1) Upon receipt of the application for a Preliminary Certificate of Eligibility the Department shall determine the initial adjusted monthly rent and the comparative adjusted monthly rent with respect to rental dwelling units contained within the multiple dwelling pursuant to 28 RCNY § 6-04(a). Upon the Commissioner's determination that a multiple dwelling is entitled to partial tax exemption hereunder the Department shall issue a Preliminary Certificate of Eligibility to be delivered by the applicant to the appropriate borough officer of the Property Division of the Department of Finance together with his, her or its application to the Department of Finance for partial tax exemption. Such certification shall be conditioned upon the filing and approval of an application for a Final Certificate of Eligibility as herein provided.

   (2) Upon receipt of the application for a Final Certificate of Eligibility and either a Temporary Certificate of Occupancy for all residential areas in the multiple dwelling or a Permanent Certificate of Occupancy, and upon the Commissioner's determination that a multiple dwelling is entitled to partial tax exemption hereunder, the Department shall issue a Final Certificate of Eligibility to be delivered by the owner to the appropriate borough officer of the Property Division of the Department of Finance between February 1st and March 15th, together with his, her or its application to the Department of Finance for partial tax exemption.

A declaratory ruling with respect to an analysis of a specific or hypothetical site, project, fact pattern or document or an interpretation of the applicability of a specific provision of the 421-a statute or Rules to an actual or hypothetical site, project, fact pattern or document or any other issue related to eligibility may be given in the discretion of the Office upon payment of a non-refundable fee in the amount of $1,500 payable at the time such declaratory ruling is requested in writing. In no event shall a declaratory ruling bind the Office as to the overall eligibility of a project for 421-a benefits.








*§ 6-06 The Tax Exemption.* ::


(a) Taxes on prior assessed valuation not subject to exemption. Taxes on the assessed value of land receiving benefits under this section, and any improvements thereon, during the tax year preceding the commencement of construction are not eligible for exemption under the Act. Tax exemption under the Act is not available until the tax year following the first year taxable status date following commencement of construction. The Prior Assessed Valuation remains subject to taxation at the prevailing rate from year to year.

(b) Diminution of tax exemption for excess commercial space. As of July 1, 1975, in the event the multiple dwelling contains Floor Area of Commercial, Community Facility and/or Accessory Use Space which exceeds twelve percent (12%) of the Aggregate Floor Area, there shall be a diminution of the tax exemption in an amount equal to the ratio of Floor Area of Commercial, Community Facility and/or Accessory Use Space in excess of twelve percent (12%) of the Aggregate Floor Area to the Aggregate Area. Where a project contains a separately assessed parcel such as a residential condominium located above a separately owned commercial space, the proportionate reduction of tax exemption resulting from Commercial, Community Facility and Accessory Use Space in excess of twelve percent (12%) shall be allocated entirely to the non-residential parcel or parcels up to the point that no exemption exists for any such parcel before applying the reduction in exemption to the residential space, provided, however, that such allocation shall only be made with respect to properties for which a preliminary application for benefits is received after July 26, 1993 or for which a final application is received after such date if no preliminary application was received.

(c) Exemption during construction. Multiple Dwellings which satisfy all of the requirements set forth herein and have received a Preliminary Certificate of Eligibility shall be exempt from real property taxes, other than assessments for local improvements, upon any increase in assessed valuation over the Prior Assessed Valuation during the statutorily defined period of construction, or for a period of three years, whichever is less, provided that taxes shall be paid in each tax year in which full or partial exemption is in effect on the Prior Assessed Valuation, as defined in 28 RCNY § 6-01(c).

(d) Exemption after construction. After the first taxable status date immediately following the completion of construction any increase in assessed valuation over the Prior Assessed Valuation of eligible multiple dwellings which have received a Final Certificate of Eligibility shall be exempt from real property taxes, other than assessments for local improvements, for either ten, fifteen, twenty or twenty-five consecutive tax years, as provided in 28 RCNY § 6-02(d), pursuant to the following schedules. In addition, owners must pay full taxes on the Prior Assessed Valuation, as defined in 28 RCNY § 6-01)(c).

In addition, where a written agreement was executed on or after January 1, 1991, dwelling units created to satisfy the requirements of this chapter may also be located on a site or sites within the geographic exclusion area. Sites outside of the geographic exclusion area may be either privately owned or owned by the City of New York. The development of City owned sites must be carried out pursuant to the provisions of 28 RCNY § 6-08(d).

(d) Development of City-owned sites.

   (1) An applicant for benefits pursuant to this Act who wishes to create the required number of low and moderate income units on a vacant City-owned site may be offered a site or sites pursuant to a method to be established by the Department. Such method shall make available parcels which will yield the necessary number of low and moderate income units.

   (2) The following procedures apply to the substantial rehabilitation or conversion of City-owned sites or to new construction on vacant City-owned parcels:

      (i) All construction shall be performed by the developer under a license agreement with the City. At no time will title to the multiple dwelling be conveyed to the developer. All hard and soft development costs will be borne by the developer.

      (ii) After a permanent Certificate of Occupancy has been issued for the multiple dwelling or dwellings, the Department shall convey title to the multiple dwelling or dwellings to a qualified not-for-profit organization in whose catchment area the project is located. Disposition will be for $1 per multiple dwelling through ULURP or UDAAP.

   (1) All affordable units created pursuant to this section must be owned as rentals, for either 20 years or as long as the building containing the affordable units receives real estate tax benefits, whichever is longer.

   (2) Buildings containing affordable units created on privately owned sites may be owned by either a for-profit or a qualified not-for-profit organization.

      (i) In the event ownership of the affordable units is retained by a for-profit owner, the owner of the building receiving the benefits of the Act as a result of satisfaction of the requirements of this section shall have the ongoing responsibility for insuring the continuing maintenance and operation of the affordable units in a habitable condition. Should an owner fail to maintain such units as affordable or in a habitable condition, benefits of the Act received by the multiple dwelling located in the geographic exclusion area shall be revoked retroactive to the start of construction. Such revocation shall be conducted in accordance with the procedures established pursuant to chapter thirty-nine of this title.

      (ii) The developer of the affordable units on privately owned sites may elect to transfer ownership of the off-site units to a qualified not-for-profit organization is a New York State corporation experienced in the management of low income housing and approved in writing by the Department in accordance with the purpose of this section. In that event, the developer must convey title to a qualified not-for-profit for $1.00 per multiple dwelling. The not-for-profit owner shall assume the ongoing responsibility for insuring the continuing maintenance and operation of the affordable units in a habitable condition. Failure of the not-for-profit to maintain such units as affordable or in a habitable condition shall not result in a revocation of the tax benefits received by the multiple dwellings located in the geographic exclusion area.

      (iii) A developer creating affordable units on a privately-owned site with the assistance of the Federal Low Income Housing Credit under § 42 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 may retain ownership of such units if the developer enters into a management contract with a qualified managing agent approved in writing by the Department and conforms to the requirements of this section. Failure of the managing agent to maintain such units as affordable or in a habitable condition shall not result in a revocation of the tax benefits received by the multiple dwelling located in the geographic exclusion area.

         (A) The management contract must be approved by the Department and shall be for twenty years or for the length of the real estate tax benefits on the affordable units, whichever is longer. The developer must obtain the prior written approval of the Department to substitute another qualified managing agent if, during the term of the contract, the relationship with the original manager is severed for any reason.

         (B) The affordable units must remain as rent stabilized units for twenty years or the length of the real estate tax benefits on such affordable units, whichever is longer. Thereafter, upon each vacancy the affordable units may be deregulated according to the following schedule:

         (C) The developer shall enter into an agreement with the Department to fund two reserve funds. The first shall create sufficient funds for maintenance and operation of the affordable housing units to the extent to which maintenance and operating expenses exceed income available from the rent roll, and shall be created in accordance with 28 RCNY § 6-08(f). The second covers capital improvement costs and will require the developer to deposit with the City a Capital Improvement Escrow Fund equal to 1 percent (1%) of total development costs. The developer will be required to replenish the fund within sixty (60) days of any drawing down. Interest will accrue to such Fund, which will be held by the Department. The not-for-profit can draw on this escrow fund upon authorization by the Department if the developer fails to make necessary capital repairs. Neither the Department nor the City shall have any liability as Escrow Agent; the Department's determination of withdrawal of funds shall be binding on all parties.

         (D) If HPD approves a not-for-profit manager, the developer must enter into a purchase option contract with the not-for-profit for the period of the affordable housing plan. This option contract shall state that the not-for-profit manager may purchase the affordable units for $1 if the owner abandons the project. Evidence of abandonment shall include failure by the developer to meet the maintenance and operating expenses, failure to replenish the Capital Improvement Escrow Fund, or failure to make necessary repairs. Further, if during the time of the Federal Low Income Housing Credit, such credit is revoked and recaptured due to failure by the developer to comply with the applicable provisions of the Internal Revenue Code and any applicable regulations, then the not-for-profit may exercise the purchase option listed above. If the developer retains ownership through the end of the affordable housing plan, then the Capital Improvement Escrow Fund is paid to the developer upon expiration of the affordable housing plan. If the developer abandons the development before the end of the expiration of the affordable housing plan, then the Capital Improvement Escrow Fund is transferred to the not-for-profit. The purchase option contract may provide for an automatic termination of the contract if HPD approves termination of the not-for-profit as managing agent. In the absence of a not-for-profit manager, HPD may require the owner to enter into a purchase option contract with a not-for-profit acceptable to HPD which would take effect in the event of abandonment.

(f) Special reserve account. The developer of affordable units necessary to qualify a multiple dwelling within the geographic exclusion area for benefits of the Act, which shall not be owned by the for-profit developer of such multiple dwelling, must create a special operating reserve fund. The fund shall be in the amount of $2.25 for each square foot of affordable housing contained in such new, newly converted or substantially rehabilitated multiple dwelling or dwellings, including a pro rata share of common space of buildings not entirely lower income. The fund shall be placed in a blocked account which will be administered by the Department. This reserve fund is separate from the normal building reserve fund built into the rent roll that will be accumulated over time and will be available only on a program-wide basis to cover unanticipated increases in the costs of operating and maintaining units in general. Once an expenditure from the fund has been authorized on a programmatic basis, the dollars can be drawn down on a project-by-project basis. There will be a separate account for each project. Notwithstanding the above, the reserve fund may also be drawn down, with the approval of the Department, in the event of unusual occurrences not normally covered by the normal building reserves.

(g) Construction requirements.

   (1) Affordable Class A dwelling units created through new construction must meet the standards set forth in the Department's "Design Guidelines For Housing – New Construction" and "Standard Specifications" ("Design Guidelines") (applicant should obtain the most recent edition of the Design Guidelines from the Department). In addition, such dwelling units must satisfy one of the following requirements:

      (i) Unless the affordable units are created under 28 RCNY § 6-08(b)(3) or (b)(5), 50 percent (50%) of the units must contain two or more bedrooms, and in all cases average square footage and bedroom mix must be equally distributed with respect to all income levels; or

      (ii) For multiple dwellings that commence construction before December 28, 2007, such affordable units must be located in the same building and must contain the same average square footage and bedroom mix of all residential units contained in such multiple dwelling. For multiple dwellings that commence construction on or after December 28, 2007, if the affordable units are created in accordance with 28 RCNY § 6-08(b)(1) and unless preempted by federal requirements, (A) all affordable units must have a comparable number of bedrooms and a unit mix proportional to the market rate units contained in such multiple dwelling, or (B) at least fifty percent (50%) of the affordable units must have two or more bedrooms and not more than fifty percent (50%) of the remaining affordable units can be smaller than one bedroom, or (C) the floor area of the affordable units must be no less than twenty percent of the total floor area of all dwelling units in such multiple dwelling.

   (2) Affordable Class A dwelling units created through substantial rehabilitation or conversion must meet the standards set forth in the Department's "Design Guidelines For Housing – Substantial Rehabilitation" and "Standard Specifications." ("Design Guidelines") (applicant should obtain the most recent edition of the Design Guidelines from the Department).

      (i) In order for the rehabilitation of a vacant multiple dwelling or the conversion of a non-residential building to qualify under 28 RCNY § 6-08(b)(4), the scope of work must include but is not limited to the following:

         (A) Beam replacement, to the extent required by the Department

         (B) New subflooring

         (C) New partition framing

         (D) New sheetrock walls and ceilings

         (E) New windows

         (F) New finish flooring, roofing and insulation

         (G) New kitchen cabinets

         (H) New baths with ceramic tile finishes

         (I) New interior and exterior doors (wood and metal)

         (J) New finish carpentry

         (K) New plumbing

         (L) New heating

         (M) New electrical

         (N) New elevators (where applicable)

         (O) Masonry repairs, to the extent required by the Department

         (P) New fire escapes, to the extent required by the Department

         (Q) Concrete site work, to the extent required by the Department

      (ii) At least fifty percent (50%) of the affordable units created pursuant to this paragraph shall contain two or more bedrooms each, except that the Department may reduce the bedrooms requirements when, in the sole opinion of the Department, existing structural elements preclude compliance. If the Department approves a reduction in the number of bedrooms, the developer will be required to rehabilitate or create through conversion additional units in a room and bedroom configuration which is acceptable to the Department, to compensate for the number of bedrooms and square footage which would have been obtained had the bedroom requirement been met. For the purposes of computation, the Department will require three studios or two one-bedroom units to be built for every two-bedroom unit lost. The Department will seek the solution which results in creating apartments with the highest bedroom count possible, consistent with the Department's policy of creating housing which meets the needs of families.

   (3) Single Room Occupancy Units created to conform to 28 RCNY § 6-08(b)(5) must conform to the Department's Single Room Occupancy Guidelines (applicant should obtain the most recent edition of the Guidelines from the Department).

(i) Initial rents; re-rentals. 

   (1) For projects permitted to assume debt pursuant to 28 RCNY § 6-08(o)(2), the Department shall establish initial rents for individual units as provided in subparagraph (i). For all other projects, initial rents shall be established as provided in subparagraph (ii).

      (i) Units rented to persons of low income are not to exceed 30% of 55% of median income. Units rented to persons of moderate income are not to exceed the average of 30% of 75% of median income, provided that no initial annual rent will be established for any unit in a moderate or mixed income project which exceeds 30% of 95% of annual median income. The Department shall establish a total rent roll for units created pursuant to this section based upon program-wide standards for the amount necessary for maintenance, operation, administration, creation of normal reserve accounts, debt service, and in consideration of the income level to be served. For the purpose of determining median income, the following family sizes shall be imputed:

      (ii) The Department shall establish a total rent roll for units created pursuant to this section based upon program-wide standards for the amount necessary for maintenance, operation, administration and the creation of normal reserve accounts, and in consideration of the income level to be served. For affordable units being constructed under any of the options in this section, the managing agent may set rents higher than the allowable rent roll only with the prior written approval of the Department and only as long as no household is charged more than thirty percent (30%) of their annual income for rent. Such rents shall be the higher of the rents in effect when the Written Agreement for Creation of Affordable Housing is entered into or when construction of the affordable housing units commences. The initial rents for individual units will be determined by the managing entity, and must be affordable to low and moderate income families, as defined in this chapter. In no case shall the initial rent of any affordable unit exceed 30% of 100% of median income.

   (2) Upon initial occupancy, all units created pursuant to this section must be registered with the New York State Division of Housing and Community Renewal. Such units must remain rent stabilized for the entire period during which such units receive real estate tax benefits under any New York State or New York City tax abatement and/or exemption programs, or for 20 years, whichever is longer.

   (3) Future rent increases may not exceed the increases established by the Rent Guidelines Board.

   (4) Upon vacancy, units must be re-rented at no more than the legal stabilized rent. All units must be rented to families earning no more than four times such annual rent.

   (5) Tenants holding a lease and in occupancy of any unit created pursuant to this section at the expiration of the rent stabilization period pursuant to paragraph (2) of this subdivision (i) shall have the right to remain as rent stabilized tenants for the duration of their occupancy. Once units become vacant after termination of benefits, the owner of such units shall have the option to de-stabilize such rents.

   (6) Tenant incomes and rents must be certified to the Department by the owner of the multiple dwelling containing the affordable units following initial rent up. Thereafter, the owner of such multiple dwelling must certify to the Department tenant incomes and rents for all re-rentals after vacancies on an annual basis, but no later than January 31 for each calendar year ending December 31.

   (7) For the purposes of this subsection (i), "rent" shall mean gross rent, as defined for the purposes of the federal low income housing tax credit program, and shall include utilities. In the event that utilities are charged separately, gross rent shall be reduced accordingly.

(j) Second tier rents. As an additional protection against future insolvency of units created pursuant to this section and owned by a qualified not-for-profit organization, the Department will also register with the New York State Division of Housing and Community Renewal a second level of rents. This second tier of rents will be set by the Department at or very close to the maximum rents affordable to moderate income families as defined in this chapter. Implementing the second tier of rents for any unit will be allowed on vacancy only with the Department's written permission. The Department will give its permission after a finding that the project has been efficiently managed and the need for second tier rents are a result of factors outside the control of the not-for-profit owner, but in any event, in the following cases only:

   (1) When the project's financial feasibility is threatened by a significant unanticipated rise in maintenance and operating expenses that cannot be covered by the rent roll and available reserves; or

   (2) When a significant, unanticipated expense occurs in the building that cannot be covered by the rent roll and available reserves; or

   (3) When rents rise faster than the income of the tenants who are paying 30 percent (30%) of their income in rent and where the increased rent(s) on the vacant unit(s) are used to maintain the rents for existing tenants at 30 percent (30%) of their income.

(k) Time requirements; filing fees. 

   (1) The written agreement with the Department for the creation of affordable units pursuant to this section must be entered into prior to the commencement of construction of such affordable units.

   (2) Such written agreement may be entered into after the commencement of construction of the multiple dwelling or dwellings located in the geographic exclusion area seeking benefits of this Act.

   (3) Any request for a written agreement pursuant to 28 RCNY § 6-08(l) shall be accompanied by a filing fee of $100 for each proposed unit of affordable housing, which fee shall be non-refundable but shall be applied to the filing fee for the tax benefits for the affordable units, as established by 28 RCNY § 6-05(c) and 28 RCNY § 5-05(f) governing tax exemption and abatement pursuant to § 11-243 of the Administrative Code (J-51).

(l) Request for written agreement. The following shall be required to be submitted to the Department with any request for a written agreement. Once approved, all documents will be incorporated into the agreement, the complete package to be referred to as The 421-a Written Agreement for Creation of Affordable Housing:

   (7) A marketing plan for tenant selection and apartment rental. The marketing plan shall identify specific organizations or institutions, such as Community Boards, not-for-profit organizations, senior citizen centers, religious institutions, etc., which shall advertise the availability of the affordable units and must be in accordance with the Department's marketing guidelines, which can be obtained from the Department. All marketing efforts must meet equal opportunity and fair housing guidelines.

   (8) A statement that a rental multiple dwelling located within the geographic exclusion area which qualified for benefits under the Act pursuant to 28 RCNY § 6-08(b)(3), (4) or (6) of this section will not be converted to cooperative or condominium ownership during the period of partial tax exemption. Conversion may be permitted by the Department subsequent to the expiration of the period of partial tax exemption where the affordable units are owned by a for-profit organization only if the conversion sponsor:

(m) Certification; negotiable certificates.

   (1) After the Department determines that a request for Written Agreement is complete and satisfies all requirements of this section, the Department shall approve the request for a Written Agreement. The Written Agreement will provide for the granting of benefits of this Act for a specified number of dwelling units contained in a multiple dwelling located within the exclusion area. Such Written Agreement must be submitted to the Department with the application for benefits of the Act for the multiple dwelling located in the geographic exclusion area. In the event benefits of the Act are granted based upon a Written Agreement, failure to satisfy the conditions contained in such Written Agreement will result in a revocation of any benefits received by the multiple dwelling located in the exclusion area.

   (2) Upon the submission to the Department of a permanent Certificate of Occupancy for, or the temporary Certificate of Occupancy for the entire residential portion of, the building containing the affordable units created pursuant to this section, the Department shall conduct a site inspection. Following that site inspection and upon satisfaction that all terms of the Written Agreement and of this section have been met, the Department shall issue the Negotiable Certificates representing the completion of the affordable units.

   (3) Such Negotiable Certificate shall be required prior to the issuance of the Final Certificate of Eligibility for a multiple dwelling located within the geographic exclusion area pursuant to 28 RCNY § 6-05(e), unless at the sole option of the Department, pursuant to 28 RCNY § 6-05(d)(l)(vi), a Letter of Credit has been submitted to the Department.

   (4) Such Negotiable Certificate shall provide that a specified number of dwelling units containing up to an average size of twelve hundred square feet to be constructed in the geographic exclusion area shall be eligible to receive benefits of the Act.

   (5) In the event that the benefits of the Act are to be transferred to more than one building located within the geographic exclusion area, and at the written request of the applicant, the Negotiable Certificate shall be "drawn down" by the amount required for each transfer, and a new Negotiable Certificate, endorsed by the applicant, shall be issued for each transfer. Application for the benefits of the Act must be accompanied by the original Negotiable Certificate and a copy of the Certificate of Completion.

(n) Governmental assistance to affordable units.

   (1) Affordable units created pursuant to 28 RCNY § 6-08(b) may not be the recipient of any other as-of-right or discretionary government benefit, consideration or assistance, excluding tax exempt financing, federal low income housing tax credits, and real estate tax benefits enumerated in paragraph (3) of this subdivision (n).

   (2) Affordable units created to satisfy the low and moderate income housing requirements of any other governmental benefit, consideration or assistance except tax exempt financing, federal low income housing tax credits, and real estate tax benefits enumerated in paragraph (3) of this subdivision (n) shall not be considered as being created to satisfy the requirements of this section. Units created pursuant to 28 RCNY § 6-08(b)(i) shall not also qualify as affordable units under this section.

   (3) In order to qualify a multiple dwelling located within the geographic exclusion area for benefits under the Act, affordable units created by rehabilitation or conversion must receive a Certificate of Eligibility for the benefits of § 11-243 or 11-244 of the Administrative Code or § 421-g of the Real Property Tax Law, and affordable units created by new construction must receive a Certificate of Eligibility for the benefits of the Act, unless such units obtain tax exemption pursuant to § 420-a or 420-b of the Real Property Tax Law, § 696 of the General Municipal Law, or § 577 of the Private Housing Finance Law.

   (4) Affordable units created pursuant to 28 RCNY § 6-08(b)(2) through (b)(5) of these rules may not be used, or have been used, to satisfy a requirement to create low or moderate income housing imposed by a federal, state, or local agency or instrumentality or pursuant to a court or administrative order or decree (unless such requirement is imposed solely as a condition to receiving bond financing or federal low income housing tax credits for the property containing the affordable units).

   (5) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this subdivision, affordable units created to satisfy the requirements of the inclusionary housing program established pursuant to the New York City Zoning Resolution may be used to qualify a multiple dwelling in the geographic exclusion area for the benefits of the Act provided that (i) at least twenty percent (20%) of the units contained in the multiple dwelling applying for such benefits are affordable to persons of low and moderate income as defined by this chapter, and (ii) such affordable units only generate floor area compensation for a compensated development on either (a) the same zoning lot as such affordable units, or (b) within a development site on which such affordable units are located where such development site involves several zoning lots that were reviewed and approved as a single unit pursuant to the New York City Zoning Resolution. For purposes of this paragraph (5), "floor area compensation" and "compensated development" shall have the meanings set forth in Section 23-911 of the New York City Zoning Resolution.

(o) Mortgage and debt limitations.

   (1) In the case of a project which qualifies for tax benefits pursuant to 28 RCNY § 6-08(b)(1), any lien or mortgage encumbering one or more low and moderate income units in such project shall expressly provide that it is subject and subordinate to the Written Agreement imposing the restrictions required by this 28 RCNY § 6-08, commencing upon issuance of a Final Certificate of Eligibility for such tax benefits.

   (2) Projects undertaken pursuant to either 28 RCNY § 6-08(b)(4)(i), (b)(4)(ii), or (b)(4)(iii) may be encumbered with a lien or mortgage, provided the amount of debt placed on the project permits rents for such units to comply with the provisions of 28 RCNY § 6-08(i) and such lien or mortgage expressly provides that it is subject and subordinate to the Written Agreement.

            (iv) the construction of any such multiple dwelling also must be completed without undue delay. For purposes of this definition of "commence,":

               (1) for any application for a Preliminary Certificate of Eligibility that is filed no later than June 24, 2012, or that is filed with respect to a project that was the subject of mortgage foreclosure proceedings or other lien enforcement litigation by a lender on or before June 24, 2012: (A) if a project consists of one multiple dwelling and such multiple dwelling is completed within seventy-two (72) months from the later to occur of (1) the date of the installation of a new metal or concrete structure or of the beginning of the actual construction of the conversion, alteration or improvement of the pre-existing building or structure, respectively, (2) the date upon which a building or alteration permit for the multiple dwelling (based upon architectural and structural plans approved by the Department of Buildings) was issued by such department, or (3) December 28, 2007, such multiple dwelling shall be deemed to have been completed without undue delay, and (B) if a project meets the requirements of clause (ii) of this paragraph (2), if all of the multiple dwellings in such multibuilding project are completed within seventy-two (72) months from the later to occur of (1) the date of the installation of a new metal or concrete structure for the first multiple dwelling in such multibuilding project or of the beginning of the actual construction of the conversion, alteration or improvement of the first pre-existing building or structure in such multibuilding project, respectively, (2) the date upon which a building or alteration permit for the first multiple dwelling (based upon architectural and structural plans approved by the Department of Buildings) was issued by such department, or (3) December 28, 2007, all of the multiple dwellings in such multibuilding project shall be deemed to have been completed without undue delay. Where construction is not completed within such seventy-two (72) month period and an architect or professional engineer has certified that such construction was completed without undue delay, the Department will not merely rely on such certification. In order to determine whether such construction was, in fact, completed without undue delay, the Department will consider the following factors: (i) the extraordinary size and/or complexity of the construction project; (ii) strikes or other unavoidable labor stoppages of substantial duration and severity; (iii) industry-wide shortages of construction materials of substantial duration and severity; (iv) substantial damage to completed construction work caused by fire or other casualty, and (v) mortgage foreclosure proceedings or other lien enforcement litigation by a lender with regard to such project. In each case, the Department will consider such factors and determine whether construction could reasonably have been completed in a materially shorter period of time.

               (2) for any application for a Preliminary Certificate of Eligibility that is filed after June 24, 2012, and that is not filed with respect to a project that was the subject of mortgage foreclosure proceedings or other lien enforcement litigation by a lender on or before June 24, 2012: (A) if a project consists of one multiple dwelling and such multiple dwelling is completed within thirty-six (36) months from the later to occur of (1) the date of the installation of a new metal or concrete structure or of the beginning of the actual construction of the conversion, alteration or improvement of the pre-existing building or structure, respectively, (2) the date upon which a building or alteration permit for the multiple dwelling (based upon architectural and structural plans approved by the Department of Buildings) was issued by such department, or (3) December 28, 2007, such multiple dwelling shall be deemed to have been completed without undue delay, and (B) if a project meets the requirements of clause (ii) of this paragraph (2), if all of the multiple dwellings in such multibuilding project are completed within thirty-six (36) months from the later to occur of (1) the date of the installation of a new metal or concrete structure for the first multiple dwelling in such multibuilding project or of the beginning of the actual construction of the conversion, alteration or improvement of the first pre-existing building or structure in such multibuilding project, respectively, (2) the date upon which a building or alteration permit for the first multiple dwelling (based upon architectural and structural plans approved by the Department of Buildings) was issued by such department, or (3) December 28, 2007, all of the multiple dwellings in such multibuilding project shall be deemed to have been completed without undue delay.

               (3) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, if a multiple dwelling meets the affordability requirement or is located outside of the GEA, such multiple dwelling shall be deemed to have been completed without undue delay.

      (c) Where it is determined in accordance with this definition of "commence" that a multiple dwelling commenced construction on or after December 28, 2007 with respect to paragraph five of subdivision (b) of this section or July 1, 2008 with respect to paragraphs one, three or six of subdivision (b) of this section, respectively, this definition of "commence" shall supersede the definition of "commencement of construction" contained in 28 RCNY § 6-01.

   (2) a registration statement has been filed with the Department's Office of Code Enforcement by the new owner, or proof that registration is not required for or allowed to be filed by the applicant.

(c) A new owner seeking a stay or an extension thereof may submit in support of the application any additional statements, information, documents, affidavits, records or reports as he or she may consider desirable to assist the Department in reaching its determination as to whether a stay or an extension thereof should be granted or the length of such stay or extension thereof.

*§ 13-04 Determination of Stay.* ::


Upon application by a new owner, the Department shall make a determination as to whether a stay shall be granted. The Department may take into consideration in determining whether to grant a stay, and the new owner may submit in attempting to establish his or her entitlement to a stay, the following information:

(a) That the new owner has demonstrated, by his or her past and present conduct, that there is a substantial probability that he or she will utilize a postponement to achieve correction of each violation for which a stay is sought. In assessing whether the past conduct of the new owner demonstrates that such a substantial probability exists, the following information may be considered:

   (1) whether the new owner has complied with prior orders of the Department;

   (2) whether the new owner has complied with prior orders of other City departments concerning building conditions;

   (4) what the new owner is doing to correct other violations for which he or she is not seeking a stay.

(b) The financial ability of the new owner to achieve correction of each violation for which a stay is sought. Following a new owner's application for a stay, the Department shall prepare a written statement setting forth the reasons for the granting or the denial of such application. The statement shall be signed and dated by the person making the determination and shall be made part of the records of the Department. A copy of the determination shall be delivered to the new owner or mailed to him or her by regular mail.






*§ 13-05 Length of Stay.* ::


The length of a stay shall be set by the Department and shall be for a period or periods of time that will provide the new owner with a reasonable time to achieve correction of each violation which is the subject of the application for a stay. In any case, the length of such stay or stays shall be no less than the time allowed by classification pursuant to § 27-2115(a) of the Housing Maintenance Code, said time running from the date of the new owner's application for a stay. In determining the appropriate length of time for a stay, the Department may consider:

(c) The proposed course of action which the new owner will undertake to achieve correction;

(e) The financial ability of the new owner to achieve correction of violations.






*§ 13-06 Written Agreement and Condition of Stay.* ::


(a) In the event the Department determines that a stay could appropriately be granted to the new owner, the Department shall require the new owner to execute an agreement prepared by the Department which shall set forth an exact schedule of removal of all violations for which the new owner is seeking a stay and in which the new owner acknowledges his or her responsibility to correct each violation by those dates. Such agreement may also:

   (1) require the new owner to take a particular course of action to correct specified violations;

   (2) require a new owner to deposit the rental income of the subject building into an escrow account from which expenditures for scheduled repairs are made; and

   (3) may contain other conditions, as the Department finds appropriate, including repayment of Emergency Repair Program expenditures.

(b) In the event the Department determines, after consideration of information described in 28 RCNY § 13-04, that a stay might be granted but that a further assurance of violation removal is required from the new owner, a stay may be granted on the condition that the new owner accept service of a summons and complaint or a summons with notations and agree to allow the agreement described in 28 RCNY § 13-06(a) above to be entered in the New York City Civil Court as an order of that court.

(c) If the Department reasonably concludes from the data submitted that the new owner will acquire additional funds, or may be able to acquire the necessary financing from a particular lending institution or type of lending institution to which the new owner has not applied, the Department may require the new owner to make one or more applications for such financing as a condition precedent to the granting of a stay. The Department shall grant an interim stay sufficient in length for a reply, in the ordinary course of business, to any such application upon the condition that the new owner shall inform the Department of such a reply within five (5) days of its receipt. The Department shall make a final determination as to whether a stay shall be granted upon receiving such information or upon an expiration of the interim stay.






*§ 13-07 Extension of Stay.* ::


In the event a new owner shall apply for an extension of a stay previously granted, the Department may grant such stay if the new owner:

(a) Makes an application for such extension at least five (5) days prior to the expiration of the correction date set forth in the agreement described in 28 RCNY § 13-06;

(b) Clearly demonstrates to the Department that:

   (1) the inability to correct in a timely manner was caused by circumstances substantially beyond the control of the new owner, or that the impediments were not reasonably foreseeable at the time the new owner applied for and was granted the original stay;

   (2) no course of action, other than the one undertaken by the new owner could have achieved correction within the time set forth in the original stay agreement; and,

   (3) the new owner has devised a reasonable course of action which he or she intends to pursue if an extension of the stay is granted by the Department, which course of action would remove or circumvent any impediments to correction within the time allowed for an extension of the stay;

(c) Submits any data or information requested by the Department which may include the following:

   (1) any information described in 28 RCNY §§ 13-05 or 13-07(b);

   (2) documentation of the actions taken to achieve correction, including receipted bills and/or cancelled checks for any work performed or materials supplied;

   (3) a statement by the new owner as to the impediments to correction which presently exist; or,

   (4) such additional information of any nature as the Department may request to assist it in making a determination as to whether and how long an extension in the stay should be granted; and

(d) Executes an agreement prepared by the Department which sets forth an exact schedule of removal of all violations for which the new owner is seeking an extension of a stay and in which the new owner acknowledges the new dates for correction and his or her responsibility to correct by those dates and, where applicable or required, consents to the extension agreement being entered as an amendment to an order of the New York City Civil Court.






*§ 13-08 Revocation of Stay and Effect Thereof.* ::


(a) The Department shall have the power to revoke a stay or an extension of a stay by notice to the new owner given by certified mail, return receipt requested, in the event of:

   (1) discovery of misrepresentation or fraud in an application for a stay or an extension of a stay; or,

   (2) failure by a new owner to adhere to the terms of any part or all of either an agreement for a stay described in 28 RCNY § 13-06 or an agreement for an extension of a stay described in 28 RCNY § 13-07.

(b) In the event that the Department revokes a stay or an extension of a stay:

   (1) the new owner shall be liable for full civil penalties as provided by law; and,

   (2) such revocation shall not affect a new owner's responsibility to remove violations at the subject building, and, where an agreement executed under 28 RCNY §§ 13-06 or 13-07 has been entered as an order of the New York City Civil Court, the schedule of removal of violations contained therein.






*§ 13-09 Effect of Compliance.* ::


If the new owner properly and substantially corrects the violations for which a stay is granted, the Department may, in its discretion, recommend to the Office of the Comptroller waiver of any potential causes of action for civil penalties which have accrued pursuant to the Housing Maintenance Code for the violations which have been corrected pursuant to the stay agreement. If the Office of the Comptroller approves such waiver, a written statement of such waiver, signed and dated by the person making such waiver and indicating the Comptroller's approval, shall be made part of the records of the Department. Any such waiver shall be binding and irrevocable.






*§ 13-10 Severability.* ::


In the event that any section or portion of this chapter shall be held invalid or unenforceable for any reason, it shall not in any way invalidate, affect or impair the remaining sections of this chapter.

Such additional payment shall include the following elements:

      (i) The amount, if any, which when added to the amount of condemnation award or purchase price (if by negotiation) of the dwelling acquired by the City of New York, equals the reasonable cost of a comparable replacement dwelling which is decent, safe and sanitary dwelling adequate to accommodate such displaced person, reasonably accessible to public services and places of employment and available on the private market.

      (ii) The amount, if any, which will compensate such displaced person for any increased interest costs which such person is required to pay for financing the acquisition of any such comparable replacement dwelling. Such amount shall be paid only if the dwelling acquired by the City of New York was encumbered by a bonafide mortgage which was a valid lien on such dwelling for not less than 180 days prior to the acquisition of dwelling. Such amount shall be equal to the excess in the aggregate interest and other debt service costs of the amount of the principal of the mortgage on the replacement dwelling which is equal to the unpaid balance of the mortgage on the acquired dwelling, over the remainder term of the mortgage on the acquired dwelling, reduced to discounted present value. The discount rate shall be the prevailing interest rate paid on saving deposits by commercial banks in the general area in which the replacement dwelling is located.

      (iii) Reasonable expenses incurred by such displaced person for evidence of title, recording fees and other closing costs incidents to the purchase of the replacement dwelling, but not including prepared expenses.

         (B) The Comparative Method: The cost of comparable unit is determined on a case by case basis through the use of the sales price (together with any adjustments necessary to reflect the market sales experience) of one or more dwelling determined to be the most representative of the acquired dwelling and conforming to the definition of "comparable replacement housing". The comparable dwellings may be selected by the Relocation Agency, or by the displaced person with the approval of the Relocation Agency.

      (ii) Limitations.

         (B) If the displaced person, of his own volition, purchases and occupies, a decent, safe and sanitary dwelling at a price less than the average sale price, as above, of a comparative replacement dwelling, the differential payment will be reduced to that amount required to pay the difference between the acquisition price of the acquired dwelling and the actual purchase price of the replacement dwelling.

         (C) If the dwelling unit occupied by the claimant was part of a structure owned by the claimant which also included space used for non-residential or multi-residential purposes, the amount of the differential payment shall be determined by using as the acquisition payment of the dwelling unit only that part of the total payment which relates to the value of the claimant's residential use portion of the structure.

         (D) When an eligible claimant, who has received all or a portion of a rental assistance payment (because he elected to rent), subsequently files a claim for replacement housing payment for homeowners, the total amount of the rental assistance payment he has received must be deducted from the amount of the payment to which he may be entitled.

   (2) In addition to amounts otherwise authorized, the Relocation Agency shall make a payment to or for any displaced person from any dwelling not eligible to receive a payment under subdivision (k) of this section which dwelling was actually and lawfully occupied by such displaced person for not less than 90 days prior to the acquisition of such dwelling. Tenant or other occupant of the property shall be notified of the actual date of title vesting in the City.

   (3) Payment under subdivision (n) shall be either:

      (i) The amount necessary to enable such displaced person to lease or rent for a period not to exceed 4 years, a decent, safe, and sanitary dwelling of standards adequate to accommodate such person in areas not generally less desirable in regard to public and commercial facilities, and reasonably accessible to his place of employment, but not to exceed $4,000, or

      (ii) The amount necessary to enable such person to make a down payment and including incidental expenses described in subdivision (m)(3) of this section (incidental expense), on the purchase of a decent, safe, and sanitary dwelling of standards adequate to accommodate such person in areas not generally less desirable in regard to public and commercial facilities, but not exceeding $4,000 except that, if such amounts exceed $2,000 such person must equally match any such amount in excess of $2,000 in making the down payment.

         (A) The displaced person is required to apply all of the portion of the total down payment which was not needed to meet the cost of incidental expenses, toward the purchase of the dwelling.

         (B) The down payment for the replacement housing shall be limited to that amount which would normally be required for a conventional loan, unless otherwise approved by the head of the Relocation Agency, or his designee.

   (4) An owner-occupant otherwise eligible for payment of a Homeowners Replacement Housing Payment but who rents instead of purchases a replacement dwelling is eligible for replacement housing payment for tenants.

Replacement housing payment under the schedule method is computed by determining the amount necessary to rent a suitable replacement dwelling unit for 4 years (the average monthly cost from the schedule) or the new actual rent paid, whichever is lower, and subtracting from such amount 48 times the average month's rent paid by the displaced tenant in the last 3 months prior to condemnation if such rent is reasonable, or if not reasonable, 48 times the monthly economic rent for the dwelling unit as established by the Relocation Agency. For purpose of these regulations, economic rent is defined as the amount of rent the displaced tenant would have had to pay for a similar dwelling unit in areas not generally less desirable than the dwelling unit to be acquired.

   (3) Comparative method. The cost of a comparable unit may be determined on a case-by-case basis by using the average month's rent for one or more dwellings determined to be the most representative of the acquired dwelling conforming to the definition of "comparable replacement housing." The comparable dwellings may be selected by the Relocation Agency, or by the displaced person with the approval of the Relocation Agency. The payment is to be computed by determining the amount necessary to rent for 4 years a suitable replacement dwelling or the new actual rent paid, whichever is lower, and substracting from the amount so determined the lesser of 48 times the average month's rent paid by the displaced tenant in the last 3 months prior to initiation of condemnation, or if not reasonable, 48 times the monthly economic rent for the dwelling unit established by the Relocation Agency.

   (4) Exceptions.

      (i) The head of the Department of Housing Preservation and Development may establish the average month's rent by using more than 3 months, if he deems it advisable.

      (ii) Notwithstanding any of the provisions herein, payments for persons displaced on or after the effective date of this regulation shall not exceed 48 times the difference between the base monthly rental and the lesser of (A) the comparable monthly rental (whether Comparative or Schedule) for a replacement dwelling or (B) the actual monthly rental for the replacement dwelling into which the displaced person is relocated. The $4,000 limitation shall as apply.

   (5) Disbursement of rental replacement housing payment. All rental replacement housing payments in excess of $500 will be made in 4 equal installments on an annual basis. Before making each installment payment, the Relocation Agency must verify that the tenant is in decent, safe and sanitary housing.

(p) Replacement housing payment to purchaser. If the tenant elects to purchase instead of rent, the payment shall be computed by determining the amount necessary to enable him to make a down payment and to cover incidental expenses on the purchase of replacement housing.

   (1) The down payment shall be the amount necessary to make a down payment on a suitable replacement dwelling. Determination on the amount "necessary" for such down payment shall be based on down payment that would be required for a conventional loan.

   (2) Incidental expenses of closing the transaction are those as described in subdivision (m)(3) of this section.

   (3) The full amount of the down payment must be applied to the purchase price and such down payment and incidental costs shown on the closing statement.

(q) Computation of replacement housing payment for certain others.

The payment shall be computed in the same manner as indicated in subdivision (o) of this section except that the present rental rate for the original dwelling shall be the economic rent as determined by market data.

   (2) A displaced owner-occupant who does not qualify for a replacement housing payment under subdivision (k) herein, because of the 180 day occupancy requirement and elects to rent, is eligible for rental replacement housing not to exceed $4,000. The payment will be computed in the same manner as indicated herein, except that the present rental rate for the original dwelling shall be the economic rent as determined by market data.

   (3) A displaced owner-occupant who does not qualify for a replacement housing payment under subdivision (k) herein because of the 180 day occupancy requirement and elects to purchase a replacement dwelling, is eligible for a replacement housing downpayment and closing cost not to exceed $4,000. The payment will be computed in the same manner as shown herein.

The Tenant shall be responsible, at the Tenant's expense, for all repairs and replacement whenever the need results from any act or neglect of the Tenant or Guest.

(e) Improvements. The Tenant and the Guest shall make neither improvements nor alterations without the DAMP Lessee's prior written consent. Any and all such improvements or alterations shall, upon installation, become the property of the DAMP Lessee at the option of the DAMP Lessee, if approved by HPD. Improvements or alterations of any kind or nature built or placed within the apartment by the Tenant or Guest during the Lease Term shall be removed by the Tenant before the termination of the lease term at the option of the DAMP Lessee. If the Tenant fails to remove such improvements or alterations from his or her apartment at the direction of the DAMP Lessee or fails to repair any damages or defacement to the apartment caused by such removal or construction by the end of the lease term, the Tenant shall be and remain liable to the DAMP Lessee for all costs incurred by the DAMP Lessee in removing same from the apartment and all costs incurred by the DAMP Lessee to repair any damage or defacement to the apartment as a result thereof after the Tenant's lease term has expired.

The DAMP Lessee shall only be liable for loss, expense or damage to any person or property due to the DAMP Lessee's negligence. The Tenant shall reimburse the DAMP Lessee for any expenses incurred or loss suffered by the DAMP Lessee, as a result of the action or inaction of the Tenant or Guest.

(h) Entry to Apartment.

   (1) The DAMP Lessee and its agents may (but shall not be obligated to) enter the Tenant's apartment at any time in case of an emergency, and at any reasonable hour to: repair, inspect, exterminate, improve or perform other work, including rehabilitation to the apartment or building determined to be necessary by the DAMP Lessee. The DAMP Lessee may take into the Tenant's apartment all materials and equipment required for such purposes.

   (2) The Tenant shall furnish unhindered access to the DAMP Lessee and its agents to all areas of the Tenant's apartment and building for the purpose of making tests or repairs.

(i) Assignment and Sublease. The Tenant may not assign the Tenant's tenancy rights, or the Tenant's lease, or sublet the Tenant's apartment or grant any license as to the whole or any part, without first obtaining the written permission of the DAMP Lessee. If the Tenant shall assign such tenancy rights or such lease or sublet the Tenant's apartment or any part thereof, without the written consent of the DAMP Lessee, the Tenant's tenancy may be terminated. Any permitted assignment of tenancy rights or of the Tenant's lease or sublet of the apartment shall not relieve or release Tenant from any obligations under these Conditions of Tenancy. Any subtenant or assignee shall be bound by and be subject to all the terms of these Conditions of Tenancy. In the event that the Tenant's tenancy rights or lease is terminated for any reason, it shall be the duty of the Tenant to remove any subtenants. The DAMP Lessee may collect rent from the assignee, subtenant or occupant if the Tenant fails to pay the rent. The DAMP Lessee shall credit the amount collected against the rent owed by the Tenant. However, the DAMP Lessee's acceptance of such rent does not change the status of the assignee, subtenant or occupant to that of a direct Tenant of the DAMP Lessee.

(j) Notices. Any bill, statement or notice must be in writing. If to the Tenant, it must be delivered or mailed to the Tenant at the Tenant's apartment or such other address as the Tenant designates. If to the DAMP Lessee, it must be mailed to the DAMP Lessee's address.

(o) Application of Arrears. If the Tenant pays to the DAMP Lessee less than the full monthly rent, any subsequent payments shall first be applied to arrears. The DAMP Lessee's acceptance of partial or full payment of rent or failure to insist in any one or more cases upon the strict performance of any of the Tenant's obligations shall not be construed as a waiver or relinquishment for the future of such obligation, right or remedy.

(p) Rules. The Tenant shall observe and comply with such rules as the DAMP Lessee, with HPD's prior approval, may determine are needed for the safety, care and cleanliness of the Tenant's apartment and building and the comfort, quiet and convenience of other occupants of the building.

In lieu of the above method, completely remove all combustible material from plaster face of partitions on hall side and repair existing plaster. After inspection, plaster boards or perforated rock lath may be applied directly over the existing plaster face of partitions on hall side. Cover plaster boards or perforated rock lath with two coats of gypsum mortar as above, or plaster boards may be covered with No. 26 U.S. gauge stamped metal.

   (3) Mineral wool. Fill solidly between partition uprights, from underside of flooring to ceiling with mineral wool blown in place by the pneumatic method, packed solidly to fill all spaces and voids.

   (4) Brick, gypsum, etc. Fill solidly between partition uprights from underside of flooring to ceiling with brick, gypsum, or other acceptable material packed solidly to fill all spaces and voids. Where brick, gypsum, or other masonry material is intended to be used, application must be filed before installation with the Department of Buildings for approval of strength of existing members intended to support the proposed masonry fire-retarding.

   (5) Other methods. No other method may be used unless same is acceptable to the Department of Buildings.

   (6) Removal of windows in public hall partitions. When windows in walls or partitions are removed, both sides of the openings shall be sealed with fire-retarding materials, except that wood lath and plaster may be used on the room side of the opening when the existing surface of the room is constructed of wood lath and plaster.

   (2) Where, in any old law tenement, the number of apartments is being increased on one or more stories, door openings into public halls, entrance halls or stair halls on each story or stories shall be equipped with self-closing protective assemblies having a fire-resistive rating of at least one hour. In such old law tenements existing wood doors opening into public halls, entrance halls or stair halls may remain on any story where there is no increase in the number of apartments, provided such doors and every transom and panel in same are made to conform to the requirements set forth in paragraph (1) of subdivision (h) of this section.

   (3) All doors shall be properly fitted to their assemblies and there shall be no unnecessary spaces between doors and door bucks or saddles.

(i) Materials. All materials used in the process of fire-retarding shall be of a type and manufacture acceptable to the Department of Buildings. The following shall be considered as minimum requirements:

   (1) Metal lath. Metal lath shall weigh at least 30 pounds per square yard, except lath used over existing plaster which lath shall weigh at least 3.4 pounds per square yard and be reinforced with rigid ribs not less than three eights inch (3/8") deep, spaced not more than eight (8") on center running full length of sheets. Where ribs exceed 4.8 inches on center, same shall have at least one intermediate one eight inch (1/8") inverted rib running the full length of sheets. Metal lath fastened to stubs shall be attached at least at six inch (6") intervals with 4-penny nails or one inch (1") roofing nails or No. 14 steel wire gauge wire staples, and to wood joists by at least 6-penny nails, one and one-quarter inch (1  1/4") roofing nails, or one inch (1") No. 14 steel wire gauge wire staples. When metal lath is applied over existing plastered surfaces, same shall be fastened with nails or staples of the same gauge and such nails or staples have anchorage of at least one-half inch (1/2")in studs and three-quarters inch (3/4") in joists. Laps between the studs or joists shall be securely tied or laced. Stiffened metal lath on wood studs, or joists, shall be nailed or stapled at least at eight inch (8") intervals, and the laps between studs similarly tied or laced. Metal lath shall be galvanized or painted.

   (2) Plaster boards or perforated rock lath. Plaster boards or perforated rock lath shall be of type and manufacture acceptable to the Department of Buildings. Each board shall bear the name of manufacturer and brand stamped thereon for inspection after erection. Plaster boards or perforated rock lath nailed directly to wood studding or joists shall be fastened with one and one-eighth inches (1  1/8") wire nails of at least No. 13 steel wire gauge, with flat three-eighth inch (3/8") heads. When such boards are applied over existing plastered surfaces, same shall be fastened with nails of the same gauge and such nails shall have anchorage of at least one-half inch (1/2") in studs and three-quarters inch (3/4") in joists. The maximum space between nails shall be four inches (4"). The joints shall be broken at every other board. The wetting of such boards before plastering is forbidden.

   (3) Stamped metal. Stamped metal shall be No. 26 U.S. gauge (equivalent thickness .018 inches or 3/160 inches) with one inch (1") lapped seams. Size of sheets shall be not more than twenty-four inches by ninety-six inches (24" x 96"), having a selvage consisting of a half-round bead sufficient to create a one inch (1") overlap at both seams. Nailing shall be secured direct to studs or joists with 6-penny smooth box nails (two inches (2") or No. 12 1/2" gauge) with nails on end seams spaced not more than three inches (3")apart. Nailing to plaster is forbidden and in all cases nails shall have anchorage of at least one-half inch (1/2") in studs and three-quarters inch (3/4") in joists. All beads at seam shall be chisel sealed, making a tight joint. All sheets shall be marked "26 U.S. Gauge" for identification and inspection after erection.

   (4) Mineral wool. Mineral wool shall be of a type and manufacture acceptable to the Department of Buildings. Holes shall be cut approximately three inches (3") in diameter through the wood lath and plaster near the ceiling, in the panels between each two adjacent studs. As an alternative, holes may be cut approximately three inches by six inches (3" x 6") on every second stud. Check each stud panel with a weight and line to find out whether there is any obstruction. If any cross-bridging or other obstruction is encountered additional holes shall be cut until access has been gained to all open spaces within the stud panel in all specified partitions. Mineral wool shall then be blown into all spaces by the pneumatic method with air pressure sufficient to pack the insulation to a density acceptable to the Department of Buildings. Mineral wool for this work shall be in bags or containers marked with the manufacturer's name and label specifying its type.

   (5) Other materials. No other material may be used unless same is acceptable to the Department of Buildings.

*§ 25-172 Fire-Retarding of Cellar Ceilings in Old Law Tenements and Converted Dwellings.* ::


(a) Intent. The fire-retarding rules herewith set forth are approved by the Department of Buildings for the existing multiple dwellings where the ceilings of the cellar or other lowest story is required, by § 185 and § 240, subdivision 3, Multiple Dwelling Law, and by § 27-2044, Housing Maintenance Code, to be fire-retarded in a manner approved by the Department of Buildings.

   (1) It is the intent of the law to provide a continuous fire-retarded covering over the entire ceiling of the cellar, or other lowest story, so as to prevent fire communicating with upper stories of a multiple dwelling. Where there is a space less than four feet six inches (4'-6") in height from the ground or floor level to the underside of the first tier of beams, such space shall be considered as an "air space" and not as a cellar. However, when such space opens to a cellar where fire-retarding of the ceiling is required, then such space shall be separated from the cellar with a partition constructed of incombustible material in which there is provided a self-closing door and assembly having a fire-resistive rating of at least one hour. Where the ceiling of the cellar or other lowest story is required to be fire-retarded, all openings in such ceilings for stairways not located directly under a main stair, also openings in ceiling such as pipe shafts, vent shafts, unenclosed dumbwaiter shafts, disused flues, etc., shall be properly closed. (Private stairs within duplex apartments extending into cellar or basement are not required to be enclosed.) New partitions erected to enclose existing stair referred to in the preceding paragraph shall be of incombustible materials. Existing partitions enclosing any such stair will be acceptable where same are of incombustible materials or where same are fire-retarded on both sides in accordance with the methods set forth in or 28 RCNY § 25-171(b)(1) or (2) and with materials conforming with the requirement of 28 RCNY § 25-171(i). Door openings in such enclosure partitions shall be equipped with self-closing protective assemblies having fire-resistive ratings of at least one hour. When existing shafts, including dumbwaiter shafts, extend below the ceiling a distance less than one-half (1/2) the height of the cellar, such shafts shall be considered as being part of the cellar ceiling and the enclosures of said shafts shall be fire-retarded in the same manner as required for cellar ceilings. All existing shafts, including dumbwaiter shafts, which extend below the ceiling a distance more than one-half (1/2) the height of the cellar shall be enclosed with incombustible materials. All shafts referred to in this paragraph shall have adequate cleanout at base consisting of fire-proof self-closing door and assembly having a fire-resistive rating of at least one hour. Where new partitions or enclosures are erected in a cellar they shall be constructed of incombustible materials.

   (2) Wood girders, columns, posts, etc. The fire-retarding material of ceiling of cellar or other lowest story shall be carried down and around all non-fireproof ceiling projections, such as wood girders, etc., which are less than six inches (6" x 6") in diameter. The fire-retarding material also shall be turned down at least three inches (3") on all non-fire-retarding columns, posts, etc., which are less than six inches (6") in diameter.

   (3) Non-fire-retarded cellar partitions. When non-fire-retarded partitions in cellar, or other lowest story, extend to the ceiling, the fire-retarding material of the ceiling shall be turned down at least three inches (3") on said partitions, or the partitions shall be cut off at top to permit the fire-retarding of the ceiling to be continuous. Where, in any old law tenement three (3) stories and basement in height, there is also a cellar under the basement story, the ceiling of such cellar shall be fire-retarded; and also, in any such old law tenement, where the main entrance from the grade is to the first story that portion of the basement ceiling which is directly under the first story entrance hall, public hall and stair hall shall be fire-retarded. In every old law tenement three (3) stories and basement in height with no cellar under the basement, where the main entrance from the grade is to the basement story, the ceiling of the basement story shall be fire-retarded throughout. In any such old law tenement where the main entrance from the grade is to the first story no such fire-retarding will be required.

   (4) Heating appliances. The portion of the ceiling over any furnace, boiler or hot water heater shall be fire-retarded in accordance with the methods set forth in 28 RCNY § 25-171(b)(1) or (2) and such fire-retarding shall extend for a distance of at least four feet (4'-0") beyond the sides and rear, and eight feet (8'-0") in front of such furnace or boiler.

   (5) It is not intended that these rules and regulations in themselves require plans to be filed. However, should any work involve structural changes, then plans are required to be filed in the Department of Buildings and such changes shall be subject to all other rules and regulations applicable thereto.

   (6) Work shall not commence until satisfactory evidence has been submitted to the Department of Buildings that compensation insurance has been obtained in accordance with the provisions of the Workmen's Compensation Law.

(b) Methods. Cellar ceilings shall be fire-retarded according to any of the following methods: Metal lath and cement or gypsum mortar conforming to 28 RCNY § 25-171(b)(1). Plaster boards and gypsum mortar or stamped metal conforming to 28 RCNY § 25-171(b)(2).

No. 26 U.S. gauge stamped metal over existing plastered ceiling, when erected without damage to the plaster. Furring strips are not required, but if used, they shall be metal covered on both sides and on face surface. Stamped metal shall not be applied until after existing plastered ceiling has been inspected and approved by an inspector of the Department of Buildings.

(c) Materials. No other method may be used unless same are acceptable to the Department of Buildings. Materials used shall be in accordance with the provisions of 28 RCNY § 25-171(i)(1), (2) or (3). Mineral wool, brick, gypsum or other masonry fill will not be accepted for fire-retarding cellar ceilings. No other materials may be used unless same are acceptable to the Department of Buildings.






*§ 25-173 Fire-Retarding of Cooking Spaces in all Multiple Dwellings.* ::


(a) Intent. The rules herewith set forth are approved by the Department of Buildings for the protection of cooking spaces under §§ 33 and 176 of the Multiple Dwelling Law. As set forth in § 33 of the Multiple Dwelling Law, nothing in these rules shall be construed as permitting fire-retarding partitions in fireproof multiple dwellings.

(b) Section 33, Multiple Dwelling Law. Except when sprinkler heads are installed in conformity with subdivision (e) of this section, § 33 of the Multiple Dwelling Law requires fire-retarding of cooking spaces in existing and newly constructed class A and class B multiple dwellings.

(c) Ceilings and walls exclusive of doors. Walls and ceilings shall be fire-retarded according to any of the following methods: Metal lath and cement or gypsum mortar conforming to 28 RCNY § 25-171(b)(1). Plaster boards and gypsum mortar or stamped metal conforming to 28 RCNY § 25-171(b)(2).

No. 26 U.S. gauge stamped metal over existing plaster when erected without damage to the plaster. Furring strips are not required, but if used, they shall be metal covered on both sides and on face surface. Stamped metal shall not be applied until after existing plaster has been inspected and approved by an inspector of the Department of Buildings. Materials used shall be in accordance with the provisions of 28 RCNY § 25-171(i)(1), (2) or (3). No other methods or materials may be used unless same are acceptable to the Department of Buildings.

(d) Combustible material. In every cooking space, all combustible material immediately underneath or within one foot of any apparatus used for cooking or warming of food shall be fire-retarded in conformity with the applicable provisions of these rules or covered with asbestos at least three-sixteenths inch (3/16") in thickness and twenty-six gauge metal or with fire-resistive material of equivalent rating. There shall always be at least two feet (2'-0") of clear space above such apparatus.

(e) Sprinkler heads installed in ceilings of cooking spaces in lieu of fire-retarding the ceilings and walls. Where sprinkler heads are installed in the ceilings of cooking spaces in lieu of fire-retarding the ceilings and walls, all of the provisions of subdivisions (a) to (f) of this section inclusive, shall be complied with, except that it will not be required that the fire-retarding of the walls and ceilings of cooking spaces be complied with. Before the installation of sprinkler heads is begun a "Plumbing Repair Slip" shall be filed with and approved by the Department of Buildings. Sprinkler heads shall be of a type and manufacture approved by the Department of Buildings or previously approved by the Board of Standards and Appeals or by the Underwriters Laboratories Limited, and shall have fusible struts constructed to fuse at a temperature not higher than two hundred twelve degrees (212°) Fahrenheit. Every sprinkler head shall bear the year of manufacture clearly on its surface. No sprinkler head may be installed after December 31st of the year following the year of manufacture. There shall be provided at least one (1) sprinkler head for every fifty-nine (59) square feet or fraction thereof of the floor area of the cooking space. Sprinkler heads shall be connected with the water supply of the building through a pipe of at least one-half (1/2) inch inside diameter. Where practicable, sprinkler heads shall be located in an upright position on top of the sprinkler piping. There shall be kept available on the premises at all times a sufficient supply of extra sprinkler heads and also a sprinkler wrench for use to replace promptly any fused or damaged sprinkler heads. Any head which has opened or has been damaged shall be replaced immediately with a good sprinkler head. Painting or kalsomining of sprinkler heads is prohibited.

(f) Cooking spaces constructed after July 1, 1949. Application and plans must be filed with and approved by the Department before any work is started in connection with the construction of any cooking space after July 1, 1949.






*§ 25-174 Fire-Escapes, Fire-Stairs and Fire-Towers.* ::


(a)  Intent. These rules have been approved by the Department of Buildings to supplement the provisions of § 53 of the Multiple Dwelling Law in relation to fire-escapes, fire-stairs, etc. Where fire-escapes serve as a means of exit from other than multiple dwellings, such fire-escapes shall comply with the laws governing such occupancy. The voluntary erection of fire-escapes on private residence buildings or business and residence buildings shall be in conformity with these rules and regulations unless otherwise directed by the Borough Superintendent of the Department of Buildings. It is the intent of these rules to cover only general conditions and they are not designed to cover specific or special cases. When such may occur the owner is required to consult the Department of Buildings and receive instructions before starting of work.

   (1) Fire-escapes on multiple dwellings requiring new certificate of occupancy. Except as provided in paragraph (2) of subdivision (g) of this section re lodging houses, double-rung ladder type fire-escapes will not be accepted when a new certificate of occupancy is required.

   (2) Alterations for increased occupancy. Where an alteration is made increasing occupancy on any story and a fire-escape is required such fire-escape shall conform to the provisions of § 53 of the Multiple Dwelling Law and to the applicable provisions of these rules.

(b) General provisions.

   (1) Caution. No fire-escapes shall be removed from any apartment without due precaution against leaving occupants without fire-escape protection as required by subdivision 9 of § 53 of the Multiple Dwelling Law.

   (2) Entrance story, etc. – second means of egress. Where the distance to safe landing, from the window sill of any apartment on any story, including the entrance story, is more than twelve feet (12'-0"), a balcony and sliding drop-ladder or other approved second means of egress shall be provided for such apartment. Safe egress to street or other safe place shall be provided from the termination of such means of egress.

   (3) Application blanks and plans. Before the erection of new fire-escapes or alteration of existing fire-escapes upon any multiple dwelling, application must be filed with and approved by the Department of Buildings.

   (4) Projections beyond the building line. Every part of fire-escapes or balconies erected on the fronts of multiple dwellings shall be at least ten feet (10') above the sidewalk when such fire-escapes or balconies project beyond the building line.

(c) Illegal fire-escapes shall be removed. All vertical ladder, wire, chain or cable fire-escapes if required as a means of egress shall be removed and replaced with a legal means of egress.

(d) Acceptable existing means of egress on existing multiple dwellings. Except as provided in subdivision (c) of this section, in any existing multiple dwelling any existing means of egress which was lawfully permitted prior to the time the Multiple Dwelling Law became effective may be continued as a legal means of egress as hereinafter enumerated. If located on the front or rear wall of the building and properly connected with stairs with proper openings. If located in an outer court at a point distant not more than thirty feet (30'-0") from the outer end of such court and provided such court is not less than five feet (5'-0") in width from wall to wall at any point between such fire-escape and the outer end of said court. If located in an inner court whose least horizontal dimension is not less than fifteen feet (15'-0") measured from wall to wall. If a party-wall balcony on the front or rear wall of the building and there are no doors or openings in the walls between the two buildings other than windows in fireproof air shafts. If a party-balcony located in an outer court not more than fifteen feet (15'-0") in length measured from the outer end of such court to the innermost point thereof, and not less than five feet (5'-0") in width from wall to wall at any point between the fire-escape and the outer end of said court, and provided also that there are no doors or openings in the walls between the two buildings other than windows in fireproof air-shafts. No fire-escape, however, shall be deemed sufficient unless all the following conditions are complied with: All fire-escapes, whether a required means of egress or not, shall be maintained in good order, repair and structurally safe. All parts shall be of iron or stone. Except as provided in subdivision (bb) of this section every apartment above the ground floor in each multiple dwelling shall have direct access to a legal fire-escape without passing through a public hall. Except party-wall balconies, all balconies shall be connected to each other by means of a stair or, when permitted, by double-rung ladders. All fire-escapes, except party-wall balconies, shall have proper drop-ladders in guides from the lowest balcony of sufficient length to reach a safe landing place beneath. All fire-escapes not on the street shall have a safe and adequate means of egress from the yard or court to the street or the adjoining premises. Prompt and ready access shall be had to all fire-escapes. Except as provided in subdivision (bb) of this section, such access shall be through a living room or private hall in each apartment or suite of rooms at each story above the ground floor and shall not include the window of a stairhall, nor shall any such egress be obstructed by sinks or other kitchen fixtures, or in any other way. No existing fire-escape shall be extended or have its location changed except with the written approval of the Department of Buildings. Where an existing apartment in a tenement house erected prior to April twelfth, nineteen hundred and one, is located entirely on a court and has no rooms opening on the street or yard, fire-escapes hereafter provided for such apartments may be located in courts under the same conditions as prescribed for existing fire-escapes in this subdivision. When wire, chain cable or vertical ladder fire-escapes are permitted to remain on multiple dwellings under the provisions of subdivision 9 of § 53, they shall be considered only as supplemental fire-escapes. Such fire-escapes shall be maintained in a safe condition of repair at all times and shall be subject to the applicable requirements of all laws and to these rules in relation to maintenance of existing fire-escapes. Before a pending violation requiring the removal of such existing fire-escapes is superseded or cancelled, an inspection shall be made in accordance with the specific requirements as set forth in the preceding paragraph. Each of the owners of adjoining structures, commonly served by party-wall balconies serving as a required means of egress, shall maintain in good order and repair that portion of each such balcony which is on his property, and each such owner shall maintain egress normally unobstructed and unimpeded from each such balcony to and through his structure. It shall be unlawful for the owner of a structure on which there is a party-wall balcony serving as a required means of egress from an adjoining structure, to remove such party-wall balcony or any portion thereof or to prevent, eliminate or obstruct egress from such party-wall balcony to and through his structure, unless and until such owner has had erected a legal fire-escape or other approved means of egress. See also subdivision (bb) of this section.

(e) Party-wall balconies.

   (1) New party-wall balconies. The erection of new party-wall balconies shall be subject to the discretion and jurisdiction of the Department of Buildings, provided, however, that there shall be no doors or openings in the wall between the buildings served by such balconies other than windows in fireproof airshafts. New party-wall balconies will not be permitted on adjoining frame multiple dwellings.

   (2) Existing party-wall balconies. Party-wall balconies existing on any multiple dwelling shall afford safe egress, be kept in good order and repair, be constructed so as to be structurally strong and shall be maintained in conformity with all other applicable laws, rules and regulations. Such fire-escapes are acceptable on occupied multiple dwellings.

(f) Party-wall fire-escapes. The Department of Buildings may consent to the erection of party-wall fire-escapes on adjoining multiple dwellings, to which the occupants have safe, unobstructed access in common, when such party-wall fire-escapes are constructed and maintained in accordance with the law and these rules and regulations.

   (1) Any existing party-wall fire-escape (stairways) connection with and used in common by a multiple dwelling and a non-multiple dwelling is acceptable when such fire-escape is maintained in good order and repair and affords safe egress.

(g) Double-rung ladders.

   (1) Double-rung ladders will not be permitted on new fire-escapes.

   (2) Any fire-escape existing prior to the enactment of the Multiple Dwelling Law on any multiple dwelling that does not require a certificate of occupancy resulting from an alteration, if structurally sound and in good condition and provided with existing ladders inclined at an angle not exceeding eighty (80) degrees and equipped with double-rung steps and which affords safe egress, shall be deemed to be a legal fire-escape. When a certificate of occupancy is requested or required in connection with a lodging house which is equipped with a double-rung ladder fire-escape and such fire-escape is in good repair and adequate, except as to type, and only minor violations exist the correction of which will make the premises conform to all other law requirements, the existing double-rung ladder fire-escape may be accepted.

   (3) Except as provided in paragraph (2) of subdivision (g) of this section re lodging houses, double-rung ladders are not acceptable when a new certificate of occupancy is to be issued.

(h) Alteration of existing two-balcony fire-escapes on existing multiple dwellings. When a building is not more than three (3) stories in height and provided with a balcony on each of the second and third stories, with connecting vertical ladders, and balconies not less than two feet five inches (2'-5") in width and of adequate length, the Department of Buildings may permit the removal of vertical ladders and replacing of the said ladders with regulation sixty (60) degree connecting stairs. Standards shall be one-half inch (1/2") round or square and height of rail at least two feet nine inches (2'-9"). The stairs shall be not less than seventeen inches (17") wide with a passageway between string and wall or string and top rail of not less than fourteen inches (14"). In lieu of such passageway, the Department of Buildings will permit a drop-ladder to be installed and placed at each end of the lowest balcony in those cases where it is impractical to provide a passageway of such minimum width. New brackets shall be provided where necessary. The gateway shall be cut in the front rail with a drop-ladder and guides from second (2nd) story to safe landing. Where fire-escapes are located at rear of building a gooseneck ladder shall be provided. The gooseneck ladder may be placed at an angle from the top floor balcony to the roof. When placed at an angle a minimum space of twenty-four inches (24") shall be maintained between the strings and front top rail and a minimum space of at least twenty-four inches (24") between the string of the gooseneck ladder and the frame of the window. Conditions may be found where this modification will not exactly apply. When such a condition is found it should be brought to the attention of the Department of Buildings for decision. When fire-escapes are at the front no gooseneck ladder shall be required. When access to such existing two-balcony fire-escape is solely by means of a window in a bathroom, the doors of such bathrooms shall be glazed with glass or other than wire glass and all key or cylinder locks shall be removed from doors. In such bathrooms there shall be no fixture located in front of the window opening to fire-escape. Such altered two-balcony fire-escape shall conform to all other requirements of law and these rules and regulations.

(i) Accessibility of fire-escapes from apartments, rooms, kitchenettes and other spaces. Prompt and ready access shall be had to all fire-escapes and, except as provided in subdivision (bb) of this section, such access shall be through a living room, kitchenette or private hall in each apartment or suite of rooms at each story above the ground floor. Access to fire-escapes shall not include the window of a stairhall, nor shall any such egress be obstructed by sinks or other kitchen fixtures, or in any other way. A clear space of at least twenty-one inches (21") must be maintained as a passageway between any fixtures and the side of an opening leading to fire-escapes. In any apartment which is occupied by a "family" as defined in § 4, paragraph 5, Multiple Dwelling Law, and in which one or more living rooms are rented to boarders or lodgers, every such room shall be directly accessible to a fire-escape without passing through a public hall, and for separately occupied living rooms access to fire-escapes shall be direct from such rooms without passing through a public hall or any other separately occupied room, except as may be permitted in sections sixty-six, sixty-seven and two hundred forty-eight of the Multiple Dwelling Law.

   (1) Egress from apartments used for "single room occupancy." No room in any apartment shall be so occupied for "single room occupancy" unless each room therein shall have free and unobstructed access to each required means of egress from the dwelling without passing through any sleeping room, bathroom or water-closet compartment. In apartments used for "single room occupancy" there shall be access to a second means of egress within the apartment without passing through any public stair or public hall. On and after July 1, 1957, every tenement used or occupied for single room occupancy in whole or part under the provisions of § 248, Multiple Dwelling Law, and which does not have at least two means of egress accessible to each apartment and extending from the ground story to the roof, shall be provided with at least two means of egress, or, in lieu of such egress, every stair hall or public hall, and every hall or passage within an apartment, shall be equipped on each story with one or more automatic sprinkler heads approved by the department. Elevator shafts in such tenements shall be completely enclosed with fireproof or other incombustible material and the doors to such shafts shall be fireproof or shall be covered on all sides with incombustible material. In apartments used for "single room occupancy" where access to a required means of egress is provided through a room such access to such room shall be through a clear opening at least thirty inches (30") wide extending from floor to ceiling and such opening shall not be equipped with any door frame, or with any device by means of which the opening may be closed, concealed or obstructed.

(j) Window bars, gates, etc. No iron bars, gates or other obstructing devices will be permitted on any window giving access to fire-escapes or where such window provides a secondary means of egress in case of fire on any story, including the ground floor, basement, cellar, etc. Windows on grade level at sidewalk, yard or court, or a roof level of an adjoining building, may have bars, but at least, one window in any apartment or suite of rooms shall be without bars or obstructions of any kind in order to afford a second means of egress and such window shall conform to the provisions of subdivision (k) of this section.

(k) Windows and doors to fire-escapes. The window or door giving access to fire-escapes shall not be less than two feet (2') in width and the sill of the window shall not be more than three feet (3') above the floor. Window openings shall be not less than two feet six inches (2'-6") high in the clear.

   (1) Steel casement sash. Steel casement sash opening outward onto any fire-escape balcony three feet six inches (3'-6") in width will be permitted, provided such sash is equipped with approved extension hinges so that, when opened, the sash will be flat against the wall, and further provided that there will be no adjusters on the sash as part of its equipment. Passageway of fourteen inches (14") clear width is required to be maintained between the sash or hinges and any portion of the fire-escape when the sash lies flat against the wall. When casement sash is set at right angle to the fire-escape stairway a clear radial width of twenty inches (20") must be provided.

   (2) Wire screens and storm windows. Wire screens are permitted on a door or window giving access to a fire-escape. Such screens may be of the rolling type, casement or of a type that slides vertically or horizontally in sections, providing that there shall be a clear unobstructed space two feet (2') in width and two feet six inches (2'-6") in height when the screens are opened and further provided that no such screen shall be subdivided with muntins or other dividing or separating bars into spaces less than two feet (2') in width by two feet six inches (2'-6") in height. Storm sash and storm doors are permitted on openings giving access to fire-escapes provided they are arranged so as to be easily and readily opened from the inside and do not obstruct or interfere with safe egress.

(l) Egress from fire-escape balconies not to be obstructed. Egress from fire-escape balconies must not be obstructed by signs, fixed awnings or any other obstruction.

(m) Extension roofs used as means of egress or directly under fire-escape balcony.

   (1) Hereafter erected extension roofs. Where the roof of an extension hereafter erected is to be used as a means of egress from a fire-escape, or where a fire-escape balcony is located directly above said roof, such roof shall be of fireproof constuction.

   (2) Existing extension roofs. Except in converted dwellings where sprinklers may be installed, in every multiple dwelling where a fire-escape balcony is situated over and not more than eight feet (8') above a non-fireproof roof, or where a non-fireproof roof of an extension is to be used as egress from fire-escapes, the entire ceiling of said extension must be fire-retarded with metal lath and cement or gypsum mortar in the manner prescribed in 28 RCNY § 25-171(b)(1) and (i)(1), or with one-half inch (1/2") approved plaster boards lined with No. 26 U.S. gauge stamped metal. In buildings requiring the issuance of a certificate of occupancy as a result of being altered structurally, the only approved method shall be with cement of gypsum mortar and metal lath weighing not less than three (3.0) pounds per square yard which shall be applied directly to the beams or other structural members. Where the roof of an existing extension is used as fire egress, a balcony shall be provided at the level of the roof and, if the distance between the said balcony and a safe landing is more than sixteen feet (16'-0"), a landing platform must be provided not more than ten feet (10'-0") from said safe landing and this landing platform and the balcony on the roof level must be connected by a regulation stairway.

Existing fire-escapes shall be repainted whenever deemed necessary, in a manner satisfactory to the Department. Notice shall be given by the owner to the Borough Superintendent prior to the painting of fire-escapes.

(x) Exceptions. Any deviations or exceptions from these rules other than those specifically mentioned herein shall be submitted to the Department of Buildings for approval. Consent and approval shall be in written form and bear the signature of the Commissioner, Deputy Commissioner, Superintendent or the person designated to sign such consent by the Commissioner, Deputy Commissioner or Superintendent.

(y) Fire-escapes on frame buildings. Fire-escapes shall be constructed as for brick or stone buildings with following exceptions, and except also that balconies three feet (3'-0") wide will be acceptable to the Department.

   (1) Brackets. Horizontal members of brackets must be one and three-quarters inches by one-half inch (1 3/4" x 1/2") wrought iron set on edge; one inch (1") bolt end through a four inches by three-eighths inch (4" x 3/8") iron plate, long enough to take in all brackets, secured to and bearing directly on the inside of the studs. Spaces between the studs behind such plates shall be filled in solidly with timber secured to the studs. The heel of bracket braces must rest against one and three-quarter inches by one and three-quarter inches by one-quarter inch (1 3/4" x 1 3/4" x 1/4") angle iron extended across and well secured to studs.

   (2) Top rails. Top rails shall be anchored by three-quarters inch (3/4") bolt ends, through a four inch by three-eighths inch (4" x 3/8") wrought iron plate spanning at least two (2) studs. Space behind plate and between studs shall be blocked solidly.

   (4) Stairways. Stair braces shall be secured to the wall of the building by two (2) No. 14 wood screws.

(z) Outside fireproof stairs. Outside fireproof stairs shall be constructed according to approved plans and applications of the Department of Buildings. Such regulations as govern the measurements of inside stairs shall be applied to outside fireproof stairways except that in multiple dwellings not exceeding three (3) stories and basement in height, a fireproof stairway leading from a front porch roof which is fireproof to the fireproof floor of an unenclosed porch will be deemed an outside fireproof stairway and such stairways may be of the same width as the ordinary fire-escape stairs. Area covered by fireproof outside stairs must not encroach upon the minimum dimensions of yards or courts.

(aa) Fire-towers. Fire-towers shall be constructed according to approved plans and applications filed with the Department of Buildings.

(bb) Egress: hotels and certain other class A and class B dwellings which are subject to the provisions of § 67, Multiple Dwelling Law.

   (1) Exceptions. Any such multiple dwelling, altered or erected after April fifth, nineteen hundred forty-four, and which is required to conform to the provisions of articles one, two, three, four, five, eight, nine and eleven of Multiple Dwelling Law, shall not be required to conform to the provisions of paragraphs (1), (2), (3) and (4) of subdivision (bb) of this section.

      (i) Except in fireproof class A multiple dwellings erected under plans filed after January first, nineteen hundred twenty-five, and which were completed before December thirty-one, nineteen hundred thirty-three, and except as otherwise provided in paragraph (4) of subdivision (bb) of this section, in every such dwelling three (3) or more stories in height there shall be from each story at least two (2) independent means of unobstructed egress located remote from each other and accessible to each room, apartment or suite.

   (2) First means of egress. The first means of egress shall be an enclosed stair extending directly to a street, or to a yard, court or passageway affording continuous, safe and unobstructed access to a street, or by an enclosed stair leading to the entrance story, which story shall have direct access to a street. That area of the dwelling immediately above the street level and commonly known as the main floor, where the occupants are registered and the usual business of the dwelling is conducted, shall be considered a part of the entrance story; and a required stair terminating at such main floor or its mezzanine shall be deemed to terminate at the entrance story. An elevator or unenclosed escalator shall never be accepted as a required means of egress.

   (3) Second means of egress. The second means of egress shall be by an additional enclosed stair conforming to the provisions of paragraph (2) of subdivision (bb) of this section, a fire-stair, a fire-tower or an outside fire-escape. In a non-fireproof dwelling when it is necessary to pass through a stair enclosure which may or may not be a required means of egress to reach a required means of egress, such stair enclosure and that part of the public hall or corridor leading thereto from a room, apartment or suite, shall be protected by one (1) or more sprinkler heads; in a fireproof dwelling only that part of the hall or corridor leading to such stair enclosure need be so protected.

   (4) Required second means of egress – impractical. Where it is impractical in such existing dwellings to provide a second means of egress, the department may order additional alteration to the first means of egress and shafts, stairs and other vertical openings as the department may deem necessary to safeguard the occupants of the dwelling, may require the public hall providing access to the first means of egress to be equipped on each story with one (1) or more automatic sprinkler heads, and, in non-fireproof dwellings may also require automatic sprinkler heads in the stair which serves as the only means of egress.

   (5) Public halls and corridors providing access to fire-escapes. Public halls and corridors providing access to fire-escapes, existing and new, are acceptable when a direct and uninterrupted line to travel to the fire-escape is provided. Public halls and corridors providing access to fire-escapes shall be fire-retarded or shall be equipped with automatic sprinkler heads. The fire-retarding and sprinkler installation shall be in conformity with the rules and regulations of this Department and as required by subdivision 3 of § 67 of the Multiple Dwelling Law. All openings which provide direct access to an existing fire-escape from a public hall or corridor shall be equipped with fireproof doors and assemblies with the doors self-closing or fireproof windows glazed with clear wire glass. Access to new fire-escapes from such halls or corridors shall be by means of fireproof doors and assemblies with doors self-closing. Doors providing access to fire-escapes from public halls or corridors may be glazed with clear wire glass.

   (6) Fire-escapes – existing and new. Existing fire-escapes which are structurally strong and in good repair, having connecting stairways set at an angle or not more than sixty-five (65) degrees, may be accepted as a secondary means of egress. Except as otherwise required herein, new and existing fire-escapes shall be provided with a safe landing and the termination shall lead directly to a street or to a passageway which provides access to a street. When it is impractical to provide a termination for fire-escapes as specified in these rules, the Department may accept a termination from such fire-escapes which leads to safety.

   (7) Supplementary means of egress. A stair, fire-stair, fire-tower, or fire-escape which is supplementary to the egress requirements of paragraphs (2), (3) and (4) of subdivision (bb) of this section, need not lead to the entrance story or to a street, or to a yard or a court which leads to a street, provided the means of egress therefrom is approved by the department. Fire-escapes which are supplementary to the required second means of egress, including fire-escapes of the inclined ladder and vertical ladder types, may remain on the dwelling if maintained in good order and repair, are structurally strong and safe and are provided with safe landing and the termination thereof leads to safety in a manner satisfactory to this Department.

   (8) Signs – supplementary means of egress. Supplementary stairs, fire-stairs, fire-towers or fire-escapes which do not lead to the entrance story or to a street, or to a yard or court leading to a street, shall be clearly marked "NOT AN EXIT" in black letters at least four inches (4") high on a yellow background and at the termination of each such stair, fire-stair, fire-tower or fire-escape, there shall be a directional sign indicating the nearest means of egress leading to a street. All signs shall be constructed, located and illuminated in a manner satisfactory to the department.

   (9) Signs – general provisions. Every means of egress shall be indicated by a sign reading "EXIT" in red letters at least eight inches (8") high on a white background, or vice versa, illuminated at all times during the day and night by a red light of at least twenty-five (25) watts or equivalent illumination. Such light shall be maintained in a keyless socket. On all stories where doors, openings or passageways giving access to any means of egress are not visible from all portions of such stories, directional signs shall be maintained in conspicuous locations, indicating in red on a white background, or vice versa, the direction of travel to the nearest means of egress. At least one sign shall be visible from the doorway of each room or suite of rooms. Existing signs and illumination may be accepted if, in the opinion of the department, such existing signs and illumination serve the intent and purpose of this subdivision.

   (10) Stairs, fire-stairs and fire-towers. Stairs, fire-stairs and fire-towers hereafter provided shall be constructed according to plans and applications approved by the Department of Buildings.

(cc) Egress: lodging houses. 

   (1) Arrangement. There shall be at least two (2) means of unobstructed egress from each lodging-house story, which shall be remote from each other. The first means of egress shall be to a street either directly or by an enclosed stair having unobstructed direct access thereto. If the story is above the entrance story, the second means of egress shall be by an outside fire-escape constructed in accordance with the provisions of section fifty-three, Multiple Dwelling Law, or by an additional enclosed stair. Such second means of egress shall be accessible without passing through the first means of egress.

   (2) Doors and windows. All doors opening upon entrance halls, stair halls, other public halls or stairs, or elevator, dumbwaiter or other shafts, and the door assemblies, shall be fireproof with the doors made self-closing by a device approved by the department, and such doors shall not be held open by any device whatever. All openings on the course of a fire-escape shall be provided with such doors and assemblies or with fireproof windows and assemblies, with the windows self-closing and glazed with wire glass, such doors or windows and their assemblies to be acceptable to the department.

   (3) Aisles. There shall be unobstructed aisles providing access to all required means of egress in all dormitories. Main aisles, approved as such by the department to provide adequate approaches to the required means of egress, shall be three feet (3'-0") or more in width, except that no aisles need be more than two feet six inches (2'-6") wide if it it is intersected at intervals of not more than fifty feet (50'-0") by cross-over aisles at least three feet (3'-0") wide leading to other aisles or to an approved means of egress.

   (4) Signs. Every required means of egress from the lodging-house part of the dwelling shall be indicated by a sign reading "EXIT" in red letters at least eight inches (8") high on a white background illuminated at all times during the day and night by a light of at least twenty-five (25) watts or equivalent illumination. Such light shall be maintained in a keyless socket. On all lodging-house stories where doors, openings, passageways or aisles are not visible from all portions of such stories, and in other parts of the dwelling which may be used in entering or leaving the lodging-house part and in which a similar need exists, signs with easily readable letters at least eight inches (8") in height, and continuously and sufficiently illuminated by artificial light at all times when the natural light is not sufficient to make them easily readable, shall be maintained in conspicuous locations, indicating the direction of travel to the nearest means of egress. At least one (1) such sign shall be easily visible from the doorway of each cubicle.

   (5) Roof egress. Access from the public hall at the top story to the roof shall be provided by means of a bulkhead or a scuttle acceptable to the department. Every such scuttle and the stair or ladder leading thereto shall be located within the stair enclosure.

   (6) Persons accommodated. The number of persons accommodated on any story in a lodging-house shall not be greater than the sum of the following components:

      (i) Twenty-two (22) persons for each full multiple of twenty-two inches (22") in the smallest clear width of each means of egress approved by the department, other than a fire-escape.

      (ii) Twenty persons (20) for each lawful fire-escape accessible from such story if it is above the entrance story.

   (7) In view of the fact that § 66, subdivision 3 (formerly § 13, subdivision m), Multiple Dwelling Law, required lodging-houses to be sprinklered throughout, including public halls, the Department will accept existing double-rung ladder type fire-escapes on the condition that such fire-escapes are maintained in a good state of repair.

(dd) Ladders leading to roof scuttles. Ladders to roof scuttles as required under the provisions of§§ 187 and 233 of the Multiple Dwelling Law, shall be of incombustible material, not less than fifteen inches (15") wide, with strings not less than one and one-half inches by three-eighths inch (1 1/2" x 3/8"), with five-eighths inch (5/8") rungs not more than twelve inches (12") apart. Strings of such ladders shall be secured at top and bottom and ladder must be so arranged as to permit sufficient toe hold.

(b) Height and service openings. Refuse chutes shall extend from the refuse collection room to a height of at least six feet above the roof. Service openings into the chute shall be equipped with approved self-closing hoppers so constructed that the chute is closed off while the hopper is being loaded and so that no part will project into the chute. The area of the service opening shall not exceed one third the are of the chute. Hopper doors shall have a fire resistive rating of at least one hour, unless separated from the corridor by a fireproof, self-closing door in which case they shall be constructed of incombustible material.

(c) Existing flues and refuse chutes. Flues for existing incinerators may be used for refuse chutes provided such flues are in good condition and provided the flues comply with the provisions of subdivisions (a) and (b) of this section. Existing refuse chutes may be continued in use provided they conform to the provisions of subdivisions (a) and (b) of this section, except that existing refuse chutes of other construction, which have been approved by the department may be retained.

(d) Refuse chutes in new construction. Where refuse compacting systems are required hereafter in new construction, refuse chutes shall be required for conveyance of garbage and rubbish to refuse collection rooms, except that refuse chutes will not be required in class A multiple dwellings which are four stories or less in height.

*§ 26-02 General.* ::


The Department of Housing Preservation and Development of the City of New York (HPD) is responsible for managing, rehabilitating, and disposing of buildings owned by the City of New York that were acquired through tax foreclosure and other means. HPD recognizes that it has not increased rents to commercial tenants on a regular basis and the result is that some businesses pay less to HPD than the cost of similar space leased by competing businesses, thus providing such commercial tenants an unfair competitive benefit.






*§ 26-03 Policy.* ::


It is the policy and intention of HPD that commercial units within city-owned buildings be rented at fair market rents, and that commercial units rented to qualified not-for-profit organizations be rented at 50 percent of fair market rent. However, it is also HPD's policy to minimize the impact of rent restructuring on current tenants, by phasing in rent increases as set forth in these rules.






*§ 26-04 Coverage.* ::


These Rules govern the procedures for the periodic review and resetting of rents in leased commercial units under the jurisdiction of the Division of Property Management and the Division of Relocation Operations.






*§ 26-05 Commercial Rent Restructuring Committee.* ::


There shall be a Commercial Rent Restructuring Committee consisting of two persons designated by the Assistant Commissioner of Property Management, and one person designated by the Assistant Commissioner of Relocation Operations.






*§ 26-06 Periodic Review.* ::


The commercial rent for every leased commercial unit under the jurisdiction of DPM and DRO shall be reviewed not more than once every year. Such review shall be conducted by the Commercial Rent Restructuring Committee.






*§ 26-07 New Rent.* ::


The Commercial Rent Restructuring Committee shall determine the fair market rent of each commercial tenant, other than governmental tenants or community gardens, as determined by HPD. Such fair market rent shall be the new rent for the commercial unit. The new rent for qualified not-for-profit organizations shall be 50 percent of the fair market rent. The rent for governmental tenants shall be the cost of operation of the unit.






*§ 26-08 Phase-In of New Rents of For-Profit Tenants.* ::


(a) Where the Commercial Rent Restructuring Committee determines that the difference between the new rent and the current rent of a commercial unit is an increase of more than 15 percent of the current rent, the Committee shall direct that the new rent be phased in over a period of not more than five (5) years. The current rent of such unit shall be increased each year until the rent shall equal the new rent, but each such increase shall be no more than 15 percent of the prior year's rent for each of the first four years. On the fourth anniversary of the Commercial Rent Restructuring Committee's implementation of the rent increase, the remainder of any difference between the rent then being charged and the new rent shall be the amount of the increase for the final year of the phase-in period.

(b) Notwithstanding subdivision (a) above, in no event shall the first rent increase of the phase-in result in a rent less than:

   (1) 25 percent of FMR or current rent plus 15 percent, whichever is more, for a commercial unit of 1,000 square feet or more; or

   (2) $300 or FMR, whichever is less, for a commercial unit of less than 1,000 square feet.






*§ 26-09 Phase-In of New Rents of Not-For-Profit Tenants.* ::


(a) Where the Commercial Rent Restructuring Committee determines that the difference between the new rent and the current rent of a commercial unit whose tenant is a qualified not-for-profit organization is an increase of more than 10 percent of the current rent, the Committee shall direct that the new rent be phased in. The current rent of such unit shall be increased each year until the rent shall equal the new rent, but each such increase shall be no more than 10 percent of the prior year's rent for each of the first five years. On the fifth anniversary of the Commercial Rent Restructuring Committee's implementation of the rent increase, the rent shall increase by 15 percent each year until the rent charged shall equal the new rent.

(b) Notwithstanding subdivision (a) above, in no event shall the first rent increase of the phase-in result in a rent less than $150.






*§ 26-10 Reconsideration of Rent During Phase-In Period.* ::


Where a tenant has received a rent increase eligible for a phase-in under 28 RCNY § 26-08, the Commercial Rent Restructuring Committee may not review such rent again until the phase-in provided for under 28 RCNY § 26-08 has been completed or five years have elapsed since the commencement of a phase-in.






*§ 26-11 Termination of Phase-In.* ::


If there is a sale of the business occupying a commercial unit, or a termination of the tenancy, any previously determined phase-in under 28 RCNY § 26-08 or 28 RCNY § 26-09 shall terminate immediately and the rent for the unit shall be the fair market rent as determined by HPD's staff, or by auction.






*§ 26-12 30-Day Notice.* ::


The Commercial Rent Restructuring Committee shall notify the tenant of the new rent, and of the phase-in schedule, if any, at least 30 days prior to the effective date of such new rent.






*§ 26-13 Appeal.* ::


(a) There shall be a Commercial Rent Restructuring Appeals Committee which shall consist of the Assistant Commissioner of the Division of Property Management, the Assistant Commissioner of the Division of Relocation Operations and one person designated by HPD's General Counsel. An Assistant Commissioner may be represented on the Appeals Committee by an individual designated by such Assistant Commissioner who reports directly to such Assistant Commissioner, provided that such designee did not also serve as a designee in the Commercial Rent Restructuring Committee's decision to set the rent which is appealed from.

(b) The tenant of a commercial unit for which a new rent has been determined shall have the right to state their objections to the Appeals Committee in writing. Such objections may be received at any time up to 60 days after the effective date of the rent increase. However, the filing of such objections shall not postpone the effective date of the new rent, or of any other action that HPD may take with regard to the commercial unit.






*§ 26-14 Postponement of Effective Date.* ::


The Appeals Committee shall consider objections promptly. If the Appeals Committee is not scheduled to convene within the next 30 days, the Assistant Commissioner of the Division which has jurisdiction over the commercial unit may postpone the effective date of the new rent until after the next scheduled Appeals Committee meeting.






*§ 26-15 Final Determination.* ::


The determination by the Appeals Committee of any objections by a tenant to a rent restructuring shall be final.

(a) General. This 28 RCNY § 28-03 sets forth standards for the selection of community groups to receive syndication funds for projects. Such determinations shall be made by the agency, in accordance with the standards set forth herein, for the purposes of (i) ascertaining whether a community group meets the requirements of the program and has the ability to perform the project, and (ii) furthering the best interests of the city. The agency may select a community group to receive syndication funds by any method permitted by law which it determines will best meet the program's objectives, including, but not limited to, sole source, application, RFP, selection by a process mandated by an entity other than the agency, and selection by an entity other than the agency.

(b) Grandfathered selection. Notwithstanding any provision of these rules to the contrary, the agency may select:

   (1) Any community group which was the co-sponsor of a development; or

   (2) Any community group with which it began to negotiate before the date upon which the guidelines ceased to be effective; or

   (3) Any community group which was selected by a developer in accordance with an agreement prior to the agency's use of EDA's as if, and to the same extent as if, such community group had been selected by the agency pursuant to these rules.

(c) Sole source. Where the agency deems it to be necessary or desirable, a community group may be selected to receive syndication funds without any competitive process. In such event, the agency shall, prior to taking any action with respect to disbursement of such syndication funds, prepare a written statement signed by the commissioner setting forth the reasons why a more competitive process was not appropriate or desirable. Such statement shall thereafter be placed with the records concerning the project which are retained by the agency and shall be kept on file in accordance with the agency's usual record retention procedures.

(d) Application. Where and at such time as the agency deems it to be necessary or desirable, a community group may be selected via an application process.

   (1) Distribution. 

      (i) Notice. At such time as the agency commences an application process for selection of one or more community groups, the agency shall place advertisements in The City Record and such other publications as the agency shall deem appropriate. The advertisement shall include, at a minimum, a short description of the program, the availability of syndication funds, any required or suggested project, the place where application forms can be obtained and the deadline for submission of applications.

      (ii) Application forms. The agency or its designee shall prepare or cause to be prepared the forms upon which application are to be submitted, which forms may require such information as the agency deems to be necessary or desirable to effectuate the purposes of the program. Application forms shall be made available by the agency to all potential applicants.

      (iii) Amendments. The agency may change any aspect of the information set forth in the advertisement at any time. The agency shall amend the advertisement accordingly and shall place such amended advertisement in The City Record, the publications in which the original advertisement appeared, and such other publications as the agency shall deem appropriate. If it is infeasible for the agency to publish the amended advertisement in the publications in which the original advertisement appeared, the agency shall endeavor to provide substantially the same type of notice as was provided with respect to the original advertisement. The agency may also mail copies of such amended advertisement to potential applicants who have done prior business with the agency or who have requested to be on a mailing list for such purpose. Notwithstanding the foregoing, an application process may be terminated by the agency at any time without adver- tisement.

   (2) Submissions.

      (i) Time period. The agency may impose a deadline for submission of applications, which shall be a reasonable period of time after the advertisement first appears. The agency may, in the alternative, impose no deadline, in which case the agency shall receive, review, and approve or reject applications on a rolling basis as and when such applications are received.

      (ii) Completeness. The agency shall require applications to be submitted on the required forms and to be completed and executed in the manner set forth therein.

   (3) Selection.

      (i) Completeness. The application must include all required forms, and such forms must be fully and properly completed and executed, at the time of submission. The agency may reject an application if it determines that such requirements are not met.

      (ii) Selection. The agency may review and judge applications and select community groups by any method and upon any criteria permitted by law or these rules.

   (4) Limitations.

      (i) No obligation. The publication of an advertisement and the provision and acceptance of application forms shall not represent any obligation or agreement whatsoever on the part of the city or the agency, which may only be incurred or entered into by an EDA approved by the law department and duly executed by both parties. The city and the agency shall not be obligated to pay, nor shall they in fact pay, any costs or losses incurred by any applicant at any time, including, but not limited to, the cost of preparing an application.

      (ii) No warranty. The agency shall make no warranties, express or implied, with respect to any factual information contained in any advertisement.

   (5) Rights retained by agency. Where it is deemed by the agency to be in the best interests of the city:

      (i) The agency may terminate any application process in whole or in part at any time.

      (ii) The agency may reject any and all applications.

      (iii) The agency may at any time allow applicants to make modifications or additions to their applications.

      (iv) The agency may negotiate with applicants and may negotiate with parties which have not submitted applications.

      (v) The agency may negotiate on terms other than those set forth in the advertisement.

(e) RFP. Where the agency deems it to be feasible and desirable, a community group may be selected to receive syndication funds via an RFP. The RFP shall state that it is the type of selection process which the agency deems appropriate and shall describe the program, the availability of syndication funds, any required or suggested project(s), the selection process, and such other matters as the agency deems to be relevant. Where a potential community group has previously submitted a proposal and the agency has issued an RFP soliciting additional proposals to compete with such proposal, such RFP shall contain a copy or summary of such proposal and shall set forth in detail the standards by which the competition shall be judged.

   (1) Issuance. The agency may issue RFP's at any time it deems appropriate and desirable.

At such time as the agency issues an RFP for selection of one or more community groups, the agency shall place advertisements in The City Record and such other publications as the agency shall deem appropriate. The advertisement shall include, at a minimum, a short description of the program, the availability of syndication funds, any required or suggested project, the place a copy of the RFP can be obtained and the deadline for submission of proposals.

      (ii) Availability. A copy of the RFP shall be made available to all potential applicants prior to the submission deadline. The agency shall require all recipients of any RFP to furnish identification and shall cause a list of recipients to be maintained, which list shall in no event be furnished to any non-governmental party prior to the conclusion of the selection process.

      (iii) Amendments. The agency may issue written amendments to the RFP at any time prior to the submission deadline. The agency shall provide copies of such amendments to all recipients of the RFP.

   (3) Public Information.

      (i) Conference. Prior to the submission deadline, the agency may, but shall not be required to, hold an open conference where agency staff answer questions about submission and program requirements. The time and place for such conference, if any, shall be indicated in the RFP solicitation.

      (ii) Agency contacts. Agency staff shall be available during the submission period by telephone and/or in person to answer general questions about the RFP. The agency may require that contact with agency personnel by prospective applicants with respect to an RFP be limited to one or more person(s) designated in the RFP and/or that such contact be in writing.

   (4) Submissions.

      (i) Deadline. The deadline for submissions shall be a reasonable period of time after the advertisement first appears and shall be stated in the RFP.

      (ii) Completeness. The agency shall require proposals to be submitted in the format and number prescribed in the RFP and to contain all information and forms required therein.

         (A) Completeness. The proposal must include all required forms, and such forms must be fully and properly completed and executed, at the time of submission.

         (B) Compliance. The proposal must comply in all respects with all material terms of the RFP.

      (ii) Threshold criteria. The agency may impose such additional threshold criteria in the RFP as it deems necessary or desirable. Provided that a proposal has passed all basic requirements, the agency shall consider such threshold criteria as are established in the RFP. Such threshold criteria may include, but shall not be limited to, those characteristics of applicants which have a bearing on their ability to successfully complete the project (e.g., organizational capacity, comparable experience, financial capacity, and current and projected workload), those characteristics of the applicant's proposal which have a bearing on the performance of the project, and any other factors which the agency deems appropriate.

      (iii) Competitive criteria. The agency may impose such additional competitive criteria in the RFP as it deems necessary or desirable. Provided that a proposal has passed all threshold criteria, the agency shall consider such competitive criteria as are established in the RFP. Such criteria may include, but shall not be limited to, those characteristics of applicants which have a bearing on their ability to successfully complete the project (e.g., organizational capacity, comparable experience, and current and expected workload), those characteristics of the applicant's proposal which have a bearing on the performance of the project, and any other factors which the agency deems appropriate.

   (6) Limitations.

      (i) No obligation. An RFP shall not represent any obligation or agreement whatsoever on the part of the city or the agency, which may only be incurred or entered into by written EDA approved as to form by the city's law department and duly executed by both parties. The city and the agency shall not be obligated to pay, nor shall they in fact pay, any costs or losses incurred by any applicant at any time, including, but not limited to, the cost of responding to the RFP.

      (ii) No warranty. The agency shall make no warranties, express or implied, with respect to any factual information contained in any RFP.

The agency may select an applicant to be a community group without any agency selection process where such applicant has already been selected or designated by (i) another agency or instrumentality of the city, (ii) any agency or instrumentality of the state or federal government, (iii) any public authority, public benefit corporation, or other quasi-governmental entity, (iv) a developer pursuant to an agreement, or (v) any other entity designated by the agency to perform such selection. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the preceding sentence or elsewhere in these rules, the agency shall only select a community group pursuant to this 28 RCNY § 28-03(f) where the agency deems such method of selection to be necessary or desirable, and the agency shall not be required to select any applicant solely because such applicant has been selected by any other entity.

(g) Non-agency process. The agency may select a community group by a process not set forth in these rules where funding for the project is provided by, and/or the alternative selection process is mandated by, either (i) another agency or instrumentality of the city, (ii) any agency or instrumentality of the state or federal government, (iii) any public authority, public benefit corporation, or other quasi-governmental entity, (iv) a developer pursuant to an agreement, or (v) any other entity designated by the agency to perform such selection.

*§ 28-04 Conditional Designation of Community Groups.* ::


(a) Rejection letters. The agency shall notify all unsuccessful applicants in writing. Such letter shall state the reasons for the rejection of such applicant's proposal or other submission.

(b) Conditional designation. The agency shall notify all successful applicants of their conditional designation as community groups. Such notification may be, but shall not be required to be, in writing and may be in any form which the agency deems to be appropriate, including, but not limited to, a conditional designation letter. Such letter, if any, shall be signed by the commissioner and shall constitute the selection and conditional designation of the applicant, subject to satisfaction of all conditions stated in the letter or in these rules or imposed by the agency or by applicable law. The letter may include, but shall not be limited to, the following matters:

   (1) Acceptance deadline. The letter may require the applicant to unconditionally accept the designation within a time period for acceptance established therein.

   (2) Program requirements. The letter may set forth program requirements and conditions upon which the designation was made and may state that any non-conformance or change in any of such requirements may be deemed by the agency to constitute a default.

   (3) Schedule. The letter may contain a schedule of activities which must be completed as pre-conditions for the actions to be taken in connection with the disbursement of syndication funds.

(c) No liability. Conditional designation shall mean only that the agency intends to negotiate with the community group concerning a project and EDA until such conditional designation is terminated, a requirement of the agency or the city is not satisfied, or an EDA is executed. Conditional designation is not a contract or agreement and shall not create any rights on the community group's part, including, without limitation, rights of enforcement, equity, or reimbursement. No such contract or agreement shall exist, and no such rights shall be created, until the city and the community group enter into a written EDA approved as to form by the law department and duly executed by both parties.

(d) Termination of conditional designation. 

   (1) Causes for termination. After conditional designation of a community group, the agency may terminate such conditional designation at any time if the agency determines that the city should not enter into an EDA with the community group for any reason, including, but not limited to, the following:

      (i) Failure to comply with terms of designation. The community group has failed to comply with any term or condition of the conditional designation letter.

      (ii) Failure to meet city requirements. The community group has either (A) failed to clear one or more of the required city reviews, including, but not limited to, IG clearance and EO clearance, or (B) failed to satisfy other requirements established by the agency or the city.

      (iii) Lack of resources. The community group lacks the necessary expertise, administrative or other resources, or legal capacity to perform the project.

      (iv) Lack of funding. Adequate funding for the entire project, whether from syndication funds, other city funds, or any other public or private source, is not available or is not provided in a timely manner.

      (v) Best interests of city. The agency or the city has not approved the required actions for any reason determined by the agency or the city to be in the best interests of the city.

   (2) Notice of termination. If the agency elects to terminate the conditional designation of a community group, the agency shall notify the community group of such termination in writing.

   (3) Right to comment. The agency shall give any terminated community group an opportunity to comment on the reasons for such termination, either in writing or by a conference with a responsible official of the agency. The agency shall give due consideration to any comments made by such community group, but shall retain the sole discretion whether to revoke the termination, set specific conditions for a revocation of the termination, or retain the termination. If the agency decides to revoke or conditionally revoke the termination, the agency shall notify the community group of its decision in writing. Nothing in this 28 RCNY § 28-04(d)(3) or this 28 RCNY § 28-04 shall be deemed to restrict the power and authority of the agency to negotiate with other parties, to enter into EDA's, or to take such other actions with respect to the syndication funds as the agency shall determine to be necessary or desirable, prior to receipt of comments from a terminated community group.






*§ 28-05 Projects.* ::


(a) EDA. The agency shall negotiate with each conditionally designated community group concerning the terms of the EDA pursuant to which such community group will perform one or more projects. Such negotiation shall continue until either the community group's conditional designation is terminated pursuant to these rules or an EDA is executed by the city and the community group. The city and the agency shall not disburse any syndication funds from the escrow account to the community group for any project until the city and the community group have executed an EDA in form approved by the law department and in form and substance acceptable to the agency. Each disbursement of syndication funds from the escrow account to a community group for a project shall be made in accordance with such EDA. The agency shall not be obligated to disburse any funds pursuant to an EDA beyond those syndication funds received from the developer of the applicable development.

(b) Scope of work. Each EDA shall include a scope of work describing the project in form and substance satisfactory to the agency. Such scope of work shall include, without limitation, a detailed description of the eligible activities to be performed with the syndication funds, and timetables for commencement, progress, and completion of the project.

(c) Eligible activities. The eligible activities to be included in the scope of work of any EDA may include, but shall not be limited to, the following:

      (i) salaries for staff who provide services which are particular to the project,

      (ii) consultant fees,

      (iii) office supplies,

      (iv) rent,

      (v) insurance,

      (vi) other costs directly related to the performance of the project.

   (3) Other approved use. The agency may approve any other use of syndication funds which is consistent with these rules, even though such use is not listed in 28 RCNY § 28-05(c)(1) or (c)(2).

If the agency concludes that further consideration is not required, the agency shall either (i) approve the proposed EDA, (ii) approve the proposed EDA with modifications, or (iii) disapprove the proposed EDA. If the agency approves the proposed EDA, the agency may, but shall not be required to, proceed with the execution of the EDA. If the agency approves the proposed EDA with modifications, the agency may, but shall not be required to, proceed with the execution of the modified EDA, and no additional public comment procedure shall be required concerning such modifications. If the agency disapproves the proposed EDA, the agency shall thereafter either (i) resume negotiations with the community group on a new or modified EDA, or (ii) terminate the conditional designation of the community group.

(c) Public hearing. If the agency determines, based upon the written comments received by it, that further consideration of the proposed action(s) is required, the agency shall convene a public hearing in accordance with this 28 RCNY § 28-06(c).

   (1) Notice to public. The agency shall place an advertisement in The City Record and such other publications as the agency shall deem appropriate, which advertisement shall include, at a minimum, (i) a description of the program, (ii) a description of the proposed project, (iii) the designated community group(s) or other proposed recipient of the syndication funds, (iv) where and when the public may inspect the proposed EDA, and (v) the date, time, and location at which members of the public may comment in person on any action described in the advertisement and/or EDA. The agency shall endeavor to mail copies of such advertisement to (i) the borough president in the borough in which the project is located, (ii) the community board in the community district in which the project is located, (iii) such other public officials or agencies as the agency shall deem appropriate, and (iv) if feasible, all parties who submitted written comments pursuant to 28 RCNY § 28-06(b).

   (2) Conduct of public hearing. A representative of the agency shall commence the public hearing by describing the action proposed by the agency. The agency shall then afford all persons attending who desire to comment upon such action a reasonable opportunity to speak; provided, however, that the agency may establish and enforce a uniform time limit upon the comments of all speakers; provided further, however, that such time limit shall in no event be less than two (2) minutes per speaker. An audio tape or transcript shall be made of the proceedings and a record shall be made of persons in attendance at the hearing.

   (3) Review of public comments. After the public hearing, the agency shall review the comments of the speakers and shall determine whether to (i) approve the proposed EDA, (ii) approve the proposed EDA with modifications, or (iii) disapprove the proposed EDA. If the agency approves the proposed EDA, the agency may, but shall not be required to, proceed with the execution of the EDA. If the agency approves the proposed EDA with modifications, the agency may, but shall not be required to, proceed with the execution of the modified EDA, and no additional public comment procedure shall be required concerning such modifications. If the agency disapproves the proposed EDA, the agency shall thereafter either (i) resume negotiations with the community group on a new or modified EDA, or (ii) terminate the conditional designation of the community group.

(d) Unencumbered funds. The agency may disburse unencumbered funds in any manner permitted by law and these rules, including, without limitation, the following methods:

   (1) New community group. The agency may select a new community group and make disbursements to it in accordance with these rules;

   (2) Agency project. The agency may prepare a scope of work and EDA for a project and/or disburse unencumbered funds for the performance of such project to the agency rather than to a community group;

   (3) Tax levy. The agency may apply unencumbered funds toward the cost of providing city services in the borough of the development which generated such syndication funds; and

   (4) Best interests of the city. The agency may utilize unencumbered funds in any other manner deemed by the agency to be in the best interests of the city, including, but not limited to, disbursement of such unencumbered funds into the general fund of the city.

(e) Non-escrowed syndication funds. Where developers and community groups entered into agreements which provided for the payment of syndication funds directly from the developers to the community groups, the agency shall seek to enforce these rules to the extent practicable. Where the respective agreements provide the agency with sufficient authority to do so, the agency may (1) order developers to thereafter make all payments of syndication funds to the city rather than directly to community groups, and (2) order community groups to surrender all syndication funds in their possession to the city. Any syndication funds so obtained or recovered shall be deposited into the escrow account and made subject to the requirements of these rules.






*§ 28-07 Project Administration.* ::


(a) Accounts established by community groups. The community group shall establish a separate checking or savings account and shall submit a banking resolution to the agency which shall provide that (1) the commissioner shall be authorized to stop all disbursements from each such account or seize all funds therein, in the event of any failure to comply with the applicable EDA or agreement, or for any other reason deemed necessary or desirable by the agency to protect the best interests of the city consistent with these rules and applicable laws, and (2) checks or drafts shall be signed by at least two officers or designated, authorized signatories of the community group before a check or draft may be negotiated or funds withdrawn. Any syndication funds received by a community group, whether from the escrow account pursuant to an EDA or directly from a developer pursuant to an agreement, or monies repaid to the community group from any project activities, shall be deposited into such account and shall be held and utilized strictly in accordance with these rules. No syndication funds shall be disbursed to the community group and no funds shall be disbursed by the community group from such account until and unless the agency shall approve such banking resolution in writing.

(b) Reporting requirements and audits.

   (1) Reports. At the end of the first six-month period after a community group receives its first disbursement, and every six months thereafter for as long as syndication funds remain in use by the community group, it shall provide the agency with a report and interim financial statement summarizing the use of the syndication funds received by it, together with copies of all bank statements and cancelled checks, and with a reconciliation of the checking and/or savings account.

   (2) Audits. Starting with the end of the first full calendar year in which syndication funds were available to the community group for six months or longer, (i) the community group shall provide yearly audited financial statements to the agency, and (ii) all of the books and records of the community group shall be subject to review and audit by the agency or the comptroller. The community group shall maintain such books and records and shall make them available for audit for a period of six (6) years after the expiration of its EDA. Any agreements between a community group and its contractors shall contain substantially the same language as contained in this 28 RCNY § 28-07(b)(2). The community group shall require the certified public accountant retained by it to prepare its audited financial statement to (i) make its "work papers" available upon demand to the agency or the comptroller, and (ii) register with the comptroller upon demand by the city.

(c) EDA defaults. In the event that a community group defaults on its obligations pursuant to an EDA, the agency may terminate such EDA and/or invoke any other remedy available to the city pursuant to the EDA, these rules, or applicable laws.






*§ 28-08 Miscellaneous Provisions.* ::


(a) Adverse findings. Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary in these rules or in any document concerning any selection process, any project, or the program, the agency may reject any applicant or terminate any conditional designation of a community group if the agency determines at any time that good and sufficient reasons exist why the city should not do business with such party or should not allow such party to act as community group for the particular project in question. Such reasons shall include, but shall not be limited to, evidence with respect to the applicant or any member of its development team or any contractor retained by such applicant or any of its principals of:

   (1) Arson conviction or pending cases,

   (2) Harassment conviction or pending cases,

   (3) Arrears or default upon any debt, lease, contract, tax, lien, fee, charge, or obligation to the city,

   (4) City mortgage or tax foreclosure proceedings or arrears,

   (5) Unsuccessful record with comparable projects, including, but not limited to, poor workmanship, failure to complete a project expeditiously, building violations or litigation history against other properties, or unsuccessful record of managing residential real property,

   (6) Inability, due to lack of organizational capacity, competing demands from other projects, or any other factor to perform all work required to successfully complete the project,

   (7) Bankruptcy or insolvency,

   (8) Violation of the conflict of interest provisions of the city charter or any other applicable laws, or

   (9) Failure to obtain IG clearance and/or EO clearance.

(b) Agency discretion. All determinations to be made by the agency and/or the commissioner in accordance with these rules shall be in the sole discretion of the agency and/or the commissioner; provided, however, that the agency and/or the commissioner shall comply in all respects with applicable laws.

(c) Statutory authority not limited. Nothing in these rules shall be deemed to prevent the agency from exercising such greater or additional rights, remedies, privileges, powers, and authority as shall be provided by law.

(d) Rights not conferred. These rules are not intended to confer rights or benefits upon the general public or upon any individual, entity, or actual or potential community group. Nothing in these rules shall be deemed to confer any rights or benefits whatsoever upon any party which are in addition to any rights deriving from applicable laws or written contracts with the agency.

(e) No legal obligation. At any time prior to the execution of a legally binding written EDA by the agency and the community group, the agency may withdraw its approval of all or any portion of a project, change the contemplated actions and project, change the community group selection process for a project, terminate the designation of a community group, select a new community group, or take any other action deemed by the agency to be necessary or appropriate. A selection process shall not represent any obligation or agreement whatsoever on the part of the city or the agency, which may only be incurred or entered into by written EDA approved as to form by the law department and duly executed by both parties. The city and the agency shall not be obligated to pay, nor shall they in fact pay, any costs or losses incurred by any applicant at any time, including, but not limited to, the cost of applying for selection as a community group. Conditional designation of a community group shall mean only that the agency intends to negotiate with such community group concerning one or more potential projects until either an EDA is executed or such conditional designation is terminated. Conditional designation of an applicant is not a contract or agreement and shall not create any rights on the applicant's part, including, without limitation, rights of enforcement, equity or reimbursement. No such contract or agreement shall exist, and no such rights shall be created, until the city and the community group enter into an EDA approved as to form by the law department and duly executed by both parties. Approval of a project and/or EDA by any party pursuant to these rules shall not obligate the agency to proceed with the project or with the execution of such EDA.

(f) Technical violations.

*§ 33-02 Site Selection.* ::


(a)  General. This Article sets forth procedures for the selection of Sites for Projects. Such determinations shall be made by the Agency, in accordance with the procedures set forth herein, for the purposes of ascertaining whether a Site meets the requirements of a Project and applicable Laws, achieving the City Housing Goals, and protecting and furthering the best interests of the City.

(b) Determination of Appropriateness. The Agency may determine to place any Site into any Project where the Agency determines, for any reason, that such Project is an appropriate treatment for such Site. Such reasons, may include, but shall not be limited to, the following:

   (1) The physical conditions or economic characteristics of the Site make it appropriate for the treatment afforded by the Project.

   (2) The Site requires more private investment and/or less Assistance than would be provided under any other appropriate Project or Program, and the Project permits the treatment of the Site with such level of private investment or Assistance.

   (3) The Site requires less private investment and/or more Assistance than would be provided under any other appropriate Project or Program, and the Project permits the treatment of the Site with such level of private investment or Assistance.

   (4) The Site possesses unique features which make the treatment afforded by the Project necessary or desirable.

   (5) The Project addresses a housing need which has not been and is not likely to be fully alleviated by the operations of the private housing market, and the Site is appropriate for inclusion in the Project.

   (6) The Project would return the Site to private ownership and/or private management.

   (7) The interest of one or more private parties in the Site creates special opportunities to develop the Site in unique and beneficial ways, including, but not limited to, ways which provide housing for persons with special needs, maximize City revenue, permit development with less Assistance than would be required if the Site were in another Project or Program, permit production of a greater number of units or a greater proportion of lower income units than would be produced if the Site were in another Project or Program, and/or permit development of more ancillary open space or other public facilities.

   (8) The Site is not City-owned and the owner, or an authorized representative of the owner, has applied to the Agency, pursuant to any process authorized by these Rules, other rules of the Agency, or applicable Law, to have the Site included in a Project which would serve the City Housing Goals.

   (9) The inclusion of the Site in the Project would serve any of the City Housing Goals.

(c) Selection. Upon the selection of a Site for a Project, the Agency may, but shall not be required to, prepare a written statement identifying the Site and the Project. Such Site selection document may be in any form which the Agency deems appropriate, including, but not limited to, a letter or memorandum placed in the file for the Project, an Authorization Letter, entry into a book, file, database, or other record of Agency Site Selections, any document prepared in order to comply with applicable Laws (including, but not limited to, the Uniform Land Use Review Procedure, the Urban Renewal Law, and the Urban Development Action Area Act), a document issued as part of any process to select a Sponsor (including, but not limited to, any RFQ, RFP, or bid solicitation), or a Loan commitment letter. Failure to prepare a Site selection document shall not invalidate the selection of a Site for a Project.

(d) Revocation. The Agency may revoke a Site selection where the Agency deems such revocation to be necessary or desirable. Upon the revocation of a Site selection, the Agency may, but shall not be required to, prepare a written statement identifying the Site and the Project from which the Site has been removed. Such Site selection revocation document, if any, may be in any of the forms permitted for a Site selection document. Failure to prepare a Site selection revocation document writing shall not invalidate the revocation, and any subsequent selection of a Site for a different Project shall serve to automatically terminate the prior Site selection. After revocation of any Site selection, the Agency may select the Site for any other Project in accordance with these Rules.

*§ 41-19 Grandfathered Tenants in Homeownership Affordable Housing.* ::


A rental Building that qualifies for Preservation Homeownership Affordable Housing or Substantial Rehabilitation Homeownership Affordable Housing may convert to Homeownership Affordable Housing. Upon conversion to Homeownership Affordable Housing, tenants in legal occupancy in such a Building who do not wish to purchase a Homeownership Affordable Housing Unit will be treated the same as Grandfathered Tenants in rental Affordable Housing. Such Grandfathered Tenants will also retain the right to purchase their Dwelling Unit. When a Grandfathered Tenant chooses to vacate a Homeownership Affordable Housing Unit, such unit must be sold to an Eligible Buyer.






*§ 41-20 Renters In New Construction Homeownership Affordable Housing.* ::


New Construction Homeownership Affordable Housing Units that are not purchased by Eligible Buyers may be rented in accordance with the rental provisions of the Program on or after the date of issuance of a Completion Notice for New Construction Affordable Housing containing such unit.

*§ 41-22 HPD Approval.* ::


Wherever the Zoning Resolution states that HPD's approval is required, such approval must be in writing and signed by the Commissioner.

(d) Payment of any fees under this section shall be made by a certified or bank check or money order payable to the Department of Finance of the City of New York.








*§ 41-24 [Affordable Housing Fund Contribution.]* ::


(a) General Provisions For the Payment of the Affordable Housing Fund Contribution.

   (1) Prior to the issuance of a Permit Notice for an MIH Development that is eligible and elects to make a contribution to the Affordable Housing Fund, the following must occur:

      (A) Approval of such MIH Development’s MIH Application by HPD.

      (B) Recordation against the MIH Zoning Lot of a restrictive declaration setting forth the amount of the Affordable Housing Fund contribution and the amount of residential floor area to be constructed at the MIH Development. Such restrictive declaration must be approved in form and in substance by HPD.

      (C) Payment to HPD of the full amount of the MIH Development’s contribution to the Affordable Housing Fund by a certified check or bank check payable to the New York City Housing Development Corporation.

   (2) The Affordable Housing Fund contribution shall be held by HDC or such other depositary as HPD designates.

(b) Methodology For Determining the Affordable Housing Fund Contribution. The amount of the Affordable Housing Fund contribution as listed in the table below is based upon the cost of providing Affordable Floor Area in the community district in which the eligible MIH Development is located. This amount varies by community district to approximate the cost differentials in providing Affordable Floor Area throughout the City of New York, as well as to satisfy the requirements of Zoning Resolution § 23-154(d)(3)(v). HPD uses Department of Finance sales data (“DOF Data”) for residential condominium units and, where necessary, for one- to four-unit residential buildings to group together community districts with similar market characteristics (“Fee Tiers”). Each Fee Tier is associated with a different Affordable Housing Fund contribution amount.

   (1) Determining Contribution Per Square Foot. The amount of the Affordable Housing Fund contribution per square foot for each Fee Tier is determined by calculating the difference between the Market Price and the Affordable Price for each Fee Tier. However, HPD shall establish a minimum Affordable Housing Fund contribution amount per square foot based on the approximate maximum per square foot subsidy that HPD and HDC would contribute to newly constructed affordable housing under an affordable housing program serving predominantly low-income households.

   (2) Calculating Market Price. Market Price is an approximation of the market price per square foot for a residential development, enlargement or conversion. A Market Price is calculated for each Fee Tier using DOF Data for that Fee Tier. The Market Price for a Fee Tier is equal to the fortieth percentile sales price per square foot for units that are in developments meeting the unit count and maximum square footage eligibility criteria for the Affordable Housing Fund option.

   (3) Calculating Affordable Price. Affordable Price is an approximation of the price per square foot of affordable residential floor area. One Affordable Price serves all Fee Tiers. The Affordable Price is equal to the price calculated to be affordable to the mean of the maximum weighted averages of Income Bands associated with each of the options set forth in Zoning Resolution §§ 23-154(d)(3)(i)-(ii) divided by the median size of units in the DOF Data used to determine Market Prices.

(c) Required Amount of Contribution to Affordable Housing Fund.

   (1) The Affordable Housing Fund contribution made by an MIH Development equals the mean amount of Affordable Floor Area such MIH Development would have otherwise been required to provide under Zoning Resolution §§ 23-154(d)(3)(i)-(ii) multiplied by the applicable amount of contribution per square foot in effect at the time the MIH Application is submitted to HPD for the community district in which the MIH Development is located. The Affordable Housing Fund contribution per square foot of Affordable Floor Area for each community district is as follows:
