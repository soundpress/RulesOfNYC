In accordance with this provision, the percentages set forth in § 5-18(b) of these rules shall be applicable to the calculations of special rebates for all eligible energy users, eligible owners, and qualified eligible energy users that applied for ECSP benefits prior to November 1, 2000. These percentages shall be in place from the first billing cycle beginning on or after April 30, 2003.

(b) For all billing cycles prior to the ninety-seventh month of each of the above-noted eligible energy user's, eligible owner's and qualified eligible energy user's benefit period occurring during the period beginning on or after April 30, 2003, each such user shall receive rebates on eligible charges as specified in this paragraph; provided that the applicable rebate percentages shall not, for any affected electric or natural gas account, exceed 100% of the eligible charges or eligible public utility service charges charged in any billing cycle.

   (1) The rebate percentage to be applied to eligible charges for electrical-related energy services provided by Con Edison pursuant to its "PSC No. 9 – Electricity Rate Schedule" or "PSC No. 2 – Retail Access Rate Schedule" shall equal the percentages specified in Attachment A of Appendix A to these rules, which shall vary depending on such user's average monthly load factor, applicable service classification and the applicable rate, and whether such user receives discounts on service pursuant to a service rider. If, for any affected user, eligible charges for electrical-related energy services were rendered at more than one service classification and/or at more than one rate for a service classification, the rebate percentages specified in Attachment A of Appendix A to these rules shall apply to the extent that each applicable service classification and/or rate and/or service rider applies to such user. To the extent that any user is served under Con Edison's "PSC No. 9 – Electricity Rate Schedule" its rebate percentages shall be determined as if such user were served under Con Edison's PSC No. 2 – Retail Access Rate Schedule.

   (2) The rebate percentage to be applied to eligible charges for natural gas-related energy services provided by Con Edison pursuant to its "PSC No. 9 – Gas Rate Schedule" shall equal the percentages specified in Attachment C of Appendix A to these rules, which shall vary depending on such user's average monthly consumption, applicable service classification and the applicable rate, and whether such user receives discounts on energy services rates pursuant to a service rider or other tariff provision. If, for any affected user, eligible charges for natural gas-related energy services were rendered at more than one service classification and/or at more than one rate for a service classification or if discounted service was provided to part of the consumption rendered through an account pursuant to a service rider or tariff provision, the rebate percentages specified in Attachment C of Appendix A to these rules shall apply to the extent that each applicable service classification and/or rate and/or service rider applies to such user. To the extent that such user is served under "PSC No. 9 – Gas Rate Schedule," its rebate percentages shall be determined as if such user were served under the corresponding full-service rate and service classification and rate.

*§ 5-66 Special Rebates for Redistributors and Users that Applied for LMEP Benefits Prior to November 1, 2000 and Were Certified Prior to July 1, 2001. [Repealed]* ::


(a)  Paragraph (1) of subdivision (a) of § 25-bb of the general city law states that the "that the department of business services of a city having a population of one million or more may increase the percentages set forth in § 5-65 of these rules at its discretion in order to maintain the special rebate at levels comparable to those historically provided under the program, pursuant to rules that are generally applicable to distinct classes of energy users." In accordance with this provision, the percentages set forth in this section of the rules shall be applicable to the calculations of special rebates for all eligible redistributors of energy or directly metered eligible revitalization energy users that applied for LMEP benefits prior to November 1, 2000 and for qualified eligible energy redistributors of energy that were certified before November 1, 2000. These percentages shall be in place from the first billing cycle beginning on or after April 30, 2003.

(b) Except as set forth in subdivision (d) of this section, for all billing cycles prior to the ninety-seventh month of each eligible redistributor of energy's or directly metered eligible revitalization energy user's benefit period occurring during the period beginning June 1, 2001, each redistributor or user shall receive rebates on eligible charges as specified in this paragraph; provided that the applicable rebate percentages shall not, for any affected electric account, exceed 100% of the eligible charges charged in any billing cycle.

   (1) The rebate percentage to be applied to eligible charges for energy services provided by a utility pursuant to its "PSC No. 9 – Electricity Rate Schedule" or "PSC No. 2 – Retail Access Rate Schedule" shall equal the percentages specified in Attachment A of Appendix A of these rules, which shall vary depending on such redistributor's or user's average monthly load factor, applicable service classification and the applicable rate, and whether such redistributor or user receives discounts on service pursuant to a service rider. If, for any affected redistributor or user, eligible charges for energy services were rendered at more than one service classification and/or at more than one rate for a service classification, the rebate percentages specified in Attachment A of Appendix A of these rules shall apply to the extent that each applicable service classification and/or rate and/or service rider applies to such redistributor or user. To the extent that such redistributor or user is served under the utility's "PSC No. 9 – Electrical Rate Schedule" its rebate percentages shall be determined as if such redistributor or user was served under the utility's "PSC No. 2 – Retail Access Rate Schedule."

   (2) The rebate percentage to be applied to eligible public utility service charges for energy services provided by NYCPUS pursuant to its "Service Tariff No. 4 Rate Schedule" shall equal the percentages specified in Attachment B of Appendix A of these rules, which shall vary depending on such redistributor's or user's average monthly load factor, the applicable service classification and the applicable rate, and whether such redistributor or user receives discounts on service pursuant to a service rider or other tariff provisions. If, for any affected redistributor or user, eligible public utility service charges for energy services were rendered at more than one service classification and/or at more than one rate for a service classification or if discounted service was provided to part of the consumption rendered through an account pursuant to a service rider or tariff provision, the rebate percentages specified in Attachment B of Appendix A of these rules shall apply to the extent that each applicable service classification and/or rate and/or service rider or other tariff discount applies to such redistributor or user.

(c) Except as otherwise provided in subdivision (d) of this section, for all billing cycles after the ninety-sixth month of the benefit period and thereafter, the applicable rebate percentages on eligible charges, determined as specified in § 5-67(b) or (e) of these rules, shall be multiplied by an adjustment factor, depending on the month of the benefit period in which the energy services were rendered; provided that the applicable rebate percentages shall not, for any affected eligible redistributor of energy or directly metered eligible revitalization energy user, exceed 100% of the eligible charges charged in any billing cycle.

**Subchapter C: Implementation**



*§ 5-71 Implementation by Eligible Redistributor of Energy or Qualified Eligible Redistributor of Energy.* ::


(a)  An eligible redistributor of energy or qualified eligible redistributor of energy shall reduce the energy services bills rendered to eligible revitalization area energy users that are not directly metered and that occupy, operate or manage premises in eligible buildings owned or leased by such redistributor by an amount equal, in the aggregate, to one hundred percent (100%) of each special rebate received by such redistributor.

(b) An eligible redistributor of energy or qualified eligible redistributor of energy shall individually and accurately meter or submeter the energy services sold or otherwise redistributed by such redistributor to each such eligible revitalization area energy user or other occupant of eligible buildings so as to enable a determination of each such user's or occupant's usage of energy services, provided such user or occupant occupies, operates or manages premises that equal or exceed the lesser of ten thousand (10,000) contiguous square feet in area or the entire floor of a building.

(c) In order to establish the usage of energy services attributable to the tenants occupying an eligible building, an eligible redistributor of energy or qualified eligible redistributor of energy shall have a load study performed by a licensed professional engineer on all non-eligible users that are not individually metered or submetered. In addition, such redistributor shall have all of the submeters attributable to non-eligible users read by a licensed professional engineer.

(d) If an eligible redistributor of energy or qualified eligible redistributor of energy charges amounts to eligible revitalization area energy users and other users that vary annually or more frequently with the costs incurred by such redistributor for the operation of common areas, systems and facilities, such redistributor shall reduce such charges by the portion of the special rebates attributable thereto.

(e) An eligible redistributor of energy or qualified eligible redistributor of energy shall allocate the reductions required by subdivision (a) of this § 5-71 in direct proportion to each such eligible revitalization area energy user's use of energy services. Such reductions shall be determined as follows:

   (1) The total amount of such redistributor's energy services bill shall be divided by the total amount of kilowatt hours used by the eligible building to determine the cost per kilowatt hour charge for the eligible building;

   (2) If the premises of such eligible revitalization area energy user or other user are submetered, such reduction shall be established by multiplying: (A) the amount of energy services use determined by such submeter; by (B) the dollar per kilowatt charge determined in (1) above; by (C) the amount of the special rebate set forth in § 5-65 or § 5-67 of these rules;

   (3) If two or more eligible revitalization area energy users or other users share a submeter, the amount of the reduction to be shared by the eligible revitalization area energy users shall be determined in accordance with (2) above. This amount shall then be allocated among such users in direct proportion to the floor area of the premises occupied, operated or managed by each such user;

   (4) If the premises of such eligible revitalization area energy user is not required to be submetered by these rules, such discount shall be determined as follows:

(A) Divide the portion of the special rebate received by all submetered eligible revitalization area energy users by their total square footage to determine the special rebate per square footage amount; and

(B) Multiply the special rebate per square footage amount determined in (A) above by the square footage of each non-submetered eligible revitalization area energy user to determine the amount of the special rebate each such non-submetered eligible revitalization area energy user is entitled to;

   (5) The special rebate to be applied to common areas, systems and facilities shall be the total rebate received by the eligible building less: (A) the total special rebate received by each submetered eligible revitalization area energy user as determined in (2) above; and (B) the total special rebate received by each submetered eligible revitalization area energy user sharing a submeter as determined in (3) above; and (C) the total special rebate received by all non-submetered eligible revitalization area energy users as determined in (4) above.

(f) If the premises of an eligible revitalization area energy user are directly metered, such discount shall be determined by such meter.

(g) An eligible redistributor of energy or qualified eligible redistributor of energy shall limit charges to those eligible revitalization area energy users that are submetered in accordance with this section to a price for the purchase of energy services that shall be no higher than the price paid by such redistributor, provided that an additional fee, not exceeding twelve percent (12%) of such sales price, may be charged by such redistributor for energy services sold to such eligible revitalization area energy users.

(h) An eligible redistributor of energy or a qualified eligible redistributor of energy shall separately state in all energy bills rendered by such redistributor to an eligible revitalization area energy user for sales of energy services the amount of the reduction in charges for such services representing the share of the special rebate allocated to such user, or that no reduction has been made, and shall state the following: "You may be entitled to share a rebate which your landlord has received for charges for energy services pursuant to the revitalization area energy rebate program. The amount is separately stated and identified in this bill." Any deviation from this language must be approved in advance by DBS.

(i) An eligible redistributor of energy or qualified eligible redistributor of energy shall keep records verifying compliance with the requirements of LMEP, and allow DBS access to such records.

(j) An eligible redistributor of energy or qualified eligible redistributor of energy shall provide access to eligible buildings or targeted eligible buildings to DBS for the purpose of inspecting meters, submeters and other equipment and verifying the accuracy of any application or supplement thereto filed with DBS and DOF.






*§ 5-72 Implementation by a Utility and NYCPUS.* ::


(a)  Where a utility or NYCPUS is required to make a special rebate pursuant to § 5-65 or § 5-67 of these rules, they shall reduce each energy services bill for each eligible redistributor of energy or qualified eligible redistributor of energy or directly metered eligible revitalization area energy user by the full amount of the special rebate that shall have accrued for the period covered by each such energy services bill. A utility or NYCPUS shall cease to make such reductions in such energy services bills upon receipt of notification from DBS that the certification of eligibility has been suspended or terminated, and a utility or NYCPUS shall change the amount of such reduction in accordance with notification from DBS.

(b) A utility shall not be required to make a special rebate to such eligible redistributor of energy or qualified eligible redistributor of energy in excess of the charges for energy services.






*§ 5-73 Granting of Utility Credit to a Utility.* ::


(a)  Where a utility has granted special rebates to recipients in accordance with the provisions set forth in § 5-65 or § 5-67 of these rules, it shall be entitled to a utility credit equal to the aggregate amount of all such special rebates it has provided to recipients.

(b) Such utility credit may be taken only as provided for in the code, these rules and rules promulgated by the commissioner of DOF, for the purpose of permitting utilities a deduction against certain taxes.

After a hearing held pursuant to the rules of the Division, the Director may direct the imposition by the contracting agency head of any or all of the following sanctions:

      (i) disapproval of the contractor;

      (ii) suspension or termination of the contract;

      (iii) declaring the contractor in default; or

      (iv) in lieu of any of the foregoing sanctions, the Director may impose an employment program. The Director of the Division may recommend to the contracting agency head that a contractor who has repeatedly failed to comply with E.O. 50 (§ 10-14) and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder be determined to be nonresponsible. The contractor agrees to include the provisions of the foregoing paragraphs in every subcontract or purchase order in excess of the small purchase limit established by rule of the Procurement Policy Board to which it becomes a party unless exempted by E.O. 50 (§ 10-14) and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, so that such provisions will be binding upon each subcontractor or vendor. The contractor will take such action with respect to any subcontract or purchase order as may be directed by the Director of the Division of Labor Services as a means of enforcing such provisions including sanctions for noncompliance. The contractor further agrees that it will refrain from entering into any contract or contract modification subject to E.O. 50 (§ 10-14) and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder with a subcontractor who is not in compliance with the requirements of E.O. 50 (§ 10-14) and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder."

(b) Special provisions for construction contracts. In addition to the contractual provisions required in § l0-04(a), each contracting agency shall incorporate into every contract for a construction project in excess of $125,000 to which it becomes a party the following language: "The contractor further agrees that it shall employ trainees for training level jobs and it shall participate in on-the-job training programs other than apprenticeship programs which are approved by the Division and where required by law, the U.S. Department of Labor, Bureau of Apprenticeship Training or the New York State Department of Labor. The contractor shall make a good faith effort to achieve the ratio of one (1) trainee to four (4) journey-level employees of each trade on each construction project; provided, that the trainee requirement shall not apply to contracts in the amount of $125,000 or less. "Trainee" means an economically disadvantaged person who qualifies for and receives training in one of the construction trades pursuant to a program, other than an apprenticeship program, approved by the Division and, where required by law, the New York State Department of Labor and the United States Department of Labor, Bureau of Apprenticeship and Training. The contractor shall be considered to employ 4 journey-level employees in a particular trade when he or she employs any number of journey-level employees in that craft whose aggregate work hours equal the number of hours 4 full-time journey-level employees would have worked in a work week as defined by the prevailing practice in the industry for the particular craft, i.e., 40 hours, 37 1/2 hours, 35 hours, etc. For example, in a craft where there is a forty-hour work week, the employment of 4 journey-level employees results in 160 hours of employment (4 × 40). Hence, any number of journey-level employees which results in 160 hours of work is considered for purposes of the training program to equal 4 journey-level employees, i.e., 3 journey-level employees who work 53 1/3 hours (3 × 53 1/3 = 160). The training requirement shall not apply to any trade in which the employment of four or more journey-level employees and the trainee shall be for less than 4 consecutive weeks; provided, that 4 weeks shall mean 4 weeks of full-time work as defined by the prevailing practice in the industry for the particular craft, i.e., 160 hours (4 weeks × 40 hours), 150 hours (4 weeks × 37 1/2 hours), 140 hours (4 weeks × 35 hours), etc. The contractor shall attempt to provide continuous employment for trainees after the completion of the contract to enable them to complete their course of training. Union contractors shall refer, recommend and sponsor for union membership any of their trainees who can perform the duties of a qualified journey-level employee or who have satisfactorily completed the training program. Such former trainee shall be paid full journey-level wages and fringe benefits, whether or not union membership is granted after such referral, recommendation or sponsorship, and the contractor shall attempt to continue the employment of such persons. In the event of a failure to provide training to the required number of trainees for the required number of weeks, the contractor's compensation shall be decreased by an amount equal to the difference between the wages and fringe benefits paid by the contractor to the trainees and the wages and fringe benefits which would have been paid to the trainees had the number and duration of the positions been as required unless the contractor can demonstrate that it made a good faith effort to provide training and was unsuccessful. The wages and fringes deducted will be whatever a first term trainee would have received under the prevailing wage schedule in effect at the time the trainees should have been employed. A good faith effort includes at least:

      (i) documented efforts to secure trainees from approved training programs; and

      (ii) documented outreach efforts to New York State Employment Service, Department of Employment, TAP Centers, community and civil rights groups to identify candidates for training positions and sponsorship of those persons by the contractor for entrance into an approved training program; and

      (iii) written notification to the Division that the contractor has been unable to secure trainees pursuant to paragraphs (1) and (2) above and requesting the Division's assistance in securing trainees; provided, that neither the provisions of any collective bargaining agreement nor the refusal by a union with whom the contractor has a collective bargaining agreement to recognize the validity of the training program shall excuse the contractor's obligation to provide training pursuant to E.O. 50 (§ 10-14) and these reg- ulations. To demonstrate its good faith effort, the contractor may at its option supply documentation concerning its employment of trainees on all its construction sites, both City and non-City funded. The Division will review this documentation as part of its analysis to determine whether the contractor made a good faith effort. The contractor will also include the training provisions of this section in every subcontract in excess of $125,000 to which it becomes a party unless exempted by E.O. 50 (§ 10-14) and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder so that such provisions will be binding upon each subcontractor. The contractor will take such action with respect to any subcontract as the Division may direct as a means of enforcing such provisions, including sanctions for noncompliance. The contractor further agrees that it will assist and cooperate with the Division in obtaining the compliance of subcontractors with the requirements of E.O. 50 (§ 10-14) and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, and it will furnish the Division with information necessary for supervision of such compliance."

(c) Special provisions for city-assisted contracts. [Reserved.]

(d) Preaward compliance generally. 

   (1) No contracting agency shall enter into a construction contract in excess of $1 million, or a supply and service contract in excess of the small purchase limit established by rule of the Procurement Policy Board for procurement for goods and services when the contractor employs 50 or more employees, unless the contractor's Employment Report is first submitted to the Division for its review and approval.

   (2) The contracting agency, at the time a proposed covered contractor is identified, either through low bid or negotiation, shall notify the Division in writing of the name of the proposed contractor, the contract in question and dollar amount.

   (3) The contracting agency shall transmit a completed Employment Report to the Division within ten business days after the identification of a proposed covered contractor.

   (4) The contracting agency may thereafter award a contract, unless the Division gives prior written notice to the contracting agency and the contractor as follows:

      (i) If the Division notifies the contracting agency and the contractor within five business days after the receipt by the Division of the Employment Report that the contractor has failed to submit a complete report, the Director may require the contracting agency to disapprove the contractor unless such deficiency is corrected in a timely manner; and

      (ii) If the Division notifies the contracting agency and the contractor within fifteen business days of the receipt by the Division of the completed Employment Report that the Division's analysis of the contractor's workforce indicates underutilization and therefore the Division has reason to believe that the contractor is not in substantial compliance with applicable legal requirements and the provisions of E.O. 50 (§ 10-14) and these regulations, the Division shall promptly take such action as may be necessary to remedy the contractor's noncompliance. These time limits shall apply to the review of all Employment Reports submitted by subcontractors or contractors who are a party to a requirements contract or an open market purchase agreement.

      (iii) The time limits for this subdivision (d) begin to run on the business day following receipt of the Employment Report.

   (5) The contracting agency shall notify the Division in writing of the award of a covered contract.

   (6) With respect to covered supply and service contracts, the contracting agency shall also:

      (i) notify the Division upon the submission of the prime contractor's Employment Report of any subcontracts in excess of the small purchase limit established by rule of the Procurement Policy Board for procurements for goods and services where the subcontractor employs 50 or more employees; and

      (ii) transmit the subcontractor's completed Employment Report to the Division for review and approval.

   (7) With respect to covered construction contracts, the contracting agency shall in addition:

      (i) notify the Division in writing of its commencement to work order;

      (ii) notify the Division in writing of the contractor's application for approval of subcontractors and transmit to the Division the subcontractors' completed Employment Reports for review and approval before allowing the contractor to subcontract any work; and

      (iii) notify the Division in writing when the contract is 98 percent complete.

   (2) The Division shall conduct a preaward compliance review to determine whether the contractor maintains nondiscriminatory hiring and employment practices and is taking steps to insure that applicants are employed and that employees are placed, trained, upgraded, promoted, paid, and otherwise treated during employment without regard to race, creed, color, sex, national origin, age, handicap, marital status, sexual orientation or citizenship status.

   (3) The Division's preaward compliance review shall proceed in the following manner:

      (i) The Division shall analyze the contractor's Employment Report, with special attention directed to the composition of the work force and the contractor's employment policies, practices and procedures, including the following: recruitment, outreach, interviewing practices, pre-employment physical exams, employee evaluations, supervisor accountability, EEO training, promotional and transfer practices, training programs, employee counseling, job descriptions, architectural and other barriers, salaries and wage plans, fringe benefits, work environment, changing facilities, and collective bargaining agreements;

      (ii) If the Division deems it appropriate as part of its compliance review, or if the Office finds that the material submitted is incomplete or raises questions concerning the contractor's efforts to meet the requirements of E.O. 50 (§ 10-14) and these regulations, the Division may:

(A) hold a conference with the contractor to gain information necessary to complete the compliance review and, where necessary, to develop an Employment Program; and

(B) perform an on site review of those matters which were not fully or satisfactorily addressed in the Employment Report or at the conference.

      (iii) The Division will take into consideration consent decrees, court and administrative orders and conciliation agreements when analyzing a contractor's compliance with E.O. 50 (§ 10-14) and these regulations. The Division will not impose requirements which are inconsistent with the foregoing.

(b) Division review – supply and services contracts.

   (1) After the Division has completed its preaward compliance review and has determined that a proposed covered contractor is in compliance with the requirements of E.O. 50 (§ 10-14) and these regulations, it shall issue a certificate of compliance which shall be valid for 36 months.

   (2) After the Division has completed its preaward compliance review and has identified underutilization or employment policies and practices which mitigate against equal employment opportunity, it may negotiate an Employment Program or approve the proposed covered contractor with reservations and monitor the compliance of the contractor with E.O. 50 (§ 10-14) and these regulations during the term of the contract. The monitoring shall consist of:

      (i) an analysis of Employment Update Reports which the contractor is required to submit on a periodic basis; and

      (ii) where necessary, conferences and on site reviews.

(c) Division review – construction contracts.

   (1) During the preaward compliance review, the Division shall hold a preaward conference for contracts in excess of $1,000,000.

The contractor and the contracting agency shall be given notice if the Division's audit reveals that the contractor failed to provide training for the required number of trainees for the required number of weeks, or that the contractor has acted to circumvent the training requirements. In such case, unless the contractor can demonstrate that it made a good faith effort to provide the training, the contractor's compensation will be reduced. The Division shall evaluate all information submitted by the contractor concerning its good faith effort and consult with the contracting agency before a decision is made as to whether a training violation has occurred. The Division shall notify the contractor and contracting agency of its determination.

(d) [Reserved.]






*§ 10-06 Criteria for Compliance – Generally.* ::


The Division shall determine the contractor's compliance status after analysis of the composition of its work force and its employment policies and practices using the criteria enumerated in this section. In the event the analysis reveals that the contractor has not met the requirements of E.O. 50 (§ 10-14) and these regulations, the Division may with the contractor develop an Employment Program to correct any underutilization or employment policies and practices which mitigate against equal employment-opportunity. The Employment Program shall consist of mandated actions based upon the criteria set forth in this section.

      (i) The minority or female population of the labor area surrounding the facility or the construction site;

      (ii) The size of the minority or female unemployed work force in the labor or recruitment area surrounding the facility or the construction site;

      (iii) The percentage of the minority or female workforce as compared with the total workforce in the immediate labor area;

      (iv) The general availability of minorities or females having requisite skills in the immediate labor area;

      (v) The availability of minorities or women having requisite skills in an area in which the contractor can reasonably recruit;

      (vi) The availability of promotable and transferable minorities or women within the contractor's organization;

      (viii) The degree of training which the contractor is reasonably able to undertake as a means of making all job classes available to minorities or females.

   (3) In the event the Division's analysis reveals underutilization of minorities or women it shall:

      (i) request an explanation of the apparent underutilization; and

      (ii) consider the anticipated expansion, contraction and turnover in the workforce before developing with the contractor an Employment Program or determining if it has reasonable cause to believe that the contractor is not in compliance with E.O. 50 (§ 10-14) and these regulations.

   (4) The statistical criteria for evaluating the composition of the contractor's workforce will be the following:

      (i) the term "underutilization" means a statistically significant disparity between the employment of members of a racial, ethnic, or sexual group and their availability as determined by the Division's utilization analysis; and

      (ii) the term "utilization analysis" will mean an analysis of the contractor's workforce using standard statistical techniques to test a null hypothesis that utilization of a given protected group is within acceptable limits, given its availability. For the purpose of these regulations, the null hypothesis will be rejected (i.e., underutilization will be assumed) whenever there is reason to believe that the utilization rate is below the availability rate at the 80 percent level of significance.

(c) Analysis of policies and practices – identification of problem areas. The Division shall analyze the following policies, practices and procedures of the contractor to insure that individuals are not discriminated against on the basis of their race, creed, color, national origin, sex, age, handicap, marital status, sexual orientation or citizenship status:

   (1) A contractor shall not be in violation of E.O. 50 (§ 10-14) and these regulations if the contractor hires, employs, trains employees or otherwise discriminates on the basis of employees' creed, sex or national origin in those certain instances where creed, sex or national origin is a bona fide occupational qualification reasonably necessary to the normal operation of the contractor's business. The contractor shall have the burden of demonstrating that it has complied with the requirements of this paragraph.

   (2) A contractor shall not be in violation of E.O. 50 (§ 10-14) and these regulations with respect to age discrimination where it terminates the employment of any person who is physically unable to perform his or her duties or acts pursuant to a retirement policy or system where such policy or system is not merely a subterfuge to evade the purposes of E.O. 50 (§ 10-14) and these regulations. The contractor shall have the burden of demonstrating that it has complied with the requirements of this paragraph.

   (3) Neither the provisions of any collective bargaining agreement, nor the failure by a union with whom the contractor has a collective bargaining agreement, to refer employees without regard to their race, creed, color, national origin, sex, age, handicap, marital status, sexual orientation or citizenship status shall excuse the contractor's obligations under E.O. 50 (§ 10-14) and these regulations.

   (4) A contractor shall not be in violation of E.O. 50 (§ 10-14) and these regulations if it applies different standards of compensation or different terms, conditions or privileges of employment pursuant to a bona fide seniority system.

(e) Establishment of an employment program. If any of the following items are found by the Division in its analysis and the contractor fails to demonstrate that the item does not have a discriminatory effect, an Employment Program may be developed by the Division and the contractor containing special corrective action:

   (1) Underutilization of minorities or women in specific job groups;

   (2) Lateral or vertical movement of minority, female, handicapped or older employees occurring at a proportionately lesser rate than that of other employees;

   (6) The contracting agency shall immediately transmit certification documents it receives to OEFO.

   (7) A contractor or subcontractor shall submit such additional information as may be required by OEFO in connection with its certifications as an LBE. Failure to submit such information within 10 business days of the date of a written request may result in the denial or revocation of certification as an LBE.

   (8) Consistent with the requirements of Federal, State and City law, neither OEFO nor any contracting agency shall disclose to unauthorized persons confidential business information submitted by contractors and subcontractors.

(b) Eligibility requirements. 

   (1) A contractor or subcontractor shall be certified as an LBE upon a determination by OEFO that it has met the eligibility requirements set forth in the Administrative Code, § 6-108.1 and these regulations. The initial certification shall be effective for three years and shall expire at the end of such period, except as provided in §§ 11-03(b)(2) and (b)(9) of this section. An LBE may apply to have certification renewed after this three year period, as set forth in § 11-03(b)(4) of this section.

   (2) A business which has been in existence for less than one year prior to the date of application for certification and which would otherwise qualify as an LBE except that it does not meet the criteria set forth in § 11-02 "Locally based enterprise" (2) of these regulations, may nevertheless be certified as an LBE, provided that such certification shall expire one year after it is granted unless the business meets the criteria set forth in such paragraph within one year of the date of its certification.

   (3) An LBE seeking continuance of certification granted according to subdivision (b)(2) of this section must submit certification documents before two months prior to the one year anniversary of such certification. If after this one year period, the business meets all the criteria for LBE eligibility as set forth in § 11-02 "Locally based enterprise," certification shall be granted for two more years. This business may apply to have certification renewed after this two year period as set forth in § 11-03(b)(4).

   (4) An LBE may seek to have its certification renewed for successive one year periods by submitting certification documents before two months prior to the expiration date of its certification demonstrating that it continues to meet the eligibility requirements set forth in Administrative Code, § 6-108.1 and these regulations.

   (5) Failure to submit certification documents before two months prior to the applicable certification anniversary date, as set forth in §§ 11-03(b)(3) or (b)(4) of this section, may result in the expiration of the LBE certification on the anniversary date.

   (6) If the certification of an LBE expires or if the LBE is determined to be ineligible for re-certification, the LBE may submit another set of certification documents six months after the date its original certification expired or six months after the date it was determined to be ineligible for re-certification.

   (7) If an LBE submits certification documents before two months prior to the applicable certification anniversary date, as set forth in § 11-03(b)(3) or (b)(4) of this section, and the Division is unable to make a determination before the anniversary date, the LBE will be notified that certification will continue until the Division makes a determination as to the LBE's status. If an LBE submits certification documents within the second month prior to the anniversary date, the Division may not be able to review the documents to determine their completeness and the LBE's certification will expire. If the Division is able to review the documents, it may notify the LBE that its certification will continue beyond the anniversary date. If an LBE submits certification documents within the month prior to the anniversary date, its certification will expire on the anniversary date unless it is re-certified.

   (8) A business which was certified as an LBE prior to the effective date of these regulations shall be deemed to have been certified as an LBE on the date of such certification, provided however that any business which was less than one year old at the time of such certification and did not meet all the criteria of eligibility set forth in § 11-03 "Locally based enterprise" of these regulations, shall be deemed to have been certified according to § 11-03(b)(2) and such certification shall expire on the one year anniversary of the certification date.

   (9) Any LBE which has been certified prior to the effective date of these regulations, for a period longer than specified in §§ 11-03(b)(1) and (b)(2), must submit certification documents within two months after the effective date of these regulations, unless re-certification has been granted prior to the effective date of these regulations.

   (10) It is the intent of these regulations to qualify businesses as LBEs only if the ownership, management and operations of the business are conducted by persons who do not own, manage or operate other similar businesses which would otherwise be ineligible. Any business applying for LBE certification that does not conform to this intent shall be deemed ineligible as an LBE.

   (11) An LBE must be an independent business. A business that is a separate entity for tax or corporate purposes shall not necessarily be deemed to be an independent business. In determining whether a business is an independent business, the Division shall consider all relevant factors, including but not limited to the date the business was established, the identity of the principals, the sources of financing and the major shareholders, if any, of the business.

   (12) The owner of an LBE must possess the ability to manage the business and to make necessary management and policy decisions. The business must not be subject to any extraordinary formal or informal restrictions which limit the discretion of the owners.

   (13) The following types of ownership, control, or circumstances concerning a business seeking certification as an LBE shall render it ineligible for participation in the program:

      (i) ownership of the business by a non-LBE construction business;

      (ii) whole or partial ownership of the business by a person who is an owner in whole or in part of another construction business when the sum of the gross receipts of these businesses exceeds the limits as provided for in § 11-22 "Locally based enterprise" of these regulations;

      (iii) whole or partial ownership of a business, formed within three years of application, by a person who is an owner in whole or in part of another construction business not eligible for the program;

   (14) If, after submitting certification documents, a business is found to not meet the requirements for LBE certification as set forth in § 11-02 "Locally based enterprise" is otherwise ineligible, it may submit other certification documents for certification six months after the date it was declared ineligible.

   (15) A joint venture consisting of an LBE and a non-LBE business may participate in the LBE program as a contractor or subcontractor if both joint venturers' contract work is defined clearly. However, only the LBE's share of the contract work shall be credited towards the LBE goal.

   (16) An LBE shall notify the Division within 30 days after any change in its ownership or control. In addition, each LBE shall submit a report to the Division by December 30 of each year describing its present ownership and control. The Division shall review any changes made since an LBE's certification to determine whether it remains eligible as an LBE.

   (17) A business certified prior to the effective date of these regulations, whose ownership or control has changed shall notify the Division within 30 days of the effective date of these regulations of such change.

   (18) Newly formed businesses and businesses whose ownership or control has changed since the date of issuance of these regulations shall be scrutinized by the Division to determine the reasons for the formation, change in the ownership or control of the business.

   (19) Once a business is certified as an LBE, it must satisfactorily complete any contracts it is awarded. If an LBE does not satisfactorily complete a contract, it will be required to participate in and successfully complete a technical assistance program through the Department. If the LBE fails to successfully complete or does not participate in the technical assistance program it will be de-certified as an LBE. An LBE will be given an opportunity to respond to any allegations that it has not performed satisfactorily on a contract or that it has not successfully completed or participated in the technical assistance program pursuant to the procedure in § 11-03(c)(8). If an LBE is de-certified, such business may re-apply for certification after six months from the date of de-certification. It must demonstrate at that time that it has improved its work performance.

(c) Certification responsibilities of the Division. 

   (1) Division shall have the power to certify, re-certify and de-certify a contractor or a subcontractor as an LBE upon a determination that the contractor or subcontractor has met or failed to meet the eligibility requirements and conditions set forth in Administrative Code § 6-108.1 and these regulations.

   (5) When there is a contract pending award and a contractor has submitted incomplete certification documents, the Division shall notify the contractor either by telephone or letter within five business days of actual receipt of the documents that they are incomplete. The contractor shall have 10 business days from the date of the telephone call or from the date of the letter to complete the certification documents. If the contractor fails to submit the additional information within the time allowed, the contractor shall be so notified by the Division by letter on the next business day following the 10 day response period. Copies of this notification letter shall be sent to the prime contractor and the agency.

   (6) If complete certification documents have been submitted by a proposed LBE subcontractor for a particular contract waiting award, the Division within one business day after determining that the documents are complete, shall notify the contracting agency that the contract may be awarded.

   (7) The Division shall notify the proposed LBE contractor (and the prime contractor and the contracting agency where applicable) of its certification determination within 15 business days of the receipt of complete certification documents.

   (8) If the Division has reason to believe that an LBE is in violation of Administrative Code § 6-108.1 or these regulations, the Division shall provide notice to the LBE by certified mail, return receipt requested, of the alleged violation. Within twenty-five calendar days of the receipt of such notice the LBE may respond to the allegation in writing or request an opportunity to appear before the Commissioner or the Commissioner's designee to respond to the allegation. The Commissioner or the designee, after considering the evidence of the alleged violation and any material submitted by the LBE, shall determine whether the LBE shall be de-certified. The Commissioner or the designee may determine that a contractor or subcontractor who has been de-certified shall be ineligible for certification for a period of up to three years after such de-certification.

   (9) If at any time the Division has reason to believe that a contractor or subcontractor has willfully and knowingly provided incorrect information or made false statements, it shall refer the matter to its Inspector General for investigation. The Inspector General shall investigate the matter in accordance with applicable rules and procedures, and, where appropriate, refer or report the matter to the Department of Investigation. Falsification of any document by a contractor or subcontractor may lead to the imposition of civil and criminal penalties as provided by law and contract, disqualification from the LBE program and debarment from City contracts.

   (10) The Division shall conduct audits of LBEs to verify information provided by them.

   (11) The Division shall determine the effectiveness of Administrative Code § 6-108.1 by conducting surveys or other studies it deems appropriate.

Each contracting agency shall incorporate into all information provided to bidders on construction contracts subject to these regulations the following language: "This contract is subject to the requirements of Administrative Code § 6-108.1 and the regulations promulgated thereunder. No construction contract will be awarded unless and until these requirements have been complied with in their entirety. Be advised that:

   (1) If any portion of the contract is subcontracted, not less than 10 percent of the total dollar amount of the contract shall be awarded to locally based enterprises ("LBEs"); except, where less than 10 percent of the total dollar amount of the contract is subcontracted, such lesser percentage shall be so awarded.

   (2) No contractor shall require performance and payment bonds from LBE sub- contractors.

   (3) No contract shall be awarded unless the contractor first identifies in its bid:

      (i) the percentage, dollar amount and type of work to be subcontracted; and

      (i) The "LBE Participation Schedule" shall include:

(A) the name and address of each LBE that will be given a subcontract,

(B) the percentage, dollar amount and type of work to be subcontracted to LBE, and

   (5) Unless otherwise waived by the agency head with the approval of the Division, failure of a proposed contractor to provide the information required by paragraphs (3) and (4) above may render the bid non-responsive and the contract may not be awarded to the bidder. If the contractor states that it will subcontract a specific portion of the work, but can demonstrate that despite good faith efforts it cannot achieve its required LBE percentage for subcontracted work until after award of contract, the contract may be awarded subject to a letter of compliance from the contractor stating that it will comply with Administrative Code § 6-108.1 and subject to approval by the agency head. If the contractor has not met its required LBE percentage prior to award, the contractor shall demonstrate that a good faith effort has been made subsequent to award to obtain LBEs on each subcontract until it meets the required percentage.

   (7) The contractor may not substitute or change any LBE which was identified prior to award of the contract without the permission of the agency head. The contractor shall make a written application to the contracting agency head for permission to make such substitution or change, explaining why the contractor needs to change its LBE subcontractor and how the contractor will meet its LBE subcontracting requirement. Copies of such application must be served on the originally identified LBE by certified mail return receipt requested as well as the proposed substitute LBE. The agency head shall determine whether or not to grant the contractor's request for substitution."

(d) Implementation – general. 

   (1) Each contracting agency shall seek to reach its overall ten percent LBE goal by vigorously encouraging LBE prime participation and enforcing the ten percent (or less if applicable) LBE subcontracting requirement on all contracts where subcontracting will occur. The contracting agencies shall follow the activities outlined below to implement this requirement.

   (2) Each agency head shall designate one experienced contract manager to be its LBE liaison officer whose duties shall include directing, coordinating and overseeing agency staff with regard to implementing the procedures set forth in these regulations on a day-to-day basis. The officer's responsibilities shall include:

      (i) Examining projects to determine which invitations to bid are to be designated for the LBE prime contractor outreach procedure set forth in § 11-04(e);

      (i) the total dollar value of a contract awarded to an LBE contractor shall be applied toward the LBE goal of the contracting agency;

      (ii) the total dollar value of a subcontract let to an LBE subcontractor and performed by the LBE subcontractor shall be applied toward the contractor's LBE requirement and the LBE goal of the contracting agency (work further subcontracted by an LBE subcontractor to a non-LBE subcontractor shall not be so applied); and

      (iii) the portion of the total dollar value of a contract with a joint venture of an LBE and non-LBE business eligible under these regulations equal to the percentage of the contract work of the LBE partner in the joint venture shall be applied toward the contractor's LBE requirement and the LBE goal of the contracting agency.

   (5) When an LBE contractor or subcontractor is used, it must perform the actual work and may not subcontract the work to another firm without agency approval. Credit may be denied to a prime contractor for an LBE subcontractor's participation where an LBE does none of the actual subcontracted work.

   (6) The contracting agency shall transmit to the Division certification documents submitted to it within two business days after their receipt.

   (7) If at any time a contracting agency has reason to believe that a contractor or subcontractor has willfully and knowingly provided incorrect information or made false statements, it shall refer the matter to both its Inspector General and to the Division.

   (2) No contractor shall require performance and payment bonds from LBE sub- contractors.

   (3) The bidder shall identify in the bid proposal:

      (i) the percentage, dollar amount and type of work to be subcontracted; and

      (ii) the percentage, dollar amount and type of work to be subcontracted to LBEs.

   (4) Within 10 calendar days after notification of low bid, the apparent low bidder shall submit an "LBE Participation Schedule". If such schedule does not identify enough LBE subcontractors to meet the requirements of Administrative Code § 6-108.1 the apparent low bidder shall also submit documentation of its good faith efforts to meet such requirements.

      (i) The "LBE Participation Schedule" shall include:

(A) the name and address of each LBE that will be given a subcontract,

(B) the percentage, dollar amount and type of work to be subcontracted to the LBE, and

(C) the dates when the LBE subcontract work will commence and end.

      (iii) Documentation of good faith efforts to achieve the required LBE percentage shall include but not be limited to the following:

(A) attendance at pre-bid meetings, when scheduled by the agency, to advise bidders of contract requirements;

(B) advertisement where appropriate in general circulation media, trade association publications, and small business media for specific subcontracts that would be at least equal to the percentage goal for LBE utilization specified by the contractor;

   (5) Failure of the apparent low bidder to provide the information required in §§ 11-04(g)(3) and (g)(4) of this section within the allotted time may render the bid non-responsive and the contract may not be awarded to the bidder, except: If the contractor states that it will subcontract a specific portion of the work, but can demonstrate that despite good faith efforts it cannot achieve its required LBE percentage for subcontracted work until after award of contract, the contract may be awarded subject to a letter of compliance from the contractor stating that it will comply with Administrative Code § 6-108.1 and subject to approval by the agency head.

   (6) If the contractor has not met its required LBE percentage prior to award, the contractor shall demonstrate that a good faith effort has been made subsequent to award to obtain LBEs on each subcontract until it meets the required percentage.

   (7) If a contractor submits certification documents for a subcontractor it wishes to use towards its LBE required percentage, the contracting agency may not award the contract until the Division has notified it that such certification documents are complete. After the Division has notified the agency that the proposed subcontractor's certification documents are complete, the contract may be awarded. However, no firm may be counted toward the contractor's LBE obligation unless it has been certified as an LBE. The Division shall notify the prime contractor that the certification documents of its proposed subcontractor are complete and that its certification is pending and is subject to review. It shall inform the prime contractor that if the proposed subcontractor is denied certification, the prime contractor must propose another LBE.

   (8) If a contractor states prior to award that it will not subcontract work under the contract, the contractor may not subcontract any work without prior approval by the contracting agency. Such a contractor shall notify the agency at least six weeks prior to the start of work by any subcontractor that subcontracting is proposed. During such six-week period the contractor shall seek LBEs to do the work. No subcontracting by such a contractor shall be approved unless the required percentage of subcontracting work is awarded to an LBE, or unless the agency grants a waiver from such requirement upon a finding that a good faith effort has been made to find an LBE.

   (9) The contractor may not substitute or change any LBE which was identified prior to award of the contract without the permission of the agency head. The contractor shall make a written application to the contracting agency head for permission to make such substitution or change, explaining why the contractor needs to change its LBE subcontractor and how the contractor will meet its LBE subcontracting requirement. Copies of such application must be served on the originally identified LBE by certified mail return receipt requested as well as the proposed substitute LBE. The agency head shall determine whether or not to grant the contractor's request for substitution.

   (10) If the contractor contends that the LBE requirement cannot be met either before or after contract award and can demonstrate a good faith effort to obtain an LBE, a waiver may be granted by the agency head upon approval by the Division.

(h) Subcontractor waivers. 

   (1) Subject to approval by the Division, an agency head may waive the subcontracting requirements of Administrative Code § 6-108.1 and these regulations upon a finding that:

      (i) there is no identifiable LBE subcontractor reasonably available, willing and qualified to perform subcontracted work, provided that

(A) the contractor has been unable to identify an LBE subcontractor after good faith efforts as set forth in § 11-04(g)(4)(iii) and

(B) the contracting agency has been unable to locate an LBE after a search of the LBE list; or

      (ii) the contract involves an emergency requiring immediate attention because the public health, safety, or welfare is threatened; or

      (iii) for other good cause. Such finding shall be made in writing, state the reasons therefore, and be submitted to the Division if a waiver is requested.

   (2) The Division may direct an agency head to submit further evidence concerning the necessity for a waiver.

   (3) Upon the approval of an agency head's waiver decision, the Division shall send written notification of such waiver to the Vice Chairman of the City Council.

      (i) Verification of contractor compliance. The contracting agency shall perform the following procedures with regard to auditing contractor compliance:

   (1) The LBE liaison officer described in § 11-04(d)(2) of these regulations shall distribute to the resident engineer a list of LBE subcontractors that have been identified by the prime contractor for use on the project. The resident engineer shall notify the LBE liaison officer of all subcontractors working on the site.

   (2) As the work progresses, the LBE liaison officer shall periodically telephone all LBEs identified by the prime contractor to verify that they are on the site and performing specified LBE work.

   (3) Each contracting agency shall conduct on-site reviews of the contractor's compliance with the LBE requirements. Such review may include interviews, visits to the actual construction site, and an inspection of any records relevant to the contractor's performance.

   (4) The contractor shall cooperate fully with these reviews. Failure or refusal to furnish information or to cooperate may be deemed a breach of contract and a violation of these regulations which may result in the imposition of sanctions as provided in § 11-04(j).

   (5) The LBE liaison officer shall audit contractor payments to LBE subcontractors by obtaining payment compliance reports every month from both the contractor and the LBE subcontractor. The agency shall investigate all significant report variances.

   (6) The LBE liaison officer shall review total payments of prime contractors to LBE subcontractors to insure that the amount equals the LBE percentage required by the contract. If the sum of LBE subcontractor payments is less than the required amount, the contractor may be found in breach of contract and sanctions may be applied in an amount commensurate with the magnitude of noncompliance.

   (7) The LBE liaison officer shall maintain an LBE file for each project whether or not it is subject to LBE requirements. When the contracting agency determines that the program does not apply to a project or any part of it, the reasons for that decision shall be placed in the file.

   (8) After review of the contractor's performance, the contracting agency shall make one of the following determinations with respect to the contractor's compliance with the LBE requirements:

      (i) the contractor is in compliance; or

      (ii) there is reasonable cause to believe that the contractor is in noncompliance.

   (9) Whenever a contracting agency has reasonable cause to believe that a contractor is in noncompliance, it shall send a notice promptly by certified mail, return receipt requested, to the contractor describing the noncompliance and requiring the contractor to show cause within five days why it should not be found in noncompliance. If the agency determines that there is noncompliance, it shall offer the contractor a 15-day period from the date of notification of the determination an opportunity to conciliate.

      (i) If conciliation is successful, a conciliation agreement shall be signed by the agency and the contractor and filed with the Division.

      (ii) If conciliation is not successful, the agency shall determine whether sanctions should be imposed.

   (10) The contracting agency shall notify the Division of any determination of noncompliance and the imposition of any sanctions. The Division shall notify all other contracting agencies of the determination and the sanctions imposed.

(j) Sanctions. 

   (1) When a contracting agency determines that a prime contractor has failed to comply with the requirements of Administrative Code § 6-108.1 or these regulations, the agency may impose any or all of the following sanctions:

      (i) Reducing of a contractor's compensation by an amount equal to the dollar value of the LBE required percentage not complied with;

      (ii) Declaring the contractor in default.

   (2) (a) The division and the city chief procurement officer will develop a citywide utilization plan for the procurements of goods.

(b) Agencies will develop agency utilization plans pursuant to § 11-64 of this subchapter. The citywide goals will not be summarily adopted as goals for all annual agency utilization plans; rather, goals for such plans may be set at levels higher, lower, or the same as the citywide goals, subject to the approval of the commissioner as described in paragraph three of § 11-64 of this subchapter. When setting its goals, each agency must consider the citywide goals, the size and nature of its own procurement portfolio, and the availability of MBEs, WBEs and EBEs with the capacity to perform the specific types and scale of work for which the agency anticipates it will solicit procurements during the year. Agencies will seek to ensure substantial progress toward the attainment of these goals in as short a time as practicable.

   (3) The citywide goals will not be summarily adopted as goals for individual procurements; rather, as set forth in § 11-66 of this subchapter, goals for such procurements may be set at levels higher, lower, or the same as the citywide goals. In setting such goals, each agency must take into account the citywide goals and the agency's annual utilization plan, the size and nature of the procurement, and the availability of MBEs, WBEs and EBEs with the capacity to perform the specific types and scale of work involved in its procurements.

   (4) a) No later than 2015, the commissioner, in consultation with the city chief procurement officer, will, for each industry classification and each minority group, review and compare the availability rates of firms owned by minorities and women to the utilization rates of such firms in agency contracts and direct subcontracts, and will on the basis of such review and any other relevant information, where appropriate, revise by rule the citywide participation goals set forth in this section. In making such revision, the commissioner will consider the extent to which discrimination continues to have an impact on the ability of minorities and women to compete for city contracts and subcontracts. The commissioner will submit the results of such review and any proposed revisions to the participation goals to the speaker of the council at least sixty days prior to publishing a proposed rule that would revise participation goals. Such review will thereafter be conducted at least once every two years.

(b) No later than 2015, the commissioner will review information collected by the department to determine the availability and utilization of EBEs, and will on the basis of such review and any other relevant information, where appropriate, revise by rule the citywide participation goals set forth in this section. Such revised goals will be set at a level intended to assist in overcoming the impact of discrimination on such businesses. Such review will be conducted in 2015 and at least once every two years thereafter.






*§ 11-62 Responsibilities of the Division.* ::


(1)  The division will create and maintain and periodically update directories by industry classification of MBEs, WBEs and EBEs which it will supply to all agencies, post on its website and on other relevant city websites and make available for dissemination and/or public inspection at its offices and other locations within each borough. In addition, the division will prepare, periodically update, and post on the division's website a directory of such city certified business enterprises for use by city agencies and contractors, which will include, but is not limited to, the following information for each such business enterprise, as applicable: (i) identification of the market sector in which the business enterprise operates; (ii) the bonding capacity of the business enterprise; (iii) the union affiliation, if any, of the business enterprise; (iv) the contract price and specific tasks performed by the business enterprise for its last three contracts; and (v) the renewal date for the business enterprise's certification.

   (2) The division will make its resources available to assist agencies and contractors in (i) determining the availability of MBEs, WBEs and EBEs to participate in their contracts as prime contractors and/or subcontractors; and (ii) identifying opportunities appropriate for participation by MBEs, WBEs and EBEs in contracts.

   (3) The division will develop and maintain relationships with organizations representing contractors, including MBEs, WBEs and EBEs, and solicit their support and assistance in efforts to increase participation of MBEs, WBEs and EBEs in city procurement.

   (4) The division will coordinate with city and state entities that maintain databases of MBEs, WBEs and EBEs and work to enhance city availability data and directories.

   (5) The division will keep agency M/WBE officers informed of conferences, contractor fairs, and other services that are available to assist them in pursuing the objectives of this section.

   (6) The division will conduct, coordinate and facilitate technical assistance and educational programs for MBEs, WBEs and EBEs and other contractors designed to enhance participation of MBEs, WBEs and EBEs in city procurement. The division will further develop a clearinghouse of information on programs and services available to MBEs, WBEs and EBEs. The division will conduct meetings with MBEs, WBEs and EBEs to discuss what agencies look for in evaluating bids and proposals. The division will also educate prime contractors on opportunities to partner or subcontract with certified MBEs, WBEs and EBEs.

   (7) The division will develop standardized forms and reporting documents for agencies and contractors to facilitate the reporting requirements of this section.

   (8) The division will direct and assist agencies in their efforts to increase participation by MBEs, WBEs and EBEs in any city-operated financial, technical, and management assistance program.

   (9) The division will study and recommend to the commissioner methods to streamline the M/WBE and EBE certification process.

   (10) Each fiscal year the division, in consultation with the city chief procurement officer, will audit at least 5% of all open contracts for which contractor utilization plans have been established in accordance with § 11-66 of this subchapter and 5% of all contracts awarded to MBEs, WBEs and EBEs to assess compliance with this subchapter. All solicitations for contracts for which contractor utilization plans are to be established will include notice of potential audit.

   (11) The division will assist agencies in identifying and seeking ways to reduce or eliminate practices such as bonding requirements or delays in payment by prime contractors that may present barriers to competition by MBEs, WBEs and EBEs.

   (12) The division will encourage prime contractors to enter joint venture agreements with MBEs, WBEs and EBEs.

   (13) The division will assist appropriate certified business enterprises in becoming prequalified for those categories of procurement for which they may be eligible and for which contracting agencies utilize prequalification in the procurement process;

   (14) (a) The division will, upon reviewing applications for certification and recertification, determine whether a firm qualifies as a graduate MBE, WBE, or EBE.

(b) At any time more than two years after the division has determined that a firm qualifies as a graduate MBE, WBE or EBE, the firm may apply to have such designation lifted. The division will lift the designation if the firm demonstrates that it has not been awarded contracts by one or more agencies within the past three years where the total city funding from the expense and capital budgets for such contracts was equal to or greater than fifty million dollars and it has been below the size standards established by the United States small business administration for its industry for a period of two years or more.






*§ 11-63 Responsibilities of Agency M/WBE Officers.* ::


Each agency head will designate a deputy commissioner or other executive officer to act as the agency M/WBE officer who will be directly accountable to the agency head concerning the activities of the agency in carrying out its responsibilities pursuant to this section, including the responsibilities relating to EBE participation. The duties of the M/WBE officer will include, but not be limited to:

   (1) creating the agency's utilization plan in accordance with § 11-64 of this subchapter;

   (2) acting as the agency's liaison with the division;

   (3) acting as a liaison with organizations and/or associations of MBEs, WBEs and EBEs, informing such organizations and/or associations of the agency's procurement procedures, and advising them of future procurement opportunities;

   (4) ensuring that agency bid solicitations and requests for proposals are sent to MBEs, WBEs and EBEs in a timely manner, consistent with this section and rules of the procurement policy board;

   (5) referring MBEs, WBEs and EBEs to technical assistance services available from agencies and other organizations;

   (6) reviewing requests for waivers and/or modifications of participation goals and contractor utilization plans in accordance with § 11-66 of this subchapter;

   (7) working with the division and city chief procurement officer in creating directories of certified MBEs, WBEs and EBEs pursuant to § 11-68 of this subchapter. In fulfilling this duty, the agency M/WBE officer will track and record each contractor that is an MBE, WBE or EBE and each subcontractor hired pursuant to such officer's agency contracts that is an MBE, WBE or EBE, and will share such information with the director, the commissioner, and the city chief procurement officer;

   (8) for contracts for which contractor utilization plans have been established pursuant to § 11-66 of this subchapter, monitoring each contractor's compliance with its utilization plan by appropriate means, which will include, but need not be limited to, job site inspections, contacting MBEs, WBEs and EBEs identified in the plan to confirm their participation, and auditing the contractor's books and records;

   (9) monitoring the agency's procurement activities to ensure compliance with its agency utilization plan and progress towards the participation goals as established in such plan;

   (10) providing to the city chief procurement officer information for the reports required in § 11-69 of this subchapter and providing any other plans and/or reports required pursuant to this subchapter or requested by the director and/or the city chief procurement officer; and

   (11) participating in meetings required pursuant to § 11-70 of this subchapter.






*§ 11-64 Agency Utilization Plans.* ::


(1)  Beginning May 15, 2006, and on April 1 of each year thereafter, each agency which, during the fiscal year which ended on June 30 of the preceding year, has made procurements in excess of five million dollars, without counting procurements exempt pursuant to paragraph two of § 11-74 of this subchapter, must submit an agency utilization plan for the fiscal year commencing in July of the year when such plan is to be submitted to the commissioner. Upon approval by the commissioner such plan will be submitted to the speaker of the council. Each such plan will, at a minimum, include the following:

(a) the agency's participation goals for MBEs, WBEs and EBEs for the year, provided however, that when setting its goals, each agency must consider the citywide goals, the size and nature of its own procurement portfolio (excluding contracts described in paragraph two of § 11-74 of this subchapter), and the availability of MBEs, WBEs and EBEs with the capacity to perform the specific types and scale of work for which the agency anticipates it will solicit procurements during the year;

(b) an explanation for any agency goal that is different than the participation goal for the relevant group and industry classification as determined pursuant to § 11-61 of this subchapter;

(c) a list of the names and titles of agency personnel responsible for implementation of the agency utilization plan;

(d) methods and relevant activities proposed for achieving the agency's participation goals; and

(e) any other information which the agency or the commissioner deems relevant or necessary.

   (2) An agency utilization plan must set forth specific participation goals for MBEs, WBEs and/or EBEs for purchases of professional services, standard services, construction and goods valued at or below twenty thousand dollars, and for purchases of professional services, standard services, construction and goods valued at or below one hundred thousand dollars. When setting its goals for such purchases, in addition to the factors set forth in paragraph (1) of this section, each agency must specifically consider the potential for such purchases to provide opportunities for MBEs, WBEs and EBEs to develop greater capacity, thereby increasing competition for city procurements.

   (3) An agency utilization plan may be amended from time to time to reflect changes in the agency's projected expenditures or other relevant circumstances and resulting changes in such agency's participation goals. Such amendments must be submitted to the commissioner, the city chief procurement officer and the speaker of the council at least thirty days prior to implementation.

   (4) In planning its procurement activities over the course of the fiscal year, each agency subject to this section must consider how it will achieve the goals set forth in its approved agency utilization plan. This determination should be guided by the agency's knowledge of the market involved in the procurement, and the level of progress it has made during the fiscal year toward meeting its goal for the relevant category of procurement.

   (5) Prior to approving individual agency utilization plans, the commissioner, in consultation with the city chief procurement officer, will consider whether such plans viewed in the aggregate establish any goals exceeding the corresponding citywide goals set forth in § 11-61 of this subchapter. If the commissioner, in consultation with the city chief procurement officer, finds any aggregated goals exceed the corresponding citywide goal, the commissioner will require agencies to adjust their goals so that plans, viewed in the aggregate, do not establish goals exceeding the citywide goals. Nothing in this paragraph will be construed to limit the award of contracts and subcontracts that may be made to MBEs, WBEs and EBEs without using goals.

   (6) The commissioner, in consultation with the city chief procurement officer, will, no later than July 31 of each year, publish on the division's website a plan and schedule for each agency detailing the anticipated contracting actions for the upcoming fiscal year that form the basis for the agency utilization plan of each such agency. The plan and schedule will include information specific to each prospective invitation for bids, request for proposal, or other solicitation, including, but not limited to, the specific type and scale of the services and/or goods to be procured, the term of the proposed contract, the method of solicitation the agency intends to utilize, and the anticipated fiscal year quarter of the planned solicitation.






*§ 11-65 Achieving Agency Participation Goals.* ::


(1)  Each agency head must be directly accountable for the goals set forth in his or her agency's utilization plan.

   (2) Each agency must make all reasonable efforts to meet the participation goals established in its agency utilization plan. Agencies will, at a minimum, use the following methods to achieve participation goals:

(a) Agencies must engage in outreach activities to encourage MBEs, WBEs and EBEs to compete for all facets of their procurement activities, including contracts awarded by negotiated acquisition, emergency and sole source contracts, and each agency will seek to utilize MBEs, WBEs and/or EBEs for all types of goods, services and construction they procure.

(b) Agencies must encourage eligible businesses to apply for certification as MBEs, WBEs and EBEs and inclusion in the directories of MBEs, WBEs and EBEs. Agencies must also encourage MBEs, WBEs and EBEs to have their names included on their bidders lists, seek pre-qualification where applicable, and compete for city business as contractors and subcontractors. Agencies are encouraged to advertise procurement opportunities in general circulation media, trade and professional association publications and small business media, and publications of minority and women's business organizations, and send written notice of specific procurement opportunities to minority and women's business organizations.

(c) All agency solicitations for bids or proposals must include information referring potential bidders or proposers to the directories of MBEs, WBEs and EBEs prepared by the division.

(d) In planning procurements, agencies must consider the effect of the scope, specifications and size of a contract on opportunities for participation by MBEs, WBEs and EBEs.

(e) Prior to soliciting bids or proposals for contracts valued at over ten million dollars, other than contracts for capital projects valued at over twenty-five million dollars and contracts that are exempt pursuant to paragraph two of § 11-74 of this subchapter, an agency must submit the bid or proposal to the city chief procurement officer for a determination whether it is practicable to divide the proposed contract into smaller contracts and whether doing so will enhance competition for such contracts among MBEs, WBEs and EBEs and other potential bidders or proposers. The agency must follow the instructions of the city chief procurement officer in cases where he or she determines that it is both practicable and advantageous in light of cost and other relevant factors to divide such contracts into smaller contracts.

(f) Agencies must examine their internal procurement policies, procedures and practices and, where practicable, address those elements, if any, that may negatively affect participation of MBEs, WBEs and EBEs in city procurement.






*§ 11-66 Participation Goals for Contracts for Construction and Professional and Standard Services.* ::


   (1) Prior to issuing the solicitation of bids or proposals for individual contracts, agencies must establish participation goals for MBEs, WBEs and/or EBEs. Such goals may be greater than, less than or the same as the relevant citywide goal or goals established pursuant to § 11-61 of this subchapter. Taking into account the factors listed in this subdivision, an agency may establish a goal for a procurement that may be achieved by a combination of prime contract and subcontract dollars, a combination of construction and services performed pursuant to the contract, and/or a combination of MBEs, WBEs and/or EBEs. Alternatively, an agency may establish specific goals for particular types of services, and/or goals for particular types of certified firms. In determining the participation goals for a particular contract, an agency must consider the following factors:

(a) the scope of work;

(b) the availability of MBEs, WBEs and EBEs able to perform the particular tasks required in the contract;

(c) the extent to which the type and scale of work involved in the contract present prime contracting and subcontracting opportunities for amounts within the capacity of MBEs, WBEs and EBEs;

(d) the agency's progress to date toward meeting its annual participation goals through race-neutral, gender-neutral and other means, and the agency's expectations as to the effect such methods will have on participation of MBEs, WBEs and EBEs in the agency's future contracts; and

(e) any other factors the contracting agency deems relevant.

   (2) A contracting agency shall not be required to establish participation goals

      (i) for procurements described in § 11-74 of this subchapter; or

      (ii) when the agency has already attained the relevant goal in its annual utilization plan, or expects that it will attain such goal without the use of such participation goals.

   (3) For each contract in which a contracting agency has established participation goals, such agency shall state in the solicitation for such contract that bidders and/or proposers shall be required to agree as a material term of the contract that the contractor must meet the participation goals unless such goals are waived or modified by the agency in accordance with this section. An agency must permit a contractor that is an MBE, WBE or EBE to count its own participation toward fulfillment of the relevant participation goal, provided that the agency has determined the value of such a contractor's participation by subtracting from the total value of the contract any amounts that the contractor pays to direct subcontractors. An agency must permit a contractor that is a qualified joint venture to count a percentage of its own participation toward fulfillment of the relevant participation goal. The agency must determine the value of such a contractor's participation by subtracting from the total value of the contract any amounts that the contractor pays to direct subcontractors, and then multiplying the remainder by the percentage to be applied to total profit to determine the amount to which an MBE, WBE or EBE is entitled pursuant to the joint venture agreement. Notwithstanding any provision of this paragraph to the contrary, a contractor's achievement of participation goals must be determined as described in paragraph two of § 11-67 of this subchapter.

   (4) For each contract in which participation goals are established, the agency must include in its solicitation and/or bidding materials, a referral to the directories prepared by the division pursuant to § 11-62 of this subchapter.

   (5) For each contract for which participation goals are established the contractor must submit with its bid or proposal a utilization plan indicating:

(a) whether the contractor is an MBE, WBE, EBE, or a qualified joint venture;

(b) the percentage of work it intends to award to direct subcontractors; and

(c) in cases where the contractor intends to award direct subcontracts, a description of the type and dollar value of work designated for participation by MBEs, WBEs and/or EBEs, and the time frames in which such work is scheduled to begin and end. When the contractor utilization plan indicates that the bidder or proposer does not intend to meet the participation goals, the bid or proposal will not be deemed responsive unless the agency has granted a pre-award request for change pursuant to subdivision 11 of this section.

   (6) a) For each contract for which a contractor utilization plan has been submitted, the contracting agency must require that within thirty days of the issuance of notice to proceed, and at least once per year thereafter, the contractor submit a list of persons to which it intends to award subcontracts within the next twelve months, and a written confirmation that the contractor has notified each MBE, WBE or EBE included in such list. For multi-year contracts, the contractor must submit such a list of persons and written confirmation of notification to the agency annually. In the event that a contracting agency disapproves a contractor's selection of a subcontractor or subcontractors, the contracting agency must allow such contractor a reasonable time to propose alternate subcontractors.

(b) The contracting agency may also require the contractor to report periodically about the contracts awarded by its direct subcontractors to indirect subcontractors.

   (7) For each contract for which a contractor utilization plan has been submitted, the contractor must, with each voucher for payment, and/or periodically as the agency may require, submit statements, certified under penalty of perjury, which must include, but not be limited to, the total amount the contractor paid to its direct subcontractors, and, where applicable pursuant to subparagraph (l) of paragraph (1) of § 11-67 of this subchapter, the total amount direct subcontractors paid to indirect subcontractors, the names, addresses and contact numbers of each MBE, WBE or EBE hired as a subcontractor by the contractor or any of the contractor's direct subcontractors, as well as the dates and amounts paid to each MBE, WBEs or EBEs. The contractor must also submit, along with its voucher for final payment, the total amount it paid to subcontractors, and, where applicable pursuant to subparagraph (l) of paragraph (1) of § 11-67 of this subchapter, the total amount its direct subcontractors paid directly to their indirect subcontractors; and a final list, certified under penalty of perjury, which must include the name, address and contact information of each subcontractor that is an MBE, WBE or EBE, the work performed by, and the dates and amounts paid to each.

   (8) If payments made to, or work performed by, MBEs, WBEs or EBEs are less than the amount specified in the contractor's utilization plan, the agency must take appropriate action in accordance with § 11-72 of this subchapter, unless the contractor has obtained a modification of its utilization plan pursuant to paragraph 12 of this section.

   (9) When advertising a solicitation for bids or proposals for a contract for which a participation goal has been established, the agency must include in the advertisement a general statement that the contract will be subject to participation goals for MBEs, WBEs and/or EBEs.

   (10) In the event that a contractor with a contract that includes a contractor utilization plan submits a request for a change order the value of which exceeds the greater of ten percent of such contract or $500,000, the agency must review the scope of work for the contract, and the scale and types of work involved in the change order, and determine whether the participation goals should be modified.

   (11) Requests from bidders or proposers for changes in participation goals.

(a) A bidder or proposer may request that an agency change the participation goal or goals established for the procurement on the grounds that goals are unreasonable in light of the availability of certified firms to perform the services required, or by demonstrating that it has legitimate business reasons for proposing a lower level of subcontracting in its utilization plan.

(b) If the contracting agency determines that the participation goals established for the procurement are unreasonable in light of the availability of certified firms to perform the services required, it must revise the solicitation and extend the deadline for bids and proposals.

(c) Subject to paragraph (d) of this section, the contracting agency may grant a full or partial waiver of the participation goals to a bidder or proposer who demonstrates that it has legitimate business reasons for proposing the level of subcontracting in its utilization plan. The contracting agency will make its determination in light of factors that must include, but not be limited to, whether the bidder or proposer has the capacity and the bona fide intention to perform the contract without any subcontracting, or to perform the contract without awarding the amount of subcontracts represented by the participation goals. In making such determination, the agency may consider whether the utilization plan is consistent with past subcontracting practices of the bidder or proposer, whether the bidder or proposer has made efforts to form a joint venture with a certified firm, and whether the bidder or proposer has made good faith efforts to identify portions of the contract that it intends to subcontract. The city chief contracting officer will notify the council of any such waiver granted with respect to a registered contract in the quarterly report required pursuant to § 11-69 of this subchapter.

(d) The agency M/WBE officer shall provide written notice of requests for a full or partial waiver of the participation goals to the division and the city chief procurement officer and will not approve any such request without the approval of the city chief procurement officer, provided that the city chief procurement officer, upon adequate assurances of an agency's ability to administer its utilization plan in accordance with the provisions of this section, may determine that further approval from the city chief procurement officer is not required with respect to such requests for an agency's contracts or particular categories of an agency's contracts. The city chief procurement officer will notify the speaker of the council and the division in writing in the quarterly report required pursuant to § 11-69 of this subchapter following the registration of the contract for which the agency granted a request for a full or partial waiver of a participation goal, provided that where an agency has been authorized to grant waivers without approval of the chief procurement officer, such notice will be provided to the speaker of the council and the division by the agency. Such notification will include, but not be limited to, the name of the contractor, the original participation goal, the waiver request, including all documentation, and an explanation for the approval of such request.

   (12) Modification of utilization plans at contractor's request or agency's initiative. A contractor may request modification of its utilization plan after the award of a contract. Subject to paragraph (b) of this section, an agency may grant such request if it determines that such contractor has established, with appropriate documentary and other evidence, that it made all reasonable, good faith efforts to meet the goals set by the agency for the contract. In making such determination, the agency will consider evidence of the following efforts, as applicable, along with any other relevant factors:

      (i) The contractor advertised opportunities to participate in the contract, where appropriate, in general circulation media, trade and professional association publications and small business media, and publications of minority and women's business organizations;

      (ii) The contractor provided notice of specific opportunities to participate in the contract, in a timely manner, to minority and women's business organizations;

      (iii) The contractor sent written notices, by certified mail or facsimile, in a timely manner, to advise MBEs, WBEs and EBEs that their interest in the contract was solicited;

      (iv) The contractor made efforts to identify portions of the work that could be substituted for portions originally designated for participation by MBEs, WBEs and/or EBEs in the contractor utilization plan, and for which the contractor claims an inability to retain MBEs or WBEs or EBEs;

      (v) The contractor held meetings with MBEs, WBEs and/or EBEs prior to the date their bids or proposals were due, for the purpose of explaining in detail the scope and requirements of the work for which their bids or proposals were solicited. Documentation of such meetings must include the dates, times, and locations of such meetings, meeting announcements and invitations, meeting agendas, documents distributed at such meetings, and attendance lists;

      (vi) The contractor made efforts to negotiate with MBEs, WBEs and/or EBEs as relevant to perform specific subcontracts, or act as suppliers or service providers.

   (14) For each contract in which a contracting agency has established participation goals, the agency will evaluate and assess the contractor's performance in meeting each such goal. Such evaluation and assessment must be a part of the contractor's overall contract performance evaluation required pursuant to § 333 of the charter.

(1)  An agency's achievement of its annual goals will be calculated as follows:

   (a) The dollar amount that an agency has paid or is obligated to pay to a prime contractor which is an MBE, WBE or EBE, reduced by the dollar amount the contractor has paid or is obligated to pay its direct subcontractors upon their completion of work, will be credited toward the relevant goal. Where an agency has paid or is obligated to pay a prime contractor that is both an MBE and a WBE, such amount will be credited toward the relevant goal for MBEs or the goal for WBEs.

   (b) Except as provided in subparagraph (c) of this paragraph, the total dollar amount that a prime contractor of any agency has paid or is obligated to pay to a direct subcontractor that is an MBE, WBE or EBE will be credited toward the relevant goal. Where such a contractor has paid or is obligated to pay a direct subcontractor that is both an MBE and a WBE, such amount will be credited toward the relevant goal for MBEs or the goal for WBEs.

   (c) In the case of contracts of the types identified pursuant to subparagraph (l) of this paragraph, the total dollar amount that a prime contractor of an agency has paid or is obligated to pay a direct subcontractor that is an MBE, WBE, or EBE, reduced by the dollar amount the direct subcontractor has paid or is obligated to pay its indirect subcontractors upon completion of work, will be credited toward the relevant goal. Where such a contractor has paid or is obligated to pay a direct contractor that is both an MBE and a WBE, such amount will be credited toward the relevant goal for MBEs or the goal for WBEs.

   (d) In the case of contracts of the types identified pursuant to subparagraph (l) of this paragraph, the total dollar amount that a direct subcontractor of the prime contractor has paid or is obligated to pay to an indirect subcontractor that is an MBE, WBE or EBE will be credited toward the relevant goal. Where such a contractor has paid or is obligated to pay an indirect contractor that is both an MBE and a WBE, such amount will be credited toward the relevant goal for MBEs or the goal for WBEs.

   (e) For requirements contracts, credit will be given for the actual dollar amount paid under the contract.

   (f) Where one or more MBEs, WBEs or EBEs is participating in a qualified joint venture, the amounts that the joint venture is required to pay its direct subcontractors will be subtracted as provided in subparagraph (a) of this paragraph, and then a percentage of the remaining dollar amount of the contract equal to the percentage of total profit to which MBEs, WBEs or EBEs are entitled pursuant to the joint venture agreement will be credited toward the relevant goal. Where such a participant in a joint venture is both an MBE and a WBE, such amount will be credited toward the relevant goal for MBEs or the goal for WBEs.

   (g) No credit will be given for participation in a contract by an MBE, WBE or EBE that does not perform a commercially useful function.

   (h) No credit will be given for the participation in a contract by any company that has not been certified as an MBE, WBE or EBE in accordance with § 1304 of the charter.

   (j) No credit will be given to a contractor for participation in a contract by a graduate MBE, WBE or EBE.

   (k) The participation of a certified company will not be credited toward more than one participation goal.

   (l) The city chief procurement officer may identify types of contracts where payments to indirect subcontractors will be credited toward the relevant participation goals.

(2) A contractor's achievement of its participation goals established in its utilization plan will be calculated as follows:

   (a) A contractor's use of direct subcontractors and their indirect subcontractors toward achievement of each goal established in its utilization plan will be calculated in the same manner as described for calculating the achievement of agency utilization goals as described in paragraph (1) of this subdivision, except that a contractor's use of a subcontractor that is both an MBE and a WBE will not be credited toward the contractor's achievement of more than one goal;

   (b) An agency must permit a contractor that is an MBE, WBE or EBE to count its own participation toward fulfillment of the relevant participation goal, provided that the value of such a contractor's participation be determined by subtracting from the total value of the contract any amounts that the contractor pays to direct subcontractors, and provided further that a contractor that is both an MBE and a WBE will not be credited for its participation toward more than one goal;

   (c) No credit will be given to the contractor for the participation of a company that is not certified in accordance with § 1304 of the charter before the date that the subcontractor completes the work under the subcontract.

   (d) An agency will permit a contractor that is a qualified joint venture to count a percentage of its own participation toward fulfillment of the relevant participation goal. The value of such a contractor's participation will be determined by subtracting from the total value of the contract any amounts that the contractor pays to direct subcontractors, and then multiplying the remainder by the percentage to be applied to total profit to determine the amount to which an MBE, WBE or EBE is entitled pursuant to the joint venture agreement; provided that where such a participant in a joint venture is both an MBE and a WBE, such amount will not be credited toward more than one goal.

      (iii) whether socially and economically disadvantaged individuals show that they devote time on an ongoing basis to the daily operation of the business enterprise.

   (2) Articles of incorporation, corporate by-laws, partnership agreements, business certificates, corporate tax returns, unincorporated business tax returns, partnership tax returns and other agreements, including, but not limited to, loan agreements, lease agreements, supply agreements, credit agreements or other agreements must permit socially and economically disadvantaged individuals who claim ownership of the business enterprise to make those decisions pertaining to operations of the business enterprise without restrictions.

   (3) Socially and economically disadvantaged individuals must demonstrate control of negotiations, signature authority for payroll, leases, letters of credit, insurance bonds, banking services and contracts, and other business transactions through production of relevant documents.

(d) Additional eligibility provisions. The following provisions apply to all applicants seeking certification as an EBE:

   (1) Where the actual management of the business enterprise is contracted out to individuals other than socially and disadvantaged individuals, socially and economically disadvantaged individuals must demonstrate that they have the ultimate power to hire and fire these managers, that they exercise this power and make other substantial decisions which reflect control of the business enterprise;

   (2) Documentation of one (1) year's business activity will be required in order to provide sufficient information upon which certification can be reasonably made. The commissioner, in his or her discretion, may permit documentation for a lesser period;

   (3) DSBS may grant eligible status to any business enterprise eligible under § 11-82 of these rules, and certified as an EBE or disadvantaged business enterprise by another governmental or other certifying entity whose emerging business enterprise or disadvantaged business enterprise certification criteria are determined by the commissioner to be consistent with the certification criteria set forth in these rules. Unless otherwise determined by the commissioner, the maximum period for which any certification granted by DSBS pursuant to this subdivision is valid will be the period during which the business enterprise is certified as an EBE or disadvantaged business enterprise with the original certifying entity;

   (4) Any business enterprise that satisfies the eligibility criteria as set forth in § 11-82 of these rules is presumptively eligible for certification under these rules; provided that the commissioner may decline to certify, or revoke the certification of, any business enterprise on the ground that there is not a firm basis for believing that there is a compelling state interest to justify certification of that business enterprise under these rules.

(e) Evidence of social and economic disadvantage. (1)(A) Evidence of individual social disadvantage must include the following elements: (i) At least one objective distinguishing feature that has contributed to social disadvantage, such as physical or mental disability, long-term residence in an environment isolated from the mainstream of United States society, or other similar causes not common to individuals who are not socially disadvantaged;

      (ii) Personal experiences of substantial and chronic social disadvantage in United States society, not in other countries; and

      (iii) Negative impact on entry into or advancement in the business world because of the social disadvantage. DSBS will consider any relevant evidence in assessing this element. In every case, however, DSBS will consider education, employment and business history, where applicable, to see if the totality of circumstances shows disadvantage in entering into or advancing in the business world.

(B) Education. DSBS will consider such factors as denial of equal access to institutions of higher education, exclusion from social and professional association with students or teachers, denial of educational honors rightfully earned, and social patterns or pressures which discouraged the individual from pursuing a professional or business education.

(C) Employment. DSBS will consider such factors as unequal treatment in hiring, promotions and other aspects of professional advancement, pay and fringe benefits, and other terms and conditions of employment; retaliatory or discriminatory behavior by an employer; and social patterns or pressures which have channeled the individual into nonprofessional or non-business fields.

(D) Business history. DSBS will consider such factors as unequal access to credit or capital, acquisition of credit or capital under commercially unfavorable circumstances, unequal treatment in opportunities for government contracts or other work, unequal treatment by potential customers and business associates, and exclusion from business or professional organizations.

   (2) Evidence of individual economic disadvantage must include the following elements: (A) Submission of narrative and financial information. (i) Each individual claiming economic disadvantage must describe it in a narrative statement, and must submit personal financial information supporting the assertions contained in the narrative statement.

      (ii) An individual claiming economic disadvantage who is married or a member of a domestic partnership must submit separate financial information for his or her spouse or domestic partner, provided that such financial information will not be required where the individual and the spouse are legally separated.

(B) DSBS evaluation of diminished capital and credit opportunities. DSBS will examine factors relating to the personal financial condition of any individual claiming disadvantaged status, including personal income for the past two years (including bonuses and the value of company stock given in lieu of cash), personal net worth, and the fair market value of all assets, whether encumbered or not. DSBS will also consider the financial condition of the applicant compared to the financial profiles of small businesses in the same primary industry classification, or, if not available, in similar lines of business, which are not owned and controlled by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals in evaluating the individual's access to credit and capital. The financial profiles that DSBS compares will include total assets, net sales, pre-tax profit, sales/working capital ratio, and net worth.

(C) Transfers within two years.

   (1) Except as set forth in § 11-82(e)(2)(C)(2), DSBS will attribute to an individual claiming disadvantaged status any assets which that individual has transferred to an immediate family member, or to a trust a beneficiary of which is an immediate family member, for less than fair market value, within two years prior to a business enterprise's application for participation in the EBE program or within two years of a participant's annual renewal, unless the individual claiming disadvantaged status can demonstrate that the transfer is to or on behalf of an immediate family member for that individual's education, medical expenses, or some other form of essential support.

   (2) DSBS will not attribute to an individual claiming disadvantaged status any assets transferred by that individual to an immediate family member that are consistent with the customary recognition of special occasions, such as birthdays, graduations, anniversaries, and retirements.

   (3) In determining an individual's access to capital and credit, DSBS may consider any assets that the individual transferred within such two-year period described by § 11-82(e)(2)(C)(1), that DSBS does not consider in evaluating the individual's assets and net worth (e.g., transfers to charities).

(b) Net worth. For EBE eligibility, the net worth of an individual claiming disadvantage must be less than one million dollars. In determining such net worth, DSBS will exclude the ownership interest in the applicant and the applicant's equity in the primary personal residence (except any portion of such equity which is attributable to excessive withdrawals from the applicant). Exclusions for purposes of determining net worth are not exclusions for asset valuation or access to capital and credit purposes. A contingent liability does not reduce an individual's net worth.

(f) * Graduate EBE determinations. The division will, upon reviewing applications for certification and recertification, determine whether a business enterprise qualifies as a graduate EBE. The division will make such determinations in accordance with the following procedures:

   (1) In the event that the division determines a business enterprise seeking new certification as an EBE qualifies as a graduate EBE pursuant to § 11-81 of these rules, the division will provide a written notice of such determination to the applicant business enterprise stating the reason(s) for such determination and the procedures for challenging the graduate EBE determination.

   (2) In the event that the division determines a certified EBE qualifies as a graduate EBE pursuant to § 11-81 of these rules, the division will provide a written notice of such determination to the business enterprise seeking recertification setting forth the reason(s) for such determination and the procedures for challenging the graduate EBE determination.

   (3) In the event that the division determines a business enterprise seeking new certification or a certified EBE to be a graduate EBE pursuant to § 11-81 of these rules, the business enterprise may challenge such a determination pursuant to the procedures set forth in §§ 11-84 and 11-85 of these rules.

   (4) In the event that the division has determined a business enterprise to be a graduate EBE, and the business enterprise has not made a timely challenge to that determination, or has made such a challenge and the department has affirmed its determination, the business enterprise may not apply to have the designation lifted for at least two years from the date of the original determination notice. The division will lift the designation if the firm demonstrates that: (i) it has not been awarded contracts by one or more agencies within the past three years where the total city funding from the expense and capital budgets for such contracts was equal to or greater than fifty million dollars; and (ii) it has been below the size standards established by the United States small business administration for its industry for a period of two years or more.






*§ 11-83 Application Intake and Verification.* ::


(a)  Emerging business enterprise certification applications may be obtained from, and must be returned to DSBS. DSBS will date stamp the date of receipt of a certification application upon receiving it.

(b) An applicant must submit such information or documentation as may be required by DSBS in connection with its certification as an EBE. Failure to submit such information or documentation may result in the rejection or revocation of such certification.

(c) If a certification application is received by DSBS and required documents are missing, questions are unanswered or the certification application is not properly notarized, DSBS must send to the applicant, within forty-five (45) days of the initial date stamped on the certification application, a notice of status and deficiency (the "Notice"), stating any deficiency arising from missing documents, unfinished questions or deficiencies in notarization. An applicant may cure the noticed deficiency by providing DSBS with documents or information requested in the Notice, within thirty (30) days of the date of the Notice.

(d) When the applicant cures a noticed deficiency, pursuant to procedures set forth in § 11-83(c) of these rules, DSBS has an additional forty-five (45) days to advise the applicant of any further deficiency which may be cured in accordance with § 11-83(c) of these rules.

(e) If the applicant does not cure a noticed deficiency, pursuant to procedures set forth in § 11-83(c) of these rules, and the certification application remains incomplete for at least forty-five (45) days of the date of the Notice, unless such time is extended by the certification director, the applicant must be sent a notice stating that its certification application has been rejected and will not be processed, together with its rejected certification application.

(f) An applicant whose certification as an EBE is rejected may not reapply for certification for at least one hundred twenty (120) days of the date of the notice of rejection of its application.

(g) Applicants may be required to consent to inquiries of their bonding companies, banking institutions, credit agencies, contractors, affiliates, clients and other entities to ascertain the applicant's eligibility for certification. Refusal to permit such inquiries will be grounds for rejection of a certification application.

(h) All applicants and certified businesses will be subject to an audit at any time. An applicant's or certified business' refusal to facilitate an audit will be grounds for denial of its certification application or revocation of its certification.

(i) A certification application may be withdrawn by an applicant without prejudice at any time prior to an audit. Following the withdrawal of a certification application, the applicant may not reapply for certification for a period of at least one hundred twenty (120) days from the date of withdrawal of the application.

(j) All applicants and certified businesses may be required to provide documentation to substantiate that the business has the skill and expertise to perform in the particular area of work for which it is requesting listing or is listed on the EBE Directory.

(k) The division will conduct site visits for at least 5% of all EBE certification applications received during a fiscal year to verify that such business enterprises are eligible for certification under these rules.






*§ 11-84 Notice of Determination and Right to Appeal.* ::


(a)  The director of certification shall provide the applicant with written notice of a determination approving or denying certification.

(b) In the event certification is approved by the director of certification, the applicant will be sent a certification letter and will be certified as an EBE for five (5) years from the date of the certification letter or until notified for the need to reapply at the director of certification's request, whichever is earlier.

(c) In the event certification is denied by the director of EBE, a written notice of such determination shall be provided to the applicant stating the reason(s) for such denial. Such notice shall also state the procedures for filing an appeal.

(d) The applicant may appeal the determination within thirty (30) days after the date of the notice denying the business enterprise's certification. In the event that a request for an appeal is not made within the thirty (30) day period, the director of certification's determination shall be deemed final and the applicant may not reapply for certification for two (2) years from the date of the written notice denying certification, provided, however, that if the facts and circumstances forming the basis of the denial decision have changed significantly, the applicant, at the discretion of the director of certification, may be granted permission to reapply sooner.

(e) The request for an appeal shall state the grounds upon which the denial of certification is being appealed.






*§ 11-85 Appeals.* ::


A business entity denied certification or re-certification as an EBE shall be given written notice by DSBS of the grounds for such denial and an opportunity to appeal such denial in writing to the commissioner. Such appeal or a request for an extension to file an appeal, must be received by the commissioner no later than thirty (30) days after the date of the notice denying the business enterprise's certification or re-certification. The commissioner may extend the period in which to initiate an appeal for good cause shown. Such appeal shall include, at a minimum, a description of the reasons why the decision to deny certification or re-certification is in error and provide evidence to support its appeal. Such person shall provide such other documentation or information as is requested by the commissioner, in his or her sole discretion. The commissioner shall render a written determination no later than sixty days after receipt of the appeal, unless the time to render a determination has been extended upon agreement of the commissioner and the business enterprise. If the commissioner's determination is not made within the prescribed sixty days after receipt of the appeal or within the agreed upon extended time period, then the appeal is deemed denied. The decision of the commissioner granting or denying such appeal shall constitute the final agency determination.






*§ 11-86 Revocation of Emerging Business Enterprise Status.* ::


(a)  A certified business must notify DSBS within forty-five (45) days of any material change in the information contained in the original certification application. A material change may include, but is not limited to, a change in any of the following: ownership; address; officers; or services provided by the certified business. If a material change occurs, a review may be conducted by DSBS and certification may be revoked. If an EBE's certification is revoked, such business enterprise may reapply for certification at any time following revocation. If a certified business fails to notify the director of EBE of such material change, the director of EBE may in his or her discretion, revoke the certification of an EBE for a period of up to five (5) years.

(b) DSBS, upon having reason to believe or upon receiving allegations indicating that a certified business enterprise is not eligible for certification as an EBE, may meet with socially and economically disadvantaged persons claiming ownership and control of the certified business and/or conduct an audit of such business enterprise, and shall take the following actions:

   (1) Determine whether the allegation can be substantiated;

   (2) Obtain in writing, if possible, the basis of any allegation from the person or persons making the allegation;

   (3) Notify a certified business in writing that its certification as an EBE is under review by the director of EBE and may be revoked. This notice shall specify the bases for such review and any facts specifically at issue; and

   (4) Provide the certified business with an opportunity to respond in writing to any allegations set forth in any notices questioning the certification status of a certified business, within thirty (30) days of the date of such notice, by personal service or certified mail, return receipt requested.

(c) If the socially and economically disadvantaged persons claiming ownership of the certified business fail to respond timely in writing to the notice of certification status review, or fail to meet with a DSBS representative or agree to an audit, the certification of the EBE may be revoked by the director of certification.

(d) The director of certification shall notify, in writing, a certified business of the revocation of its certification as an EBE within fourteen (14) days of revoking such certification. The socially and economically disadvantaged persons claiming ownership and control of a business enterprise which has had its certification as an EBE revoked may request an appeal of this decision within thirty (30) days of the date of the notice of revocation. Such appeal shall be conducted in accordance with procedures set forth in § 11-84 of these rules. If a request for an appeal is not made within the thirty (30) day period, the director of certification's determination shall be final and the business enterprise may not reapply for certification for two (2) years from the date of the notice of revocation provided, however, that if the facts and circumstances forming the basis of the revocation decision have changed significantly, the business enterprise may, at the discretion of the director of certification, be granted permission to reapply sooner.

(e) If at any time DSBS has reason to believe that an applicant or certified business has willfully and knowingly provided incorrect information or made false statements, it shall refer the matter to the Department of Investigation for investigation. Falsification of any document by an applicant or a certified business may lead to the imposition of civil and criminal penalties as provided by law and contract, de-certification as an EBE and the inclusion of an advice of caution in the City Vendor Information Exchange System ("VENDEX") database.
