*§ 1-02 Microtrenching Permitted: Notifications to the Department.* ::


(a) An owner may perform microtrenching to the extent allowed by a permit issued by the Department of Transportation. New microtrenching will not be permitted where sufficient excess capacity is available in existing microtrenching. Before applying to the Department of Transportation for such a permit, the owner must obtain a certification from the Department that no excess capacity is available in the location the owner proposes for microtrenching. The owner must submit that certification to the Department of Transportation as part of the owner's application for a permit.

(b) An owner must install conduit in a way that will readily permit another owner to add length to the microtrenching by connecting its own conduit to the first owner's conduit. Where an owner connects its own conduit to another owner's previously installed conduit, the owner must install conduit that has the same number of pathways or pipes as the previous owner's conduit.

(c) Microtrenching will be permitted only for:

   a. fiber-optic service to properties within the following zoning districts as defined pursuant to the New York City Zoning Resolution: R1, R2, R2A, R2X, R3, R3-1, R3-2, R3-A, R3-X, R4, R4-1, R4A, R4B, R5, R5-A, R5-B, R5-D, C1-1, C1-2, C1-4, C1-5, C2-1, C2-2, C2-3, C2-4, C2-5, C-3, C4 (but only to premises with a commercial floor area ratio of 2.0 or less), M-1 (but only to premises with a manufacturing floor area ratio of 2.0 or less), M-2, M-3, and special purpose districts (but only to premises with a floor area ratio of 2.0 or less); and

(d) Before applying for a permit for microtrenching from the Department of Transportation the owner must submit the following documents to the Department:

   a. Proof of security. "Proof of security" means proof that the issuer of any bond, insurance, letter of credit or other security issued in connection with the owner's telecommunications franchise agreements has agreed to extend the coverage of such security to the owner's microtrenching, without change to any other terms and conditions of such security that are for the benefit of the Department or the City. The Department will have the right to draw on the security to cover any unpaid fines assessed pursuant to section 1-07(c) of this chapter, or to cover any unmet obligation to remove conduit pursuant to section 1-06 of this chapter.

   b. Indemnification. The owner shall execute an indemnification agreement prepared by the Department.

(e) After obtaining a permit for microtrenching from the Department of Transportation, but before beginning mictrotrenching construction, the owner must notify the Department of the intended dates of the start and completion of microtrenching construction. Notification must be made on a form and in a format prescribed by the Department.

(f) Promptly after completion of microtrenching construction, and at most within 40 calendar days after the Department of Transportation issued the permit for microtrenching, the owner must file a document with the Department, in a format to be prescribed by the Department, containing the following information:

   a. An "as-built" drawing of the conduit installed. The "as-built" drawing will be treated as proprietary and confidential, to the extent permitted by law.

   b. A map showing the street location of the conduit including the side of the street the conduit is on, the beginning and ending points of the conduit, the number of ducts in the conduit, and the number of ducts of excess capacity in the conduit. The map must accurately reflect the addresses of buildings that are passed by the conduit. The map may be made public, by itself or in aggregation with other maps, at the discretion of the Department.

 






*§ 1-03 Requirement to Install Excess Capacity.* ::


(a) The owner must use microtrenching materials and equipment that will facilitate the use of excess capacity by telecommunications franchisees.

(f) The owner must respond to a request to use excess capacity within fifteen business days of the owner's receipt of the request. The owner's response must either approve or deny the request, and if the owner denies the request the owner must state the reasons for the denial. If the request is a City request, the owner must submit its response to the Department. If the request is by a telecommunications franchisee, the owner must submit its response to the telecommunications franchisee and simultaneously submit a copy of its response to the Department.

(g) The owner must make excess capacity available to telecommunications franchisees on a first-come, first-served basis. However, the owner is not obligated to provide excess capacity to a telecommunications franchisee other than for the actual use for the telecommunications franchisee's business or customers. That is, a telecommunications franchisee may not reserve or use excess capacity for the possibility of future use or for hoarding. Also, the telecommunications franchisee may not sublease excess capacity.

(h) The owner must make excess capacity available to a telecommunications franchisee no later than 45 calendar days of the owner's receipt of the telecommunications franchisee's request, unless the owner denies the request as provided by subdivision (f) or (g) of this section.

(i) If a telecommunications franchisee does not complete the installation of fiber-optic cable within 45 calendar days after the owner makes excess capacity available to the telecommunications franchisee, the owner may deem any portion of the excess capacity that the telecommunications franchisee did not occupy by that time to be available to other telecommunications franchisees as provided by subdivision (g) of this section.

(j) Making excess capacity available to the City and to telecommunications franchisees includes making available the opportunity to enter and connect to the conduit at the nearest manhole or similar utility access space.

(k) No later than ten business days after the end of each calendar quarter, the owner must submit a report to the Department, in a format to be prescribed by the Department, stating:

(l) No later than January 20 of each year, the owner must submit a report to the Department, in a format to be prescribed by the Department, stating the location of each conduit repair and service outage that occurred in the owner's microtrenching during the previous year.






*§ 1-06 The Owner's Obligation to Remove or Otherwise Dispose of Conduit.* ::


(a) If an owner no longer intends to maintain conduit in working order and good repair, the owner must either remove the conduit at its own expense, or, at the Department's option, transfer the conduit to another owner, or otherwise dispose of the conduit as directed by the Department.

(b) If an owner's telecommunications franchise or microtrenching permit is terminated or revoked, or if an owner's right to own microtrenching is revoked, the owner must either remove the conduit at its own expense, transfer the conduit to another owner, or otherwise dispose of the conduit as directed by the Department.

(c) If the Department determines that microtrenching is unsuitable or unsafe, either entirely or under specified conditions, the owner must remove the conduit and fiber-optic cable at the owner's expense, or, at the Department's option, transfer title to the conduit and fiber-optic cable to the City without fee or cost.

The owner must provide access to individuals, documents, records and information as may be reasonable and appropriate to such audit, investigation or review.

(c) In the event of a violation of the rules of this chapter, the Department may initiate proceedings before the Office of Administrative Trials and Hearings (OATH) to seek the imposition of penalties on an owner, including fines or revocation or other limitation of the owner's right to engage in microtrenching. The rules of OATH will apply to such proceedings. Those rules are set forth in title 48, chapter 1 of the Rules of the City of New York.

   a. Following a hearing, an administrative law judge will issue a report and recommendation to the Commissioner of the Department or his or her designee. The report and recommendation will state proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law, and a recommended disposition. The responding party will have ten business days from the date of the report and recommendation to submit comments on the report and recommendation to the Commissioner. The Commissioner will issue a final decision, subject only to judicial review.

   b. Penalties include fines no less than $100 and no more than $25,000 per violation, termination of the owner's right to engage in additional microtrenching, and revocation of the owner's right to own microtrenching. Factors relevant to the determination of the penalty include the severity of the offense; whether the offense was willful or inadvertent; whether the offense furthered the owner's evasion of oversight and monitoring; the degree of the cost, disadvantage or inconvenience imposed on others by the offense; and the owner's history of offenses, if any.

   c. Violations include the following. (Descriptions are for informational purposes only; the text of the rule itself determines the scope and meaning of the rule.)

*§ 1-08 Miscellaneous Provisions.* ::


(a) Conduit that was installed before the effective date of this chapter, in compliance with the terms of a microtrenching pilot program, will be allowed to remain in place despite any non-compliance with sections 1-02 or 1-03 of this chapter. All of the other rules of this chapter apply to such conduit.

(b) An owner may transfer ownership of conduit to another entity that would be an "owner" as defined by section 1-01(g) of this chapter. A transfer may not be made effective before the submission to the Department of the contract or other document effectuating the transfer.

(c) To the extent that any applicable federal or state law or regulation requires an owner to make excess capacity available to a person or entity more expeditiously or on any other term more favorable to that person or entity than a term provided for by the rules of this chapter, then the applicable federal or state law or regulation applies with respect to such persons or entities instead of the term provided for by the rules of this chapter.

(d) By voluntarily choosing to install conduit pursuant to this chapter, an owner agrees that the owner will not charge telecommunications franchisees any fees or costs for the use or occupancy of duct installed pursuant to this chapter greater than the fees provided in section 1-05(b) of this chapter; represents that the owner has received any regulatory permission, approval or authority that may be required to install such conduit and to charge such fees; and acknowledges that the City of New York relies on that agreement and that representation in furtherance of the City's interests in expanding fiber-optic cable deployment, especially in underserved areas.

(e) The provisions of this chapter that require an owner to install excess capacity, to make it available to telecommunications franchisees, and to forego any fees and costs except as provided in section 1-05(b) of this chapter that might otherwise be permitted by any applicable rate regulation are integral to this chapter and essential to the City's purposes in promulgating this chapter. The City's determination to permit microtrenching is expressly based on the assumptions that an owner's conduit will include excess capacity and that the excess capacity will be available to telecommunications franchisees without payment of any fees or costs except as provided in section 1-05(b) of this chapter. Therefore, if any court or other tribunal of competent jurisdiction invalidates any of those provisions, this chapter will be invalidated in its entirety and microtrenching will not be permitted, and owners must remove or otherwise dispose of all conduit as directed by the Department.

   (2) The Commissioner shall notify the permittee of his or her intention to terminate the permit and the reason for such proposed action. No later than five business days following such notification, the permittee may submit a letter to the Commissioner setting forth any reasons why such permit should not be terminated and such telephone removed.

Except as provided in subdivision (d) of this section the owner shall respond no later than five business days following such notice. Such response shall either: (i) certify to the Commissioner that such condition has been corrected in accordance with the manner specified by the Commissioner in such notice; or (ii) set forth the reasons why the Commissioner should not take the proposed action. Failure of an owner to timely respond to such notice by the Commissioner shall constitute default, and shall subject the owner to revocation of the permit and removal of the telephone pursuant to the provisions of subdivision (a) of this section. The Commissioner shall review the response of the permittee and notify the permittee of the final determination and the reasons therefor.

(d) Expedited removal of public nuisance.

In no case, however, shall a public pay telephone installation be placed within eighteen (18) inches of a curb or within ten (10) feet from a corner or constitute an impediment to pedestrian traffic or interfere with the function of fire escapes or the unimpeded passage of building inhabitants.
