Chapter 2: Burial Claims

(a) The laws of the state of New York require that New York City be responsible for the burial of poor people who reside here. New York City meets these requirements in two ways. For those deceased persons who do not have a friend or relative who is willing to arrange for burial, the deceased is interred in New York City's burial ground (known as "Potter's Field"). For those deceased persons who have a friend or relative who wishes to arrange for burial through a funeral director, New York City will help pay burial expenses if there is no legally responsible relative living with the deceased at the time of death or prior to the institutionalization of the deceased who is financially able to pay for the burial. These regulations explain when and how much New York City will pay for the burial expenses when the funeral was arranged by a friend or relative.

(b) Benefits will be provided in an amount not to exceed $800 if burial expenses do not exceed $1,400. The only exclusions from this $1,400 are the cost of the burial plot on behalf of the deceased and the grave opening or the cost of cremation and any costs required by the cemetery. All other costs will be included in determining the total costs of the burial expenses for purposes of determining the $1,400 limitation set forth above. Where a burial follows a cremation, only the cost of the cremation shall be excludable. Applications for benefits must be made in person by the individual who authorized the funeral unless the application is made by an "organizational friend" as defined in 68 RCNY § 2-02 "Friend" (2).

The completion date shall not be later than two years from the date of enrollment of any public assistance recipient, except as may otherwise be required pursuant to applicable law.

   (5) If it has been subject to an employment placement rate review, as described in 68 RCNY § 3-04, it has a current Certificate of Approval Following Employment Placement Rate Review or a current Certificate of Conditional Approval Following Employment Placement Rate Review.






*§ 3-04 Employment Placement Rate Review.* ::


(a)  Once every six months, an employment training program which has had sufficient public assistance recipient enrollees to form a cohort, as described herein, shall be subject to an employment placement rate review to determine its continued eligibility for approval, as follows:

   (1) For vocational training programs, the minimum size of a cohort, as defined in 68 RCNY § 3-02, shall be 25. A vocational training program shall pass the employment placement rate review if 40% of persons in the cohort have secured paid employment at any time following their date of enrollment up to the date the employment placement rate review is completed.

   (2) For literacy programs, the minimum size of a cohort, as defined in 68 RCNY § 3-02, shall be 50. A literacy program shall pass the employment placement rate review if the following percentage of persons in the cohort have secured paid employment at any time following their date of enrollment up to the date the employment placement rate review is completed:

      (i) For a review conducted in 1996, 10%;

      (ii) For a review conducted in 1997 or thereafter, 15%.

   (3) For job placement programs, the minimum size of a cohort, as defined in 68 RCNY § 3-02, shall be 25.

An associate's degree program or other post-secondary two-year degree program shall pass the employment placement rate review if the following percentage of persons in the cohort have secured paid employment at any time following their date of enrollment up to the date the employment placement rate review is completed:

      (i) For a review conducted in 1996, 25%;

      (ii) For a review conducted in 1997 or thereafter, 30%.

   (5) Where an institution provides more than one type of employment training program, such as a job placement program and a literacy program, OES shall review such programs separately to determine whether each program is subject to and passes the employment placement rate review standards for the relevant program.

(b) Documentation of placement rate: OES shall consider the following evidence to determine placement rate:

   (1) Acceptable documentation of students engaged in paid employment provided to OES by an employment training program or any other person. Employment training programs shall submit such information by the applicable deadline for the cohort review. For each enrollee or former enrollee, such documentation must contain all of the following information:

      (i) A recent pay stub, or an original of correspondence from the employer confirming the employment.

      (ii) The public assistance recipient's name and social security number.

      (iii) The employer's name, address and telephone number.

      (iv) The job title, date on which employment started, date on which employment ended (if applicable), and salary, indicating whether it is on an hourly, per diem, weekly, biweekly, or monthly basis.

   (2) Information obtained by matching enrollment lists with the New York State Welfare Management System database to identify persons whose cases have been closed or rebudgeted since the date of their enrollment in the employment training program.

(c) As evidence of an enrollee's completion, withdrawal or removal from an employment training program, OES shall accept only a copy of an "Attendance and Satisfactory Progress" roster report that was generated by the appropriate OES unit or office and completed by an appropriate officer of the employment training program.

(d) If, after performing the employment placement rate review, OES determines that an employment training program has not placed the required percentage of public assistance recipient enrollees, it shall send the program a "Notice of Intent to Disapprove." This notice shall include a list of those public assistance recipients whose scheduled date of completion was during the period relevant to the employment placement rate review, for whom OES has not received information confirming paid employment, or the closure or rebudgeting of their case.

(e) An employment training program shall have ten days from the date of the "Notice of Intent to Disapprove" to provide notice to OES that it intends to contest the dis- approval.

(f) An employment training program which has filed notice pursuant to paragraph (e) shall have thirty days from the date of the "Notice of Intent to Disapprove" to submit documentation of additional placements, documentation showing that persons who were included in the placement rate review should not have been included, and a written statement explaining any other reasons why it should not be disapproved. Documentation shall be submitted in accordance with the provisions of subdivisions (b) and (c) of this section.

(g) When the employment placement rate review is complete, and OES has considered any materials timely submitted by an employment training program following its receipt of a Notice of Intent to Disapprove, OES shall determine whether the program shall be approved or disapproved. It shall send a "Certificate of Approval Following Employment Placement Review" to those programs which have passed the review, in accordance with the requirements for passing set forth in subdivisions a through c of this section. It shall send a "Notice of Disapproval Following Employment Placement Review" to all other programs that have been reviewed.

(h) A Notice of Disapproval Following Employment Placement Review shall notify the employment training program that it may submit to OES a "Corrective Action Plan" specifying steps that the program will take to attain the required placement rate, as set forth in subdivision a of this section. If OES determines that the Corrective Action Plan is acceptable, it shall send the program a "Certificate of Conditional Approval". Such Certificate shall not take effect until 90 days after the date of Notice of Disapproval Following Job Placement Review. Until the Certificate of Conditional Approval takes effect, the program shall be suspended. Notwithstanding any provision of this paragraph, a program shall not be suspended based on the results of the first Employment Placement Review of the program following the effective date of these rules, if it has submitted a Corrective Action Plan which has been approved by OES.

(i) A Certificate of Conditional Approval shall remain in effect until the next time an employment training program has undergone an employment placement rate review. While a Certificate of Conditional Approval is in effect, OES shall limit the number of public assistance recipients for whom it approves training-related expenses to participate in the program. The maximum number shall be the greater of: (i) 25 recipients, or (ii) 10% of the number of public assistance recipients whose placement rate was evaluated during the employment placement rate review.

(j) A Certificate of Approval Following an Employment Placement Rate Review shall remain in effect until OES has completed a new employment placement rate review and issued a new Certificate of Approval or a Notice of Disapproval Following Employment Placement Rate Review.

(b) Any program that fails to submit such documentation for any month shall receive a Notice of Disapproval for Failure to Submit Documentation of Attendance.

(c) A program that has received such a notice shall not be approved until it has submitted to OES a Corrective Action Plan which has been approved by OES, and ninety days have passed since the date of the notice; provided that OES may waive the ninety day period.






*§ 3-07 Standards for Approval of Enrollment and Requests for Training Related Expenses for Public Assistance Recipients.* ::


(a)  A public assistance recipient who wishes to enroll in an employment training program, and in connection therewith to receive training related expenses and/or be excused from other OES work-related requirements, shall submit to OES a "School Enrollment Form" that has been completed by an appropriate officer of the employment training program. A public assistance recipient who is enrolled in an associate's degree or other post-secondary two-year degree program shall submit a "School Enrollment Form" at the beginning of each semester.

(b) OES will review and make a determination of whether to approve the request of a public assistance recipient to participate in an employment training activity according to the following criteria and applicable State regulations:

   (1) The employment training program must be approved as described in 68 RCNY § 3-03, and must not be under suspension for failure to comply with any provision of these rules.

   (2) In the case of an employment training program for which OES has granted a conditional approval, a public assistance recipient's request will be approved only if the number of public assistance recipients who have enrolled in the program since the date of issuance of the Certificate of Conditional Approval is below the maximum number allowed as set forth in subdivision i of 68 RCNY § 3-04.

   (3) If the public assistance recipient has already received training related expenses to attend a total of twenty-four months of training in one or more employment training programs (regardless of whether such twenty-four months were interrupted by any period of time during which the recipient was not enrolled in an employment training program), OES may, at its discretion, and subject to applicable federal and State law and rules, allow the recipient to continue receiving training related expenses and/or exemption from other work-related activities on condition that the recipient continues to make satisfactory progress; withdraw approval for further training related expenses or a further exemption; or require that the recipient participate in other OES work-related activities while the recipient remains in the program and continues to receive training related expenses. Nothing herein shall be deemed to limit the ability of OES to assign a public assistance recipient to work-related activities, consistent with applicable law.

   (4) In the case of a request to continue attendance in an associate's degree or other post-secondary two-year degree program, OES may deny approval to a student who has not accumulated sufficient credits to earn the degree in accordance with his or her scheduled date of completion.

   (5) OES may withdraw approval for any recipient who is not attending at least 75% of the scheduled classes or is not making satisfactory progress in the employment training program.

   (6) OES may withdraw or deny approval for any recipient to participate in an employment training program or limit the number of hours of participation for which approval will be given to meet state law requirements pertaining to work and employment training activities, including but not limited to participation rate requirements.

(c) Except as otherwise provided pursuant to federal and State law and rules for hardship cases or as a reasonable accommodation for a person with a disability, a public assistance recipient who enrolls in an associate's degree or other post-secondary two-year degree program must attend the program on a full time basis.

(d) Public assistance recipients who enroll in part time or evening employment training programs may be required to participate in concurrent employment related ac- tivities.

(e) [Reserved.]

(f) When a public assistance recipient has been receiving training related expenses and/or an exemption from requirements to participate in other OES work-related activities because such recipient has been enrolled in an employment training program, and the recipient does not complete that program by the recipient's scheduled date of completion, OES may, at its discretion, subject to applicable federal and State law and rules, allow the recipient to continue receiving training related expenses and an exemption from other work-related activites on condition that the recipient continues to make satisfactory progress; withdraw approval for further training related expenses or a further exemption; or require that the recipient participate in other OES work-related activities while the recipient remains in the program and continues to receive training related expenses.

(g) When approval is denied or withdrawn pursuant to this section, the recipient shall receive such notice and hearing with respect to such actions as are required pursuant to the rules of the New York State Department of Social Services.






*§ 3-08 Fraudulent Application for Training Related Expenses.* ::


OES shall not approve the application for training related expenses and/or an exemption from other OES work-related activities of a public assistance recipient who knowingly and willingly submits to OES a falsified or fraudulent School Enrollment Form or any other employment training or employment-related document. Such a recipient may be subject to restrictions on eligibility for future employment training activities, and may also be subject to additional sanctions and criminal prosecution. The recipient shall receive such notice and hearing with respect to such actions as are required pursuant to the rules of the New York State Department of Social Services.






*§ 3-09 Consequences of Enrollment in a Program that Becomes Disapproved.* ::


(a)  In the event that an employment training program becomes disapproved for failure to pass the employment placement rate review, or for the reasons set forth in subdivisions b or c of 68 RCNY § 3-05, a public assistance recipient who is already enrolled in the program at the time it is disapproved shall continue to receive training related expenses and/or be excused from other OES work-related activities until the earlier of the recipient's training completion date, or the date when the recipient withdraws from the program or OES withdraws approval pursuant to paragraph 5 of subdivision b of 68 RCNY § 3-07.

(b) In the event that an employment training program becomes disapproved pursuant to subdivision a of 68 RCNY § 3-05, a public assistance recipient enrolled in such program shall not receive further training related expenses or continue to be excused from other OES work-related activities. Such a recipient may immediately submit a School Enrollment Form for another employment training program.

Chapter 4: Distribution of Food and Administrative Funds To Emergency Food Providers
--------------------------------------------------



*§ 4-01 Definitions.* ::


EFAP. EFAP shall stand for the Emergency Food Assistance Program. The City-funded program aids emergency food providers by supplying them with food and administrative funds.

Food provider. A "food provider" shall mean a food pantry, soup kitchen or other similarly constituted non-profit food program which provides food to people based on their having inadequate income to meet their immediate need for food, and which has been certified by the Human Resources Administration to participate in EFAP.

Food pantry. A "food pantry" distributes food packages containing canned and other non-perishable food items which are to be prepared and eaten at home. More than one meal per individual is provided in the food package.

Soup kitchen. A "soup kitchen" serves meals to individuals in a congregate setting or through other direct distribution (i.e., van distribution of meals to homeless in parks and other public places). Typically, one meal per individual is served.

Cycle. A "cycle" is a six month period.

Administration. The "Administration" shall mean the Human Resources Admin- istration.

EFAP Advisory Group. The EFAP Advisory Group shall consist of persons active or concerned with the operation of emergency food programs. The group is chosen by the Administration for advice on the implementation of the Emergency Food Assistance Program.






*§ 4-02 [Eligibility.]* ::


To be eligible to receive funds from EFAP, each food provider must meet the following eligibility criteria:

(a) no charges or fees may be assessed for the food provided through EFAP; (b) the provider must have sources of food other than the Administration;

(c) the provider must serve a minimum of 100 meals per month;

(d) EFAP food cannot be used to serve an organization's "institutional resident" population. (Residents of institutions are those individuals entitled to at least two meals per day as part of the institutions normal service. Examples: Homeless Shelters, Group Homes, Treatment/Rehabilitation Facilities, etc.);

(e) all EFAP food must be properly and securely stored; it cannot be stored, prepared or distributed from a private home, apartment or other personal residence;

(f) the provider must agree to submit a monthly service report which records the number of individuals served per month.

(g) EFAP food and/or funds cannot be used to supplant funds provided through any government contract to provide meals to a specific population (i.e.: Senior Centers or nonresidential treatment programs with government contracts to provide meals).

(h) the provider shall not require attendance at any religious service or other program activity as a prerequisite for receiving emergency food.






*§ 4-03 [Certification Requirements.]* ::


A food provider must be certified by the Administration. Certification requirements include:

(a) completion of the EFAP Application Form;

(b) satisfaction of the requirements of 68 RCNY § 4-02 above;

(c) receipt of a site visit by an Administration employee. An Annual recertification visit is also required.

(d) signing an agreement to abide by all EFAP requirements.






*§ 4-04 [Food Allocation and Administrative Funds, Biannual Review.]* ::


Each food provider's food allocation and administrative funds shall be determined two times per year.






*§ 4-05 [Food Budget.]* ::


The EFAP food budget will consist of two components: a food supplement and a meal budget.

 


.. list-table::
    :header-rows: 1

    * - EFAP Food Supplement
      - +
      - EFAP Meal Budget
      - =
      - Total EFAP Food Budget 
~



 

Correspondingly each provider's food allocation may consist of two components: a food supplement (discretionary) and a meal budget.

 


.. list-table::
    :header-rows: 1

    * - Food Supplement (Discretionary)
      - +
      - Meal Budget
      - =
      - A Provider's Food Allocation
~



 

(a) The EFAP food supplement per cycle shall be equal to no more than ten percent of the total EFAP Food Budget. A food supplement may be awarded to a provider based on the recommendations of the EFAP Advisory Group. These funds shall address needs that could not easily be factored into a set formula. It is envisioned that the funds shall be used to provide food money to: underserved communities by giving additional support to current EFAP providers to expand their service or to enable the Administration to recruit new service providers; programs providing services to special populations, e.g., immigrants and people with HIV; and, to fund special projects. The EFAP food supplement shall only be distributed to groups which meet the definition of "food provider" established in § 4.01 and which meet the eligibility criteria established in § 4.02.

(b) The EFAP meal budget wil be equal to the total EFAP food budget minus the EFAP food supplement.

 


.. list-table::
    :header-rows: 1

    * - Total EFAP Food Budget
      - -
      - EFAP Food Supplement
      - =
      - EFAP Meal Budget 
~



 

Each provider will receive a meal budget per cycle based on its number of funded meals. To arrive at a provider's meal budget, a series of calculations will be made. First, the total number of funded meals for all programs will be calculated by determining the number of meals served per program; determining the number of funded meals per program through the application of the sliding scale, as specified in paragraph (2) of this subdivision; and then adding together the number of funded meals for all programs. The sum of the funded meals for all programs will be divided into the EFAP meal budget yielding the dollar value of each funded meal.

 


.. list-table::
    :header-rows: 1

    * - EFAP Meal Budget
      - ÷
      - Total Number of Funded Meals for All Providers
      - =
      - Dollar Value of Each Funded Meal
~



 

Finally, the number of funded meals for a provider is multiplied by the dollar value of each funded meal providing the provider with its meal budget.

 


.. list-table::
    :header-rows: 1

    * - # of Funded Meals for Provider
      - ×
      - Dollar Value of Each Funded Meal
      - =
      - A Provider's Meal Budget
~



 

   (1) Food providers will continue to report the number of individuals served per month. The new formula will take into account that food pantries provide many meals per individual; while soup kitchens generally serve one meal per individual. The new formula will convert individuals served to meals served according to the following formulae:

 


.. list-table::
    :header-rows: 1

    * - The Total # of Individuals Served in each Soup Kitchen for Twelve Month Period
      - =
      - Total # of Meals Served in each Soup Kitchen for Twelve Month Period

      - ×
      - 3 Meals per Individual Served
      - =
      - Total # of Meals Served in Each Food Pantry for Twelve Month Period 
~



 

   (2) The number of meals served per provider will be weighted so that smaller providers receive more money per meal served, while at the same time the formula provides additional money for each meal served, albeit at a declining rate. All providers will be ranked according to the number of meals served during a twelve month period. Seven meal categories with minimum and maximum number of meals served will be established. The meal categories will be set as follows. First all providers will be sorted according to the total number of meals served within the twelve month period. The smallest ten percent of the providers will set the first category (i.e., the number of meals served by the provider that falls at the tenth percentile will be the maximum number of meals in the first category). The second category will begin with one more meal than the maximum number of meals for the first category. The upper limit of this category will be set at the number of meals served by the provider that falls at the twentieth percentile. The remaining five meal catgories will be set according to similar guidelines with the maximum number of meals included in each category being set at 30%, 80%, 87%, 94% and 100% respectively. The meals served by a provider are then multiplied by the appropriate meal factor for each category in order to determine the sum total of funded meals for each program. The following chart lists the percentage of programs within each meal category and the meal factor to be using in calculating the funded meals in each category.

One would determine the total number of funded meals for a provider serving 6,000 meals per year as follows:

 


.. list-table::
    :header-rows: 1

    * - 2,799 × 8 =
      - 22,392
    * - (4,999 - 2,800) × 4 =
      - 8,796
    * - (6,000 - 5,000) × 2 =
      - 2,000
    * -  
      - 33,188 funded meals
~



 

The total number of funded meals is then multiplied by the dollar value of each funded meal to determine a provider's meal budget.






*§ 4-06 [Allocation of Administrative Funds.]* ::


Each food provider shall be eligible to receive administrative funds to be used to cover approved operating expenses. Administrative funds shall be allocated in a way that takes into account the fact that soup kitchens generally have greater operating expenses than food pantries. Administrative funds for each food provider shall be allocated by using their dollars budgeted in the EFAP administrative line. Soup kitchens shall be eligible for twice as much administrative funding as food pantries due to significantly higher non-food costs associated with congregate meal preparation.






*§ 4-07 [Modifications.]* ::


The amount of food and administrative funds allocated to each provider may be changed by the Human Resources Administration for any allocation period, regardless of the above formulae, based on various factors, including, but not limited to:

(a) failure to submit monthly service reports;

(b) submission of inaccurate monthly service reports;

(c) a change in the provider's status from active to on-hold or closed;

(d) a request from the provider that its allocation be reduced.

(e) other factors dictating the need to reallocate funds, including, but not limited to changing demographics or changed demographic projections, or geographic im- balances.

Additionally, for a cardholder under 14 years of age, the cardholder’s designated emergency contact information will appear on the card.

(c) Only original documents or copies of documents that have been certified by the original issuing agency will be accepted. Data or electronic versions of documents received from the issuing agency may be deemed to constitute an original document if HRA determines in its discretion that the data have sufficient indicia of reliability. Documents with any alterations or erasures, or that are cancelled or invalidated, will not be accepted. IDNYC reserves the right to not accept any document, or type of document, whose validity it is not able to verify and, where relying on data or electronic versions of documents, to request additional information from the applicant.

(d) Except as provided in 68 RCNY § 6-06(a), all documents used to establish identity and residency must include the name of the individual whose identity and residency is being established. If any of the documents used to establish identity and residency bear a name that is not consistent with the one on the IDNYC application, the applicant must also present either a court order, a certificate of marriage or divorce, or another government-issued document that establishes a lawful name change.

(e) Applicants must present documents in person at an enrollment site designated by HRA in accordance with § 3-115(b)(2) of the Administrative Code of the City of New York.

IDNYC will not make copies of or digitally scan any documents used by applicants to establish identity or residency.

(f) Wherever a photo identification is required, the photo must bear a reasonable likeness to the person whose identity is being established. The person's gender identity or gender expression will not be the basis for rejection of a photo.

(g) Except for students who are applying for an IDNYC Card at a participating middle school pursuant to 68 RCNY § 6-04(e), applicants ages ten to thirteen years of age must be accompanied at enrollment by a caretaker who must sign the application on behalf of the applicant. Students applying for a card pursuant to 68 RCNY § 6-04(e) need not be accompanied by a caretaker, but will be required to submit an application signed by their parent as defined in Chancellor’s Regulation Number A-820.

Such information will be worth three points toward establishing the identity of the applicant if an original photo and related demographic data, including full name and date of birth, are available in DSS's systems; or one point toward establishing identity if only the name and date of birth, but no photo, are available in DSS's system; and one point towards establishing residency if the applicant's address is also in DSS's system.

   (2) Except as provided in paragraph (3) of this subdivision, the household's monthly contribution and LINC III rental assistance amount shall be calculated as follows:

      (A) Except as provided in subparagraph (C) of this paragraph, and provided the household remains eligible for LINC III rental assistance, the LINC III rental assistance amount shall be the household's actual rent less the sum of (i) any contributions required to be made in accordance with the provisions of subparagraph (E) of this paragraph and (ii) the standard Public Assistance shelter allowance as set forth in Section 352.3(a)(1) of Title 18 of the New York Codes, Rules and Regulations for the number of members in the household active for Public Assistance, provided that the LINC III rental assistance amount shall not exceed the maximum rental assistance amount for the household size as set forth in paragraph (1) of this subdivision. If the actual rent exceeds the sum of the LINC III rental assistance amount and the standard shelter allowance, the household shall pay directly to the landlord the amount that the actual rent exceeds such sum.

      (B) If a household in receipt of LINC III rental assistance receives a Public Assistance shelter allowance less than the standard Public Assistance shelter allowance set forth in Section 352.3(a)(1) of Title 18 of the New York Codes, Rules and Regulations, the household shall pay directly to the landlord the difference between the standard Public Assistance shelter amount and the Public Assistance shelter amount that the household receives.

      (C) If the household's Public Assistance shelter allowance is reduced pursuant to New York Social Services Law § 342, the LINC III rental assistance amount will be reduced using the same rule applied to reduce the Public Assistance benefits. The household shall pay any reduction amounts directly to the landlord.

      (D) If a household is in receipt of the LINC III rental assistance amount and such household's monthly rent obligation increases above the 2014 New York City Housing Authority Section 8 Voucher Payment Standards for the same type of unit after the household's second year in the LINC III rental assistance program, the household shall pay the amount of the rent increase directly to the landlord. In the event of such a rent increase, HRA may make exceptions to the maximum rental assistance amount on a case-by-case basis.

      (E) A member of the household who is not in receipt of Public Assistance and who receives income, earned or unearned, must contribute a pro rata share of the rent or thirty percent of his or her gross income, whichever is less, towards rent. If a member of the household is not currently in receipt of Public Assistance, but does not acknowledge receipt of income, earned or unearned, such household member must apply for Public Assistance before the household can be certified for LINC III rental assistance. If such household member is rejected as ineligible, such household member shall be subject to the contribution requirement set forth in this subparagraph. Nothing in this paragraph shall be construed to require a person ineligible for Public Assistance on the basis of his or her immigration status to apply for Public Assistance. An individual contributing a pro rata share of rent or thirty percent of his or her gross income shall not be counted for purposes of determining the LINC III maximum rental assistance amount as set forth in paragraph (1) of this subdivision, provided that the household's maximum rent shall be equal to the sum of the maximum rent for the household when such person is not counted and such person's required contribution, and provided further that the maximum rent shall not exceed the maximum rent for the household if such person were counted under paragraph (1) of this subdivision. Such individual's contribution shall be deducted from the household's actual rent for the purposes of determining the LINC III rental assistance amount as set forth in subparagraph (A) of this paragraph.

      (F) When an individual ineligible for Public Assistance on the basis of his or her immigration status has income that must be taken into consideration in calculating Public Assistance pursuant to New York Social Services Law § 131-a, such individual shall be included in the household for purposes of determining the maximum rent as set forth in paragraph (1) of this subdivision. Such individual shall not be included in the household for purposes of determining the maximum rental assistance amount as set forth in paragraph (1) of this subdivision and will not be subject to the contribution requirement as set forth in subparagraph (E) of this paragraph.

      (G) A LINC III rental assistance amount and any contributions required by subparagraph (E) of this paragraph shall be increased or reduced as a result of changes in a household's income, composition, or rent, provided that such increased or decreased rental assistance amount and contributions are calculated in accordance with the provisions of this subdivision. LINC III recipients shall promptly inform HRA of changes in income, household composition, or rent that may require an increase or decrease in the LINC III rental assistance amount and/or any required contributions. LINC III recipients will receive a notice from the City of New York of any change in their LINC III rental assistance amount and required contributions.

      (H) HRA shall pay the monthly rental assistance amount directly to the landlord each month for so long as the program participant's household remains eligible and funding for the program remains available, except that HRA may in its discretion pay one year of rental assistance payments in advance to a landlord who has entered into a lease with a program participant for a unit that was used as DHS shelter immediately prior to lease signing. Notwithstanding any inconsistent provisions of this section, (i) any such advance rental assistance payments shall be calculated based on the household size at the time of lease signing and (ii) if the household's rental assistance amount would otherwise have been reduced under this subdivision during the year in which rental assistance payments have been paid in advance, the household is required to pay the difference to HRA. If the household does not pay such difference to HRA during the year in which rental assistance payments have been paid in advance, HRA shall have the right to recover such difference from the household.

   (3) If a household in receipt of LINC III rental assistance has become ineligible for Public Assistance as a result of increased income or no longer includes a child who meets the criteria set forth in Section 369.2(c) of Title 18 of the New York Codes, Rules and Regulations or a pregnant woman, a program participant contribution of thirty percent of the household's total gross income, plus the amount of any increases in the rent permitted under paragraph (2) of subdivision (l) of 68 RCNY § 7-09 that are above the household's allowable rent as determined pursuant to paragraph (1) of this subdivision, will be required and will be paid by the household directly to the landlord each month. Such payments will be deducted from the monthly rent to determine the monthly rental assistance amount. The household's monthly program participant contribution and rental assistance amount will not change during the remainder of the household's current year in the program, regardless of changes in household composition or income and shall continue to be calculated in accordance with this paragraph for so long as the household remains eligible for the program even if the household later becomes eligible for Public Assistance or again includes a child who meets the criteria set forth in Section 369.2(c) of Title 18 of the New York Codes, Rules and Regulations.

Priority will be given to households whose Homeless Adult member or members have met the definition of Homeless Adult under paragraph (1), (2) or (3) of subdivision (b) of 68 RCNY § 7-10 for the longest period of time and to households whose Homeless Adult member or members meet the definition of a Homeless Adult under paragraph (4) of subdivision (b) of 68 RCNY § 7-10 and have been referred by HRA's Rental Assistance Unit or another City agency, with additional priority given to households that include the oldest Homeless Adults or medically frail Homeless Adults.

   (3) At the time of certification, HRA will calculate the household's monthly program participant contribution and the maximum monthly rental assistance amount pursuant to 68 RCNY § 7-14.

Except as provided in 68 RCNY § 7-15, the monthly program participant contribution and monthly rental assistance amount will not change during the one-year renewal period, regardless of changes in household composition or income.

   (3) HRA in its discretion may waive any of the requirements set forth in paragraph (1) of this subdivision on a case-by-case basis if the household's failure to meet the requirement was due to circumstances beyond the household's control, or where non-renewal is likely to result in the household's entry into shelter.

   (5) If a household has transferred to the LINC V program after being in receipt of LINC VI rental assistance, the time the household participated in the LINC VI program shall be considered time in the LINC V program for purposes of renewal. If the effective date of the first lease or rental agreement for the residence towards which LINC V rental assistance shall be applied is not more than ten months after the start of the household's current year of participation in the LINC VI program, then the household's current year of LINC rental assistance shall begin anew on the effective date of such lease or rental agreement. If the effective date of the first lease or rental agreement for the residence towards which LINC V rental assistance shall be applied is more than ten months after the start of the household's current year of participation in the LINC VI program, then the household's next year of LINC rental assistance shall begin on the effective date of such lease or rental agreement.

   (2) A program participant contribution of thirty percent of the household's total monthly gross income at the time of certification or renewal, plus the amount of any increases in the rent permitted under paragraph (2) of subdivision (l) of 68 RCNY § 7-17 that are above the household's allowable rent as determined pursuant to paragraph (1) of this subdivision, will be required and will be paid by the household directly to the landlord each month. Such payments will be deducted from the monthly rent to determine the monthly rental assistance amount. HRA shall pay the monthly rental assistance amount directly to the landlord each month for so long as the program participant's household remains eligible and funding for the program remains available, except that HRA may in its discretion pay one year of rental assistance payments in advance to a landlord who has entered into a lease with a program participant for a unit that was used as DHS shelter immediately prior to lease signing.

(b) Room Rentals.

   (1) Where a household certified to receive or receiving LINC IV or LINC V rental assistance enters into a rental agreement for a single room with a landlord or a primary tenant, the monthly rent of such single room must not exceed $800, except that HRA may make exceptions on a case-by-case basis if the rent is reasonable in relation to current rents for comparable units in the private unassisted market. It is further provided that:

      (A) Where the rental agreement is with a primary tenant who receives Public Assistance, the household's monthly rent cannot exceed the difference between the primary tenant's rent obligation to the landlord and the primary tenant's shelter allowance under Section 352.3 of Title 18 of the New York Codes, Rules and Regulations at the time of the effective date of the rental agreement; and

      (B) In no event shall the household's monthly rent exceed the household's proportionate share of the rent for the entire residence. The determination of what constitutes the household's proportionate share of the rent shall be based on the formula set forth in Section 2525.7 of Title 9 of the New York Code of Rules and Regulations or a comparable measure.

   (2) A program participant contribution of thirty percent of the household's total gross income at the time of certification will be required and will be paid by the household directly to the landlord or primary tenant, as applicable, each month. The program participant contribution will be deducted from the household's monthly rent to determine the monthly rental assistance amount. HRA shall pay the monthly rental assistance amount directly to the landlord or the primary tenant, as applicable, each month for so long as the program participant's household remains eligible and funding for the program remains available.








*§ 7-15 Moves.* ::


(a) A household receiving LINC IV or LINC V rental assistance may not move to a new residence and maintain eligibility for LINC rental assistance except with the approval of HRA. The program participant must obtain such approval prior to moving to a new residence, provided that HRA may consider a request for approval made after the move if a program participant is unable to obtain such approval prior to the move due to circumstances beyond the program participant's control.

(b) HRA shall grant approval for a move if the household is moving from a room to an apartment, unless the program participant is breaking a lease for the room, in which case the program participant must establish either good cause for the move or that the landlord is willing to release the household from the lease. In all other situations, HRA shall grant approval for a move from one residence to another residence only upon a showing by the program participant that there is good cause for the move. If the requested move is to a residence with a higher rent than the rent for the current residence, approval will also be subject to the availability of funding.

(c) If HRA has approved a move to a new residence, HRA shall recalculate the monthly program participant contribution and monthly rental assistance amount and those amounts shall not change for one year from the effective date of the lease or other rental agreement for the new residence, regardless of changes in income or household composition. If the effective date of the lease or rental agreement for the new residence is not more than ten months after the start of the household's current year of participation in the program, then the household's current year of LINC rental assistance shall begin anew on the effective date of such lease or rental agreement. If the effective date of the lease or rental agreement for the new residence is more than ten months after the start of the household's current year of participation in the program and the household is eligible for renewal of LINC assistance, then the household's renewal period shall begin on the effective date of such lease or rental agreement.

An employee of such attorney will be considered an authorized representative if such employee presents written authorization from the attorney or if such attorney advises HRA by telephone of such employee's authorization.

   (2) Once HRA has been notified that a person or organization has been authorized to represent a Homeless Adult or LINC IV or LINC V program participant at an agency review conference or administrative hearing, such representative will receive copies of all correspondence sent by HRA to the Homeless Adult or program participant relating to the conference and hearing.

(b) Except as provided in subdivision (h) of this section, for the purposes of subdivision (a) of this section, the household size equals the number of household members in receipt of Public Assistance. 

(c) Except as provided in subdivisions (e) and (f) of this section, and provided the household remains eligible for a CITYFEPS rent supplement, the CITYFEPS rent supplement amount shall be the household's actual rent less the sum of (1) any contributions required to be made in accordance with the provisions of subdivision (g) of this section, and (2) the standard Public Assistance shelter allowance as set forth in Section 352.3(a)(1) of Title 18 of the New York Codes, Rules and Regulations for the number of members in the household in receipt of Public Assistance, provided that the CITYFEPS rent supplement amount shall not exceed the maximum CITYFEPS rent supplement amount for the household size as set forth in subdivision (a) of this section. If the actual rent exceeds the sum of the CITYFEPS rent supplement amount and the standard Public Assistance shelter allowance, the household shall pay directly to the landlord the amount that the actual rent exceeds such sum. 

(d) If a household in receipt of a CITYFEPS rent supplement receives a Public Assistance shelter allowance less than the standard Public Assistance shelter allowance set forth in Section 352.3(a)(1) of Title 18 of the New York Codes, Rules and Regulations, the household shall pay directly to the landlord the difference between the standard Public Assistance shelter allowance amount and the Public Assistance shelter allowance amount that the household receives. 

(e) If the household's Public Assistance benefits are reduced pursuant to New York Social Services Law § 342, the CITYFEPS rent supplement amount will be reduced using the same rule applied to reduce the Public Assistance benefits. The CITYFEPS rent supplement amount will be so reduced for the duration of the Public Assistance benefits reduction and shall be reinstated at the expiration of the Public Assistance benefits reduction. The household shall pay any reduction amounts directly to the landlord. 

(f) If a household is in receipt of the maximum CITYFEPS rent supplement amount and the household's monthly rent obligation increases above the applicable maximum rent set forth in subdivision (a) of this section, the household shall pay the amount of the rent increase directly to the landlord. In the event of such a rent increase, HRA may make exceptions to the maximum CITYFEPS rent supplement amount on a case-by-case basis 

(g) A member of the household who is not in receipt of Public Assistance and who receives income, earned or unearned, must contribute a pro rata share of the rent or thirty percent of his or her gross income, whichever is less, towards rent. A person ineligible for Public Assistance on the basis of his or her immigration status shall not be included in the household for purposes of determining the maximum rent or maximum CITYFEPS rent supplement amount as set forth in subdivision (a) of this section and will not be subject to the program participant contribution requirement as set forth in this subdivision. If the household contains an individual contributing a pro rata share of rent or thirty percent of his or her gross income, the household's maximum rent shall be equal to the lesser of: (1) the sum of the maximum rent for the household size as determined pursuant to subdivision (b) of this section and such individual's required contribution, or (2) the maximum rent for the household if the household size were increased by one. Such individual's contribution shall be deducted from the household's actual rent for the purposes of determining the CITYFEPS rent supplement amount as set forth in subdivision (c) of this section. 

(h) When an individual ineligible for Public Assistance on the basis of his or her immigration status has income that must be taken into consideration in calculating Public Assistance pursuant to New York Social Services Law § 131-a, such individual shall be included in the household for purposes of determining the maximum rent but shall not be included in the household for purposes of determining the maximum CITYFEPS rent supplement amount as set forth in subdivision (a) of this section and will not be subject to the program participant contribution requirement set forth in subdivision (g) of this section. 

(i) A CITYFEPS rent supplement amount and any contributions required by subdivision (g) of this section shall be increased or decreased as a result of changes in a household's income, composition, or rent, provided that such increased or decreased rent supplement amount and contributions are calculated in accordance with the provisions of this section. Program participants shall promptly inform HRA of changes in income, household composition, or rent. Program participants will receive a notice from HRA of any change in their CITYFEPS rent supplement amount and required contributions. 

(j) HRA shall pay the CITYFEPS rent supplement directly to the landlord each month for so long as the program participant's household remains eligible and funding for the program remains available, except that HRA may in its discretion pay one year of rent supplement payments in advance to a landlord who has entered into a lease with a program participant for a unit that was used as DHS shelter immediately prior to lease signing. Notwithstanding any inconsistent provisions of this section, (i) any such advance rent supplement payments shall be calculated based on the household size at the time of lease signing and (ii) if the household's rent supplement amount would otherwise have been reduced under this section during the year in which rent supplement payments have been paid in advance, the household is required to pay the difference to HRA. If the household does not pay such difference to HRA during the year in which rent supplement payments have been paid in advance, HRA shall have the right to recover such difference from the household. 

(k) Notwithstanding any inconsistent provision of this section, if HRA determines that due to current market conditions, it is unlikely that households consisting of five or more individuals will be able to secure housing within the next 90 days at the rents otherwise permitted under this section, HRA may in its discretion increase the maximum rent towards which CITYFEPS rent supplements may be applied pursuant to subdivision (a) of this section to up to 130 percent of the 2014 New York City Housing Authority Section 8 Voucher Payment Standards for units for the household size.

   (1) The new monthly rent obligation does not exceed the maximum rent for the household's size under subdivision (a) of 68 RCNY § 8-05
										 and is protected from increases for at least one year except as authorized under rent stabilization laws and rules or HUD regulations; and 

   (2) The need for the move is a direct result of: (A) the household's inability to pay required contributions pursuant to subdivision (g) of 68 RCNY § 8-05
										 due to changes in the household's income, composition or rent obligations; (B) a vacate order issued by a City agency or court; or (C) a documented health and safety concern or other good cause, as determined by HRA on a case-by-case basis. 

(b) If HRA has approved a move to a new residence, HRA shall recalculate the monthly CITYFEPS rent supplement amount and program participant contribution pursuant to 68 RCNY § 8-05

   (2) A program participant contribution of thirty percent of the household's total gross income at the time of approval or renewal plus any amount by which the rent after the first year exceeds the maximum rent for the household's size as set forth in paragraph (1) of this subdivision is required and will be paid by the program participant directly to the landlord each month. Such payments will be deducted from the monthly rent to determine the monthly rent supplement. HRA shall pay the monthly rent supplement amount directly to the landlord each month as long as the household remains eligible and funding for the program remains available, except that HRA may in its discretion pay one year of rent supplement payments in advance to a landlord who has entered into a lease with a program participant for a unit that was used as a shelter unit operated by or on behalf of DHS immediately prior to lease signing. Any such advance rent supplement payments shall be calculated based on the household size at the time of lease signing. If the household's rent supplement amount would otherwise have been reduced under this section during the year in which rent supplement payments have been paid in advance, the household shall pay the difference to HRA. If the household does not pay the difference to HRA during the year in which rent supplement payments have been paid in advance, HRA has the right to recover such difference from the household.

   (3) If HRA determines that due to current market conditions, it is unlikely that households consisting of five or more individuals will be able to secure housing within the next ninety days at the rents permitted under paragraph (1) of this subdivision, HRA may in its discretion increase the maximum rent towards which SEPS rent supplements may be applied pursuant to such paragraph to up to 130 percent of the 2014 New York City Housing Authority Section 8 Voucher Payment Standards for units for the household size.

(b) Room Rentals.

   (1) The maximum monthly rent for a single room towards which a SEPS rent supplement may be applied must not exceed $800 during the first year, except that HRA may make exceptions on a case-by-case basis if the rent is reasonable in relation to current rents for comparable units in the private unassisted market. It is further provided that:

      (A) Where the rental agreement is with a primary tenant who receives Public Assistance, the household's monthly rent cannot exceed the difference between the primary tenant's rent obligation to the landlord and the primary tenant's shelter allowance under Section 352.3 of Title 18 of the New York Codes, Rules and Regulations at the time of the effective date of the rental agreement; and

      (B) In no event shall the household's monthly rent exceed the household's proportionate share of the rent for the entire residence. The determination of what constitutes the participant's proportionate share of the rent shall be based on the formula set forth in Section 2525.7 of Title 9 of the New York Code of Rules and Regulations or a comparable measure.

   (2) A program participant contribution of (a) thirty percent of the household's total monthly gross income at the time of approval or renewal plus (b) any amount by which the rent after the first year exceeds $800 shall be paid by the program participant directly to the landlord or primary tenant, as applicable, each month. The program participant contribution will be deducted from the household's monthly rent or $800, whichever is less, to determine the monthly rent supplement. HRA shall pay the monthly rent supplement directly to the landlord or the primary tenant, as applicable, each month for so long as the program participant remains eligible and funding for the program remains available.








*§ 8-14 Moves.* ::


(a) A household participating in the SEPS Program may not move to a new residence and maintain eligibility for the SEPS Program except with the approval of HRA. The household must obtain such approval prior to moving to a new residence, provided that HRA may consider a request for approval made after the move if a household is unable to obtain such approval prior to the move due to circumstances beyond the household's control.

(b) HRA shall grant approval for a move if the household is moving from a room to an apartment, unless the household is breaking a lease for the room, in which case the household must establish either good cause for the move or that the landlord is willing to release the program participant from the lease. In all other situations, HRA shall grant approval for a move from one residence to another residence only upon a showing by the household that there is good cause for the move. If the requested move is to a residence with a higher rent than the rent for the current residence, approval will also be subject to the availability of funding.

(c) If HRA has approved a move to a new residence, HRA shall recalculate the monthly program participant contribution and monthly rent supplement and those amounts shall not change for one year from the effective date of the rental agreement for the new residence, regardless of changes in income or household composition. If the effective date of the rental agreement for the new residence is not more than ten months after the start of the household's current year of participation in the program, then the household's current year in the SEPS Program shall begin anew on the effective date of such rental agreement. If the effective date of the rental agreement for the new residence is more than ten months after the start of the household's current year in the program and the household is eligible for renewal in the SEPS Program, then the household's renewal period shall begin on the effective date of such rental agreement.

   (2) For purposes of determining unit size:

      (A) The household consists of all individuals who intend to reside in the assisted unit;

      (B) In the case of documented pregnancy by a household member, the unborn child is counted as a household member;

      (C) Any live-in aide approved by HRA to reside in the assisted unit to care for a household member who is disabled or 62 years of age or over is counted as a household member;

      (D) A child who resides in the assisted unit with his or her parent for at least 183 days of the year pursuant to a joint custody agreement or order is counted as a household member, provided that such parent is a household member;

      (E) A foster child who is placed and resides in the assisted unit for more than 183 days of the year is counted as a household member; and

      (F) Except as otherwise provided in this paragraph, an individual who is absent from the assisted unit for more than 90 consecutive days will not be counted as a household member unless such individual is absent due to hospitalization, military deployment, or other good cause as determined by HRA on a case-by-case basis, and is reasonably expected to return within 180 days. A household member who is away at school but intends to live with the household in the assisted unit during school recesses is considered a household member.

   (3) If a household includes a household member with a disability, HRA may assign the household a higher unit size as a reasonable accommodation for such member.

   (4) The household may lease an otherwise acceptable unit with fewer bedrooms than the assigned unit size provided the unit meets the applicable HQS space requirements.

   (5) The household may lease an otherwise acceptable unit with more bedrooms than the assigned unit size.

(b) Rent Standard Amount.

   (1) The HRA HOME TBRA rent standard amount shall be based on unit size. HRA shall set the HRA HOME TBRA rent standard amount for each unit size at an amount that is between 95 and 110 percent of the fair market rent applicable in New York City for the unit size as published annually by HUD pursuant to Part 888 of Title 24 of the Code of Federal Regulations. HRA shall publish current HRA HOME TBRA rent standard amounts on HRA's website.

   (2) A household's rent standard amount shall be the HRA HOME TBRA rent standard amount established pursuant to paragraph (1) of this subdivision for the household's assigned unit size.

   (3) For the initial occupancy of an assisted unit, the household's gross rent, including heat and hot water, shall not exceed the household's rent standard amount. Following the household's first year in the unit, the household's rent may exceed the applicable rent standard amount so long as the rent is reasonable pursuant to standards set forth in Section 982.507 of Title 24 of the Code of Federal Regulations.

(c) The HRA HOME TBRA rental assistance amount paid on behalf of a household shall equal the household's gross rent minus the total household contribution calculated pursuant to subdivision (d) of this section.

(d) Income Contribution and Household Share of Rent.

   (1) The household's total monthly household contribution to rent shall be the sum of the following:

      (A) The highest of the following amounts, rounded to the nearest dollar:

         (i) The household's adjusted income multiplied by 30 percent and divided by 12;

         (ii) The household's annual income multiplied by 10 percent and divided by 12;

         (iii) The amount of the household's public assistance shelter allowance as calculated and received pursuant to Section 352.3 of Title 18 of the New York Codes, Rules and Regulations; or 

         (iv) Fifty dollars, which may be reduced based on financial hardship at HRA's discretion;

      (B) The amount, if any, by which the rent exceeds the applicable rent standard amount established pursuant to subdivision (b) of 68 RCNY §9-08, after the household's first year in the assisted unit; and

      (C) The amount, if any, by which the HRA HOME TBRA rental assistance amount has been reduced pursuant to subdivision (e) of this section.

(e) If a household includes a member who is ineligible for HRA HOME TBRA on the basis of immigration status in accordance with Section 1436a of Title 42 of the United States Code, the household's HRA HOME TBRA rental assistance amount will be prorated by multiplying the HRA HOME TBRA rental assistance amount as calculated in subdivision (c) of this section by a fraction, the denominator of which is the total number of household members and the numerator of which is the total number of household members who are not ineligible for HRA HOME TBRA on the basis of immigration status.

(f) Change in the HRA HOME TBRA Rent Standard Amount during the Coupon Term and Prior to Execution of the Rental Assistance Contract.

   If the HRA HOME TBRA rent standard amount for the household's assigned unit size is increased or decreased during the term of the coupon and prior to the execution of the Rental Assistance Contract, the new rent standard amount shall be used to calculate the HRA HOME TBRA rental assistance amount for the household.

(g) Change in the HRA HOME TBRA Rent Standard Amount During the Rental Assistance Contract Term.

   (1) If the HRA HOME TBRA rent standard amount for the household's assigned unit size is increased during the term of the Rental Assistance Contract, the increased rent standard amount shall be used to calculate the HRA HOME TBRA rental assistance amount for the household beginning on the effective date of the household's next annual recertification on or after the effective date of the increase in the rent standard amount.

   (2) A decrease in the HRA HOME TBRA rent standard will not be applied to a household during the Rental Assistance Contract term and the household's rent standard amount will remain the same for purposes of calculating the HRA HOME TBRA rental assistance amount at the household's next annual recertification.

Except in emergency situations, HRA will provide reasonable notice of any inspection and a reasonable opportunity for the landlord and household to reschedule an inspection.

*§ 9-11 Household Separations.* ::


(a) If an applicant household separates into two or more otherwise eligible applicant household units prior to executing a Rental Assistance Contract, HRA will decide on a case-by-case basis which of the household units will be considered the applicant household and remain eligible to receive HRA HOME TBRA rental assistance. If a household receiving HRA HOME TBRA rental assistance separates, HRA will decide on a case-by-case basis which of the household units will continue to receive such assistance. In the event of a household separation, under no circumstances shall more than one of the resulting household units receive HRA HOME TBRA rental assistance.

(b) In determining pursuant to subdivision (a) of this section which resulting household unit shall remain eligible for or participate in HRA HOME TBRA, consideration will be given to factors including but not limited to:

   (1) which household member was designated as head of household on the application for HRA HOME TBRA rental assistance;

For purposes of this subdivision and calculating the CityFHEPS rental assistance payment amount, a household of one who has transferred from LINC IV to CityFHEPS will be treated as a household of two.

(b) The base program participant contribution is calculated as follows:

   (1) Where no members of the household receive PA, the base program participant contribution is 30 percent of the household's total monthly gross income at the time of approval or renewal. However, if at renewal, or at the time of a recalculation of the supplement amount, pursuant to paragraphs (a) or (b) of 68 RCNY § 10-09, the household reports no income, the base program participant contribution will equal the maximum shelter allowance for the household size.

(c) Except as provided in 68 RCNY § 10-09, the CityFHEPS rental assistance payments will not change until renewal, regardless of changes in household composition, income, the maximum monthly rent, or the actual rent for the CityFHEPS unit.

(d) Upon approval of a CityFHEPS unit, HRA shall pay to the landlord the first month's rent in full and the CityFHEPS rental assistance payments for the next three months. Thereafter, HRA shall pay the CityFHEPS rental assistance payments directly to the landlord each month as long as the household remains eligible and funding for the program remains available, except that HRA may in its discretion pay additional months of CityFHEPS rental assistance payments in advance where needed to address the goals set forth in the plan entitled Turning the Tide on Homelessness in New York City.

(b) Except as provided in 68 RCNY § 10-09, the CityFHEPS rental assistance payments will not change until renewal, regardless of changes in household composition, income, the maximum monthly rents, or the actual rent for the CityFHEPS unit.

However, if the CityFHEPS rental assistance payments begin ten months or more after the start of the household's current year of participation in CITYFEPS, LINC VI or Pathway Home, then the household's current year of participation in such programs shall be counted as a full year.

(f) The Commissioner will determine a household's eligibility for renewal at the end of each year of the household's participation in the program, subject to the availability of funding. Prior to annual renewal, the Commissioner will recalculate the household's CityFHEPS rental assistance payments, pursuant to 68 RCNY § 10-06 or 68 RCNY § 10-07, as applicable.

(b) In the event that the household's shelter allowance increases prior to renewal, such that the sum of the CityFHEPS rental assistance payment and the shelter allowance exceeds the household's actual or maximum rent, whichever is less, HRA shall reduce the CityFHEPS rental assistance amount so that it equals the difference between the household's shelter allowance and the lesser of the actual or maximum rent.

(c) The Commissioner may discontinue CityFHEPS rental assistance payments if:

   (1) the household leaves the CityFHEPS unit;

   (2) the landlord fails to comply with requirements set forth at 68 RCNY § 10-14, whereupon the household may be granted approval to move, pursuant to 68 RCNY § 10-10; or
