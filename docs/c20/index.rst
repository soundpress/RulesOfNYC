Appeals that are unsworn by the applicant or submitted by individuals or business entities other than the applicant or her/his New York State licensed attorney shall not be accepted.

*§ 1-04 Licenses and Licensees.* ::


(a) For purposes of this section, all employees of a licensed dealer in rifles and shotguns shall personally be in possession of a valid rifle/shotgun permit to purchase and possess rifles and shotguns issued by the Rifle/Shotgun Section. Applications for dealer in rifles and shotguns and for possession of rifles and/or shotguns shall be processed together if submitted together.

(b) A dealer's license shall be valid for one year and may be renewed under the same conditions as for original issuance. All licensees shall be held responsible for renewing their licenses upon expiration. Any application to renew a license that has not previously expired, been revoked, suspended or cancelled shall thereby extend the term of the license until disposition is made of the application. Failure to renew a license after expiration shall result in the cancellation of the license.

(c) Federal law requires that dealers in rifles and shotguns shall be licensed by the United States Government Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms (ATF). The New York City Police Department shall notify the ATF of all dealer's licenses that are issued by the Rifle/Shotgun Section. The Police Department reserves the right to withhold a dealer's license from any applicant who does not have a federal license.

(d) All licensees shall be required to sign an acknowledgment that they shall be responsible for compliance with all laws, rules, regulations, standards, and procedures promulgated by federal, state, or local jurisdictions, and by federal, state, or local law enforcement agencies, that are applicable to each type of license or permit issued to them. The Rifle/Shotgun Section shall provide the licensee with the acknowledgment statement to be executed. This acknowledgment statement shall be notarized. Failure to execute the acknowledgment statement and to have it notarized shall result in the license application being denied.

(e) The licensee shall immediately notify the Rifle/Shotgun Section by telephone, followed by written notice within ten (10) calendar days, of any incident or violation of law or rules of federal, state, or local jurisdictions regarding her/himself, partners, officers, directors or stockholders of the licensed corporation or entity, or affecting the premises or business operations. For purposes of this subdivision, an incident includes:

   (1) arrest, indictment or conviction in any jurisdiction;

   (2) summons (except traffic infraction);

   (3) suspension or ineligibility order issued pursuant to § 530.14 of the New York State Criminal Procedure Law or § 842-a of the New York State Family Court Act;

   (4) the fact that the individual is or becomes the subject or recipient of an order of protection or a temporary order of protection;

   (5) admission to any psychiatric institution, sanitarium and/or the receipt of psychiatric treatment;

   (6) receipt of treatment for alcoholism or drug abuse;

   (7) the presence or occurrence of a disability or condition that may affect the handling of a rifle/shotgun, including but not limited to epilepsy, diabetes, fainting spells, blackouts, temporary loss of memory, or nervous disorder;

   (8) altered or mutilated license; or

   (9) discharge of a rifle/shotgun on the licensee's premises.

(f) A dealer's license may be suspended and/or revoked by the Rifle/Shotgun Section for good cause by the issuance of a Notice of Determination Letter to the licensee, which shall state in brief the grounds for the suspension or revocation and notify the licensee of the opportunity for a hearing. The conviction of a licensee anywhere of a felony or serious offense as defined in § 265.00(17) of the Penal Law of New York State, or of a misdemeanor crime of domestic violence as defined in § 921(a) of title 18, United States Code, shall operate as a revocation of the license.

(g) If her/his license is suspended or revoked, the licensee shall be required to deposit any rifles or shotguns as well as any handgun license and any handguns in her/his possession with her/his local police precinct and forward a copy of the voucher together with her/his permit to the Rifle/Shotgun Section, 120-55 Queens Boulevard, Kew Gardens, N.Y. 11424, Room B-11. Her/his failure to comply within ten (10) calendar days from the date of suspension or revocation may result in the arrest of the licensee.

(h) A license issued shall be valid only for the premises mentioned and described in the license. No license is transferable to another person or location. The license shall be prominently displayed on such premises, and available at all times for inspection by members of the New York City Police Department. Failure of any licensee to so exhibit or display her/his license shall be presumptive evidence that s/he is not duly licensed.

(i) Upon issuance of a written Notice of Determination Letter from the Rifle/Shotgun Section notifying the licensee of suspension or of revocation of the license, a suspended/former licensee shall have thirty (30) calendar days from the date of the notice to submit a written request for a hearing to the Commanding Officer, License Division, One Police Plaza, Room 110A, New York, New York 10038. A licensee whose arrest or summons resulted in suspension or revocation of her/his license may only submit a written request or a hearing within thirty (30) calendar days after the termination of the criminal action, as defined in New York State Criminal Procedure Law § 1.20(16)(c). If the suspension or revocation resulted from the licensee becoming the subject of an order of protection or a temporary order of protection, the licensee may only submit a written request for a hearing within thirty (30) calendar days after the expiration or voiding of the order of protection or temporary order of protection. If the suspension or revocation was related to both a criminal action and an order of protection or temporary order of protection, then the later of the two waiting periods shall apply.

(j) Licensees shall be held responsible for having knowledge of all new laws and/or amendments or regulations that may be enacted through legislation or promulgated by the New York City Police Department affecting dealers in rifles and shotguns.

(k) Licensees shall cooperate with all reasonable requests by the Police Department for information and assistance in matters relating to the license.






*§ 1-05 Rifles/Shotguns and Ammunition.* ::


(a) No rifle or shotgun shall be sold, or given away, or disposed of, unless the transferee is authorized by law to possess such rifle or shotgun. Any police officer or peace officer shall produce a shield and proper identification before purchasing a rifle or shotgun. A peace officer whose status does not confer authorization to possess firearms pursuant to § 2.10 of the New York State Criminal Procedure Law shall possess a rifle/shotgun permit in order to be a lawful transferee. Therefore, before delivering a rifle or shotgun to a peace officer without a rifle/shotgun permit, the licensee shall verify that person's status as a peace officer by telephoning the License Division Incident Section at (212) 374-5538 or 5539.

(b) Every dealer in rifles and shotguns shall keep a record book provided by the Rifle/Shotgun Section (P.D. 641-50). This book shall contain a record of all dispositions and registrations of rifles and shotguns purchased and disposed of by the dealer. Such records shall be maintained on the premises stated in the license and permanently preserved thereat. In the event of cancellation and/or revocation of the license, or discontinuance of business by a licensee, such records, as well as rifles and shotguns stored on the premises, shall be surrendered to the New York City Police Department.

(c) In the event of loss or theft of any rifle or shotgun, ammunition, dealer's license, or record, the licensee is required to report the loss or theft to her/his local precinct, and notify the Rifle/Shotgun Section by telephone on the next business day after discovery of the loss or theft. The licensee shall follow up with a written notification to the Rifle/Shotgun Section within 10 calendar days of discovery of the loss or theft.

(d) In the event that any individual lacking authority to possess such weapon attempts to leave any rifle or shotgun with a licensee for cleaning, repairing, or other processing, the licensee may accept the rifle or shotgun and obtain the name, address, telephone number, etc. of the person leaving the weapon. The licensee shall immediately report the incident to the precinct wherein the premises is located. If the licensee does not accept the rifle or shotgun for cleaning, repairing, or other processing, s/he shall report the incident to the precinct wherein the premises is located as soon as the individual possessing the weapon leaves the premises. In the event that such an individual offers to sell or otherwise dispose of such a weapon to a licensee, the licensee shall attempt to obtain the name, address, and telephone number of said individual and shall notify the precinct wherein the premises is located as soon as said individual leaves the premises.

(e) Any dealer who sells, offers to sell, stores, or otherwise disposes of ammunition in excess of two hundred (200) cartridges shall be required to obtain a storage permit from the Fire Commissioner. Dealer's licenses issued by the Rifle/Shotgun Section shall not be valid for the sale of ammunition unless the dealership is also in possession of a storage permit from the Fire Department. Upon receipt of an application which indicates an intention to sell or store ammunition, the Rifle/Shotgun Section shall notify the Fire Department and ask them to conduct an inspection of the premises. The sale or storage of ammunition without a valid Fire Department permit shall be deemed sufficient cause to revoke a dealer's license.

(f) No ammunition shall be stored, exhibited, or displayed in the windows, showcases, or doors of the licensee's premises.

(g) All other ammunition shall be stored in an area of the premises that can be reasonably secured, and is not in view of the public. Only the licensee and authorized employees shall have access to this storage area.

(h) (1) The quantities of cartridges and other ammunition stored on the premises shall not exceed the amounts fixed by the Fire Commissioner for storage of ammunition. These quantities so fixed shall be stated in the storage permit.

   (2) All ammunition kept on the licensee's premises shall not be stored in an area where other materials of a highly flammable nature are manufactured, stored, or kept for sale. This restriction shall not apply to any person duly authorized to keep and sell gunpowder.

(i) (1) A record of all ammunition received and dispensed shall be registered in a bound book with pages consecutively numbered. This record book shall be separately maintained from the record book noting all rifle and shotgun transactions. It shall be the responsibility of the licensee or a designated employee to make entries in this record book. This book, together with all invoices received, shall be kept in the ammunition storage area.

   (2) This record shall be arranged in columnar form as outlined below. The first page of this book shall have an inscription bearing the name and address of the premises, license number, name of owner of premises, name of employee designated to make entries, and date of book being opened. Beginning with page 2, each even numbered page shall contain a record of ammunition received, and starting with page 3, each odd numbered page shall contain a record of ammunition dispensed or sold.

(j) In the event of cancellation or revocation of the license or discontinuance of business by a licensee, such records shall be surrendered to the New York City Police Department.

(k) No ammunition suitable for use in a rifle of any calibre, or for a shotgun of any gauge, shall be sold, given away, or otherwise disposed of to any person who has not been issued a rifle/shotgun permit and a certificate of registration, and who does not exhibit the same to the dealer at the time of purchase. Rifle or shotgun ammunition shall not be sold to any such person except for the shotgun or for the specific calibre of rifle for which the certificate of registration has been issued.

(l) The Rifle/Shotgun Section advises all dealers that certain ammunition calibres are considered to be interchangeable between rifles and handguns.

 ** Records for ammunition received shall be placed on all even numbered pages beginning with page 2. ** Records for ammunition sold and disposed of shall be placed on all odd numbered pages beginning with page 3.

(m) Prospective buyers shall not be allowed to load weapons upon the premises of the licensee. If the sale of one or more rifles and/or shotguns as well as ammunition is consummated, the ammunition box shall be sealed prior to the sale and the buyer shall be instructed that the rifle or shotgun is not to be loaded on the premises.

(n) Pursuant to New York City Administrative Code § 10-312, it shall be a criminal violation for any person who is the lawful owner or lawful custodian of a rifle or shotgun to store or otherwise place or leave such weapon in such a manner or under circumstances that it is out of her/his immediate possession or control, without having rendered such weapon inoperable by employing a safety locking device as defined in subdivision (o) of this section. Such offense shall constitute a misdemeanor if the offender has previously been found guilty of such violation or if the violation is committed under circumstances which create a substantial risk of physical injury to another person. The New York City Police Department recognizes that all licensees have incurred an obligation by being issued a dealer's license to maintain and dispose of rifles and shotguns in a responsible fashion. In order to assist licensees, the Rifle/Shotgun Section has issued the following safety requirements in response to past incidents involving dealers in rifles and shotguns:

   (1) No weapons shall be stored, exhibited or displayed in windows, showcases, or doors of the premises. Rifle/shotgun storage or inventory areas shall be physically separated from counter and display areas and access to these areas shall be carefully controlled.

   (2) All rifle/shotgun display cases shall be kept locked and secured at all times and not readily accessible to the public. All keys to such display cases shall not leave the control of authorized personnel.

   (3) All rifles and shotguns shall not be readily capable of firing. They shall be temporarily deactivated by removing magazines or bolts; or by securing with bars or chains through the trigger guard; or by using individual trigger locks or other safety locking devices composed primarily of steel or other metal of significant gauge to inhibit breaking.

   (4) All rifles and shotguns within a licensee's inventory shall be tagged and cross referenced to the appropriate entry in the acquisition records.

(o) Pursuant to New York City Administrative Code § 10-311(a), it shall be unlawful for any person or business enterprise to dispose of any rifle or shotgun which does not contain a safety locking device, defined as a design adaptation or attachable accessory that will prevent the use of the weapon by an unauthorized user. The following types of safety locking devices will be deemed to comply with this provision:

   (1) a trigger lock, which prevents the pulling of the trigger without the use of a key; or

   (2) a combination handle, which prevents the use of the weapon without the alignment of the combination tumblers; or

   (3) a detachable or non-detachable locking device, composed primarily of steel or other metal of significant gauge to inhibit breaking, utilizing a metallic key or combination lock, rendering the weapon inoperable until the locking device is removed by an authorized person.

(p) Pursuant to New York City Administrative Code § 10-311(b), it shall be unlawful for any licensed manufacturer, licensed importer, or licensed dealer to dispose of any rifle or shotgun in New York City unless it is accompanied by the following warning, which shall appear in conspicuous and legible type in capital letters, and which shall be printed on a label affixed to the rifle or shotgun and on a separate sheet of paper included within the packaging enclosing the rifle or shotgun: "THE USE OF A LOCKING DEVICE OR SAFETY LOCK IS ONLY ONE ASPECT OF RESPONSIBLE WEAPON STORAGE. ALL WEAPONS SHOULD BE STORED UNLOADED AND LOCKED IN A LOCATION THAT IS BOTH SEPARATE FROM THEIR AMMUNITION AND INACCESSIBLE TO CHILDREN AND ANY OTHER UNAUTHORIZED PERSONS."

(q) Pursuant to New York City Administrative Code § 10-311(c), any person who applies for and obtains authorization to purchase, or otherwise lawfully obtains, a rifle or shotgun shall be required to purchase or obtain a safety locking device at the time s/he purchases or obtains the rifle or shotgun.

(r) Pursuant to New York City Administrative Code § 10-311(d), the City of New York and its agencies, officers or employees shall not be liable to any party by reason of any incident involving, or the use or misuse of a safety locking device that may have been purchased in compliance with these rules.






*§ 1-06 Security.* ::


A licensee shall take all reasonable precautions to make the premises secure. These precautions shall include but not be limited to all applicable measures as listed below:

(a) Securing windows at or near ground level with expanded metal welded to bolted angle-iron frames.

(b) Securing the front of the premises with a metal folding scissors gate, roll-down door, or another similar device.

(c) Adequately protecting and securing all rear windows and doors, and skylights.

(d) Allowing the interior of the premises to be visible at all times; no drapes or blinds shall be used that would block the view of police or passersby who might observe unusual activity within the premises.

(e) Illuminating fully the exterior and interior of the premises at night, and during the hours when business is not conducted within.

(f) Installing alarms, or other appropriate security/service systems upon the premises.

(g) Posting signs prominently on the premises warning of the presence of electronic or other types of security systems and containing penalties for criminal violations.

(h) Installing high-security cylinder locks in all doors.

(i) In order to properly protect a licensee's premises and the weapons and ammunition stored within, the New York City Police Department requires that dealers utilize its "Crime Prevention Security Survey." A member of the New York City Police Department will come to a licensee's business establishment and inspect the building for security measures. After the inspection, the officer will recommend and suggest various methods in order to better protect the premises. These recommendations may include the choice of locks, gates, and alarm systems suitable for the licensee's premises. The inspection is free of charge. Licensees shall contact their local police precinct, and request an appointment with the Crime Prevention Officer or the Community Policing Supervisor for a survey of the premises.

Such offense shall constitute a misdemeanor if the offender has previously been found guilty of such violation or if the violation is committed under circumstances which create a substantial risk of physical injury to another person. The Rifle/Shotgun Section recognizes that all organizations have incurred an obligation by being registered to maintain and use rifles and shotguns in a responsible fashion. In order to assist organizations, the Rifle/Shotgun Section has issued the following safety guidelines for storing rifles and shotguns on the premises:

   (2) Rifles and shotguns shall be incapable of firing when not in use. Rifles and shotguns may be temporarily deactivated by removing magazines or bolts; by securing with bars or chains through the trigger guard; or by using individual trigger locks or other safety locking devices composed primarily of steel or other metal of significant gauge to inhibit breaking.

   (3) A custodian and alternate custodian shall keep one updated inventory of all rifles and shotguns possessed by the organization in the event of loss or theft. Such inventory shall include a full description of each rifle and shotgun including manufacturer, model, serial number, if applicable, and calibre or gauge. The certificate of registration issued for each rifle and shotgun shall accompany these records.

   (4) In the event of loss or theft of any rifle or shotgun, certificate of registration, ammunition, or organization registration certificate, the custodian or alternate custodian is required to report the loss or theft to her/his local precinct and notify the Rifle/Shotgun Section by telephone on the next business day after discovery of the loss or theft. Follow up with a written notification to the Rifle/Shotgun Section within 10 calendar days of discovery of the loss or theft is also required.

(b) Any organization that stores in excess of two hundred (200) cartridges shall be required to obtain a storage permit from the Fire Commissioner. The storage of ammunition without a valid permit issued by the Fire Commissioner shall be deemed sufficient cause to revoke an organization's registration certificate.

(c) The quantities of cartridges and other ammunition stored on the premises shall not exceed the amounts fixed by the Fire Commissioner for storage of ammunition. The quantities so fixed shall be stated in the storage permit.

(d) All ammunition kept on the premises shall not be stored in an area where other materials of a highly flammable nature are manufactured or stored.

(e) Ammunition shall be stored in an area of the premises that can be reasonably secured. Only the custodian, alternate custodian, and authorized members or employees shall have access to this storage area.

*§ 2-07 Security Plan.* ::


In order to properly protect an organization's premises and the rifles, shotguns and ammunition stored within, the Rifle/Shotgun Section requires that custodians utilize the New York City Police Department's Crime Prevention Security Survey. A member of the New York City Police Department will come to an organization's premises and inspect the building for security measures. After the inspection, the officer will recommend and suggest various methods designed to better protect the premises. These recommendations may include the choice of locks, gates, and alarm systems suitable for the premises. The inspection is free of charge. An organization shall contact its local police precinct, and request an appointment with the Crime Prevention Officer or the Community Policing Supervisor for a survey of the premises of the organization.






*§ 2-08 Separability.* ::


If any clause, sentence, paragraph, or part of these Rules of the application to any organization, custodian, or circumstances shall be determined to be invalid, such determination shall not affect, impair or invalidate the remainder thereof.

Chapter 5: Handgun Licenses
--------------------------------------------------




**Subchapter A: Issuance of Handgun Licenses**



*§ 5-01 Types of Handgun Licenses.* ::


As used in this chapter, the term "handgun" shall mean a pistol or revolver. This section contains a description of the various types of handgun licenses issued by the Police Department. 38 RCNY § 5-09 contains a description of the procedure for obtaining an exemption from New York State Penal Law Article 265, allowing pre-license possession of a handgun for the purpose of possessing and using a handgun for instructional purposes with a certified instructor in small arms at an authorized small arms range/shooting club.

(a) Premises License – Residence or Business. This is a restricted handgun license, issued for a specific business or residence location. The handgun shall be safeguarded at the specific address indicated on the license. This license permits the transporting of an unloaded handgun directly to and from an authorized small arms range/shooting club, secured unloaded in a locked container. Ammunition shall be carried separately.

(b) Carry Business License. This is an unrestricted class of license which permits the carrying of a handgun concealed on the person. In the event that an applicant is not found by the License Division to be qualified for a Carry Business License, the License Division, based on its investigation of the applicant, may offer a Limited Carry Business License or a Business Premises License to an applicant.

(c) Limited Carry Business License. This is a restricted handgun license which permits the licensee to carry the handgun listed on the license concealed on the person to and from specific locations during the specific days and times set forth on the license. Proper cause, as defined in 38 RCNY § 5-03, shall need to be shown only for that specific time frame that the applicant needs to carry a handgun concealed on her/his person. At all other times the handgun shall be safeguarded at the specific address indicated on the license, and secured unloaded in a locked container.

(d) Carry Guard License/Gun Custodian License. These are restricted types of carry licenses, valid when the holder is actually engaged in a work assignment as a security guard or gun custodian.

(e) Special Licenses. Special licenses are issued according to the provisions of § 400.00 of the New York State Penal Law, to persons in possession of a valid New York State County License. The revocation, cancellation, suspension or surrender of such person's County License automatically renders her/his New York City license void. The holder of a Special License shall carry her/his County License at all times when possessing a handgun pursuant to such Special License.

   (1) Special Carry Business License. This is a special license, permitting the carrying of a concealed handgun on the person while the licensee is in New York City.

   (2) Special Carry Guard License/Gun Custodian License. These are restricted types of special licenses that permit the carrying of a concealed handgun on the person only when the licensee is actually engaged in the performance of her/his duties as a security guard or gun custodian.






*§ 5-02 Premises Licenses.* ::


The requirements for the issuance of a Premises License are listed below. The license application shall be investigated, including a review of the circumstances relevant to the information provided in the application. During the pendency of the application, the applicant shall notify the License Division of any necessary correction to or modification of the information provided in the original application, or any change in her/his status or circumstances, which may be relevant to the application. The applicant shall:

(a) Be of good moral character;

(b) Have no prior conviction for a felony or other serious offense, as defined in § 265.00(17) of the New York State Penal Law, or of a misdemeanor crime of domestic violence, as defined in § 921(a) of title 18 of the United States Code;

(c) Disclose whether s/he is or has been the subject or recipient of an order of protection or a temporary order of protection;

(d) Have no prior revocation of a license nor be the subject of a suspension or ineligibility order issued pursuant to § 530.14 of the New York State Criminal Procedure Law or § 842-a of the New York State Family Court Act;

(e) Disclose any history of mental illness;

(f) Be free from any disability or condition that may affect the ability to safely possess or use a handgun;

(g) Reside or maintain a principal place of business within the confines of New York City;

(h) Be an applicant concerning whom no good cause exists for the denial of such license;

(i) Be at least 21 years of age.






*§ 5-03 Carry and Special Handgun Licenses.* ::


In addition to the requirements in 38 RCNY § 5-02, an applicant seeking a carry or special handgun license shall be required to show "proper cause" pursuant to § 400.00(2)(f) of the New York State Penal Law. "Proper cause" is determined by a review of all relevant information bearing on the claimed need of the applicant for the license. The following are examples of factors which will shall be considered in such a review.

(a) Exposure of the applicant by reason of employment or business necessity to extraordinary personal danger requiring authorization to carry a handgun.

   Example: Employment in a position in which the applicant routinely engages in transactions involving substantial amounts of cash, jewelry or other valuables or negotiable items. In these instances, the applicant shall furnish documentary proof that her/his employment actually requires that s/he be authorized to carry a handgun, and that s/he routinely engages in such transactions.

(b) Exposure of the applicant to extraordinary personal danger, documented by proof of recurrent threats to life or safety requiring authorization to carry a handgun.

   Example: Instances in which Police Department records demonstrate that the life and well-being of an individual is endangered, and that s/he should, therefore, be authorized to carry a handgun. The factors listed above are not all inclusive, and the License Division will consider any proof, including New York City Police Department records, which document the need for a handgun license. It should be noted, however, that the mere fact that an applicant has been the victim of a crime or resides in or is employed in a "high crime area," does not establish "proper cause" for the issuance of a carry or special handgun license.






*§ 5-04 Carry Guard License/Gun Custodian License and Special Carry Guard License/Gun Custodian License.* ::


(a) In addition to the requirements in 38 RCNY § 5-02 an applicant shall demonstrate the employer's need to employ armed security guards/gun custodians.

(c) Additionally, such need may be shown by other documentation or acceptable form as required by the License Division.

(d) If applicable, an applicant shall show satisfactory evidence that such business possesses a professional license, relevant to the need for a handgun, issued by the State of New York.

(e) In addition to the requirements in 38 RCNY § 5-06 an applicant shall show proof of current employment which requires the need for a handgun license.

Chapter 12: Return of Property from Property Clerk Division
--------------------------------------------------




**Subchapter A: Procedures For Claiming Property**



*§ 12-01 Introduction.* ::


The Property Clerk Division has established procedures regarding the return of property when claimed by the public. The classification of the property, arrest evidence, decedent's property, found property, etc., determines the documentation the claimant must provide in order to gain possession. In all cases, in addition to the necessary documentation, proper identification of the claimant is required. This can be in the form of licenses, credit cards, passports, bankbooks and utility bills (see appendix A of this chapter). In cases where the owner of property sends another person to pick up that property, the owner must provide such person a notarized letter authorizing such person to act on the owner's behalf, to be presented to the Property Clerk Division. Listed below in this subchapter are categories and general procedures for claimants to follow, in order to obtain property in our custody. Subchapter A of this chapter contains general provisions. Subchapter B of this chapter sets forth special procedures, which are followed by the Property Clerk and the District Attorneys with respect to claims for the return of property taken or obtained in connection with an arrest. Subchapter C of this chapter sets forth special procedures that shall be followed by the Property Clerk with respect to items of jewelry recovered in the vicinity of the World Trade Center site subsequent to the terrorist attack of September 11, 2001.

**Subchapter B: Procedures Relating To Property Taken Or Obtained In Connection With An Arrest**



*§ 12-31 Definitions.* ::


Arrest Evidence. The term "arrest evidence" shall mean property taken from the person or possession of an individual prior to, simultaneous with, or subsequent to an arrest because of its relation to the matter for which the person has been arrested. No property shall be deemed arrest evidence prior to the person's arrest. No property taken from a person and held by the Police Property Clerk merely for safekeeping shall be deemed arrest evidence.

Claimant. The term "claimant" shall mean the person from whose person or possession property, other than contraband, was taken or obtained, who is seeking from the police property clerk the return of such property in the police property clerk's possession or property that has been transferred by the police property clerk to the district attorney of any of the five counties of the city.

Contraband. The term "contraband" shall mean property the mere possession of which is prohibited under federal, state or local law. Property shall not be deemed to be contraband merely because it has been held as evidence or for custodial safe-keeping, or because it may be suspected or believed to be unlawfully obtained, stolen or the proceeds or instrumentality of a crime.

Days. The term "days" shall mean calendar days unless otherwise indicated.

District attorney's release. The term "district attorney's release" shall mean a statement from the appropriate district attorney's office that the subject property is no longer needed as evidence. A district attorney's release is not to be construed as a statement by the district attorney as to the possessory rights to the property of any person, including the claimant.

District attorney supervisor. The term "district attorney supervisor" shall mean an assistant district attorney with authority to review the denial of an application for a district attorney's release.

Proper identification. The term "proper identification" shall mean identification deemed acceptable and sufficient by the department of motor vehicles for the purpose of obtaining a driver's license. A list of such identification is contained in appendix A of this chapter.

Property. The term "property" shall mean and include all property, whether it is real property, personal property, money, negotiable instruments, securities, or any other thing of value or any interest in a thing of value.

Termination of criminal proceedings. The term "termination of criminal proceedings" shall mean the earliest of (i) thirty-one days following the imposition of sentence, (ii) the date of acquittal of a person arrested for an offense, (iii) where leave to file new charges or to resubmit the case to a new grand jury is required and has not been granted, thirty-one days following the dismissal of the last accusatory instrument filed in the case, or, if applicable, upon expiration of the time granted by the court or permitted by statute for filing new charges or resubmitting the case to a new grand jury, (iv) where leave to file new charges or to resubmit the case to a new grand jury is not required, thirty-one days following the dismissal of the last accusatory instrument filed in the case, or, if applicable, upon expiration of the time granted by the court or permitted by statute for filing new charges or resubmitting the case to a new grand jury, (v) six months from the issuance of an "Adjournment in Contemplation of Dismissal" order pursuant to C.P.L. § 170.55, or twelve months from the issuance of such an order pursuant to C.P.L. § 170.56, where the case is not restored to the court's calendar within the applicable six-month or twelve-month period, and (vi) the date when, prior to the filing of an accusatory instrument against a person arrested for an offense, the district attorney elects not to prosecute such person.






*§ 12-32 Vouchering Procedures.* ::


The police department and the district attorney, where applicable, of each of the five counties of the city have implemented the following procedures governing the taking or obtaining of non-contraband property from a person's possession at the time of arrest:

(a) The police shall make an inventory of such property and shall issue a voucher, which shall be given to the person as a receipt for items taken. The voucher shall contain the name of the person, a complete itemized list of all non-contraband property taken, and a brief description thereof.

(b) The person shall be given an opportunity to examine the voucher, and if such person finds the itemized list to be correct, such person may sign the voucher to acknowledge that it contains a complete list of property taken. Failure to sign the voucher shall not preclude a lawful claim being made for the property.

(c) The person must be informed that if he or she believes any additional non-contraband property was taken from his or her person or from his or her possession, or if he or she believes that property was erroneously vouchered to him or her, he or she may so indicate on the voucher. The arresting officer may sign the voucher indicating his or her concurrence with the list of items or any disagreement.

(d) A person is entitled to receive a voucher at the time of his or her arrest for property taken or obtained from his or her person or possession, and the other procedures set forth in these rules shall apply, regardless of whether the property has been denominated by the police department as "arrest evidence" or otherwise, and regardless of whether the arrest is prior to, simultaneous with, or subsequent to the taking or obtaining of the property.

(e) In bold letters on the back of the voucher, or on a separate sheet attached to the voucher, notice shall be given in plain English and Spanish setting forth the following procedures:

      (i) The person from whose possession the property was taken should retain and safeguard the voucher;

      (ii) In order to obtain the return of the property, the claimant or a representative authorized by a notarized writing to claim the property will be required to submit, in person or by mail, the voucher and proper identification to the office of the police property clerk located at a central location in each borough. The property may be disposed of by the police property clerk according to law unless the claimant demands the property no later than 120 days after the termination of criminal proceedings.

      (iii) A claimant demanding the return of property other than arrest evidence does not require a district attorney's release and may make such a demand whether or not criminal proceedings have been instituted and, if instituted, whether or not such proceedings have been terminated. As used herein, "property other than arrest evidence" refers to non-contraband property taken from an arrestee merely for safekeeping or taken from the person or possession of an individual prior to, simultaneous with or subsequent to an arrest which is unrelated to the matter for which the individual was arrested. Following receipt of a demand for such property, the property clerk may return the property or otherwise proceed pursuant to the provisions of 38 RCNY §§ 12-36 and 12-37.

      (iv) A claimant demanding the return of arrest evidence from the property clerk should obtain prior to the demand either a district attorney's release or a supervising district attorney's statement refusing to grant a release, although presentation of either or both of these documents to the property clerk is not required for making a timely demand. If demand for the property is made without a district attorney's release, or a supervising district attorney's statement, the claimant shall have 270 days from such demand to obtain a district attorney's release or a supervising district attorney's statement refusing to grant a release. If a release or statement refusing to grant a release is not provided to the property clerk within such period, the property may be disposed of according to law.

      (v) If a claimant timely provides the property clerk with a district attorney's statement refusing to grant a release, the claimant must thereafter obtain a district attorney's release to obtain the return of the property.

(f) In addition to the notice provided by the police property clerk, the district attorney shall, unless prohibited by the local arraigning court, provide the notice described in subdivision e of 38 RCNY § 12-32 to each person from whose person or possession property was taken or obtained when those persons initially appear at arraignment. The notice also shall set forth the procedures by which a claimant may obtain a district attorney's release and the procedures by which a claimant may seek review in the event that a release is denied. It is not required that the district attorney provide a copy of the voucher at arraignment.






*§ 12-33 Distribution and Posting of Notices Setting Forth the Procedures to be Followed to Obtain the Return of Property.* ::


The police department shall make available to any person requesting information about property in the possession of the police property clerk copies of the notice described in subdivision e of 38 RCNY § 12-32 at each station house and at each facility maintained by the property clerk. The police department shall post such notices, in no smaller than 24-point type, in the holding areas of all station houses, in all central booking facilities within the city and in each courthouse holding area within the city, that is within the control of the police department.






*§ 12-34 District Attorney's Release.* ::


The district attorney of each of the five counties of the city have implemented the following procedures governing the giving of releases for property that is arrest evidence:

(a) A request for a district attorney's release may be made, in person or by mail, by the claimant or by a representative authorized by a notarized writing by the claimant.

(b) The request must be accompanied by a copy of the voucher or, if the voucher is lost or absent, an explanation for its loss or absence, proper identification and suitable case identification. In his or her discretion, the district attorney may waive any or all of these requirements.

(c) If the request for a release is accompanied by the documents specified in subdivision b hereof, the district attorney shall, if the property is no longer needed as evidence, grant a release no more than fifteen days after receipt of the request. If the property is or may be needed as evidence, the district attorney shall follow the procedures hereinafter set forth.

(d) Before the termination of criminal proceedings, the district attorney shall provide a release to a claimant upon request unless the district attorney determines that the property is or may be needed as evidence. After the termination of criminal proceedings, the district attorney shall provide a release to a claimant upon request unless the district attorney determines that the property needs to be retained as evidence due to (i) a pending appeal; (ii) a collateral attack or notice that a collateral attack will be commenced; (iii) another specifically identified criminal proceeding or (iv) an ongoing identifiable criminal investigation. In all cases, a district attorney's determination not to provide a release to a claimant because the property is or may be needed as evidence shall be made in good faith. The district attorney's release shall be personally delivered to the claimant or mailed to the claimant at the address provided by the claimant on the form making the request for release.

(e) Whenever a release is denied to a claimant either before or following the termination of criminal proceedings, the district attorney must provide in writing the reason for the refusal no more than fifteen days after receipt of the request. The claimant also must then be informed that he or she may obtain review by a supervising assistant district attorney, who shall not be the individual who made the initial determination, which review must be provided to the claimant within ten days of the request for review. A supervising assistant district attorney's refusal to provide a claimant a release must be in writing stating the particularized reason(s) for the refusal, which reasons must be in conformity with subdivisions c and d, above. The notices provided by the district attorney shall be personally delivered to the claimant or mailed to the claimant at the address provided by the claimant on the form making the request for release.

(f) The claimant may reapply to the district attorney for a release at any time after the date of issuance of the statement upholding the denial.

(g) The district attorney may utilize standard forms, uniform throughout the five boroughs, consistent with these rules, for

   (i) Claimant's request for a district attorney's release, which shall also serve as an acknowledgement of receipt;

   (ii) Claimant's request for a review of a denial of a district attorney's release, a copy which shall also serve as an acknowledgement of receipt;

   (iii) District attorney supervisor's statement of reasons for upholding a denial of a release; and

   (iv) District attorney's release.






*§ 12-35 Disposition of Property by the Police Property Clerk Where There Has Been an Arrest.* ::


Where there has been an arrest prior to, simultaneous with, or subsequent to the taking or obtaining of the property, the property clerk shall take the following steps with regard to all vouchered property, subject to a different disposition required by other applicable federal, state or local law:

(a) Subject to the provisions of 38 RCNY §§ 12-36 and 12-37, the police property clerk shall return all non-contraband property other than arrest evidence to a claimant who produces proper identification and the voucher issued to him or her for the property. The property clerk shall not require such claimant to submit a district attorney's release covering such property, and such claimant may make a demand whether or not criminal proceedings have been instituted and, if instituted, whether or not such proceedings have been terminated.

(b) Subject to the provisions of 38 RCNY §§ 12-36 and 12-37, the police property clerk shall return all non-contraband arrest evidence, which is or shall hereinafter come into his or her possession or custody, upon timely demand, to a claimant who produces proper identification and who submits a written district attorney's release covering such property and the voucher issued at the time of arrest. Failure to produce the voucher shall not preclude a lawful claim being made for property, although the property clerk may require the claimant to explain the loss or absence of the voucher.

(c) A demand for the return of property shall be timely if made within 120 days after the termination of criminal proceedings, whether or not the demand is accompanied by a district attorney's release or a statement upholding a denial of the release. A demand may be made in person or by mail by the claimant or by a representative authorized in writing to claim the property on behalf of the claimant.

(d) If a timely demand is made without a district attorney's release, the property clerk may treat such a demand as an inquiry and require a claimant to provide, within 270 days of the inquiry, the property clerk with a district attorney's release or a supervising district attorney's statement upholding the denial of the release. If the claimant fails within such 270 days to provide the property clerk with a district attorney's release or a supervising district attorney's statement upholding the denial of the release, the property clerk may dispose of the property according to law.

(e) If the claimant provides the property clerk with a district attorney's release within the time period set forth in subdivision c, the property clerk shall return the property as required by subdivision b above. If the claimant provides the property clerk with a copy of the supervising district attorney's statement upholding the denial of the release, the property clerk must retain the property and shall either (i) return the property to the claimant when the claimant thereafter provides the property clerk with a district attorney's release, or (ii) when the property clerk learns that the property is not needed as evidence, give written notice to the claimant or the claimant's representative, at his or her last known address, which may be the address of a correctional facility, that the property will be returned forthwith to that person. Property that remains unclaimed for a period of 120 days after the date of the notice specified in (ii), or the remainder of the time provided to a claimant to obtain a release under subdivision d, whichever is greater, may be disposed of by the property clerk according to law.

(f) In no event shall a claimant be required to obtain any additional documentation or evidence relating to the property or be required to submit any proof of ownership of the property other than the voucher, except if the vouchered property is a motor vehicle, then title (or a reasonable explanation for its absence) may be required.

(g) The police property clerk must provide each claimant with a written "acknowledgement of demand or inquiry," indicating the date the demand or inquiry was made and a description of the property demanded.

(h) In any situation where the property clerk has returned property to the person from whom it was taken or obtained in accordance with this subchapter, the property clerk shall not be liable to any subsequent claimant for the same property.






*§ 12-36 Property Clerk Forfeiture Proceedings.* ::


Where the property clerk has reasonable cause to believe that property was unlawfully obtained or was the proceeds or instrumentality of a crime or otherwise may be subject to forfeiture under any applicable provision of law, the property clerk may refuse to return the property and may cause a civil forfeiture proceeding or other similar civil proceeding to be initiated in accordance with the following:

(a) Such proceeding may, subject to the time limitation below, be instituted either before or after a claimant makes a demand to the property clerk for the return of the property. If such proceeding is instituted before the termination of criminal proceedings against the claimant, this subchapter shall not be construed to effect any right of a party to the forfeiture proceeding to have the forfeiture proceeding stayed for such period as the court may determine. If a timely demand is made for the return of the property before the forfeiture proceeding is instituted, such proceeding shall be brought no later than (i) in the case of arrest evidence, 25 days after the claimant provides the property clerk with a district attorney's release, and (ii) in all other cases, as a district attorney's release is not required, within 25 days after the date of demand. If such proceeding is not commenced within this time period, the property clerk shall give written notice to the claimant or the claimant's representative, at his or her last known address, which may be the address of a correctional facility, that the property will be returned forthwith to that person. Property that remains unclaimed for a period of 120 days after the date of such notice may be disposed of by the property clerk according to law.

(b) Notice of commencement of a forfeiture proceeding by the property clerk shall include a statement of the grounds upon which the property clerk seeks to justify the continued retention of the property. Any such proceeding shall provide the claimant and any other interested persons with an adequate opportunity to be heard within a reasonable period of time. In any such proceeding the property clerk shall bear the burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence that the property clerk is legally justified to continue to retain the property.






*§ 12-37 Property Not Subject to Forfeiture but Subject to More Than One Claim.* ::


When property is not subject to forfeiture under 38 RCNY § 12-36, but is, or may be, subject to more than one claim, the police property clerk shall take the following action:

(a) Where the person from whom the property was taken makes a timely demand to the police property clerk for the return of the property, the property clerk shall return the property to the claimant unless an additional claim is made in writing or in person within 25 days of the claimant's demand, in which case the property clerk shall within five days of the date of the additional claim provide each interested person (including the original claimant) with the name and address of all such interested persons, and shall retain the property pending a disposition of the matter between the persons who claim it. If within 30 days thereafter no settlement is reached between the persons who claim it, and the police property clerk has received no court order regarding the property or any notice of any action pending between the persons who claim it regarding the property, the police property clerk shall release the property to the claimant from whom the property was taken.

(b) When acting as a stakeholder pursuant to the provisions of this section, the police property clerk will not be liable for costs, interest or damages arising out of the continued detention of such property or money. Nothing contained in this subchapter shall be deemed to either require or prohibit the police property clerk from initiating a stakeholder proceeding in accordance with the civil practice law and rules.






*§ 12-38 Investigatory Property.* ::


Investigatory property unconnected to an arrest (as distinguished from property seized at the time of an arrest or property seized in a case in which an arrest is later made) is not within the scope of this subchapter.




Chapter 12: Procedures Relating To Property Recovered In the Vicinity of the World Trade Center Site Subsequent To the Terrorist Attack of September 11, 2001
--------------------------------------------------



*§ 12-51 Introduction.* ::


Following the attack of September 11, 2001, the City of New York undertook extraordinary efforts to locate and preserve items of personal property recovered in the vicinity of the World Trade Center site. Property was found and vouchered at three major locations: Ground Zero itself, the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner, and a special facility at Fresh Kills landfill where police officers sorted through tons of material recovered from the disaster site. The Property Clerk has cleansed, sorted, collated, and categorized all property that came into the custody of the Police Department following the terrorist attack. The Property Clerk has conducted and continues to conduct comprehensive investigations, utilizing available technology, with the goal of determining ownership of each piece of property, regardless of the property's value. Where the Police Department has been able to establish the ownership of specific items that were recovered, those items have been returned to their owners. Thus far, property from approximately 72% of the 26,779 vouchers containing items recovered, has been returned. Ownership of the remaining vouchered property has yet to be determined. The Police Department recognizes that, whatever the monetary value of an individual piece of property may be, it may have great value to the survivors and family members of those whose lives were lost. As demonstrated by numerous requests from family members, this is particularly so as to jewelry that has been recovered. Therefore, the Police Department has committed special resources to examine and classify lost jewelry and has created a special questionnaire to assist individuals who may wish to make a claim for such items. Out of respect and concern for those who were killed and their family members, and the survivors of the attack, the City is establishing special procedures for individuals to provide the Property Clerk with information needed to determine the ownership of unclaimed jewelry remaining in the custody of the Property Clerk. The Police Department will also continue to process requests for the return of property other than jewelry made pursuant to the regular procedures of the Property Clerk. Because of the volume of items and the number of possible claims, it may be some time before ownership of claimed items can be determined. In many cases, claims may be made for items that have never been recovered. In many other cases, claims may be made for items with respect to which it is not possible to make a determination of ownership. For example, it may ultimately prove virtually impossible to ascertain ownership of certain property because of its generic nature or its condition when recovered. The ultimate disposition of items which are not claimed, or of items ownership of which cannot be determined, will be decided at a future time after people have had the opportunity to file claims as provided in this subchapter.






*§ 12-52 Property Covered by This Subchapter.* ::


This subchapter applies to claims for personal property recovered in the vicinity of the World Trade Center site following the attack of September 11, 2001, and within the custody of the Property Clerk as of no later than May 30, 2002.






*§ 12-53 Time for Making Claims.* ::


(a)  All claims pursuant to this subchapter shall be submitted on or before Tuesday, May 31, 2005. If the claim is mailed, it shall be deemed to have been submitted on the date the envelope is postmarked.

(b) Claims for jewelry. Claims for jewelry may be submitted electronically by selecting the WTC Property Claims link of the NYPD homepage at http://www.nyc.gov/nypd and utilizing the form provided on the site. Claims for jewelry may also be made on paper forms – the NYPD's WTC Jewelry Claim Form – which may be obtained in person from any police precinct, transit district, or housing bureau facility ("PSA"); by calling (888) 622-2545; or by mail from the Property Clerk Division's Manhattan Office, located at One Police Plaza, Room S-20, New York, New York 10038. Completed paper forms shall be submitted in person or by mail to the Property Clerk Division's Manhattan Office, World Trade Center Project, located at One Police Plaza, Room S-20, New York, New York 10038.

(c) Nothing in this subchapter shall limit the rights of persons to claim property under any other provision of law.






*§ 12-54 Review of Claims.* ::


(a)  The Property Clerk shall review the claims submitted pursuant to this subchapter and may require additional information, including but not limited to evidence of identity, ownership and letters testamentary or letters of administration.

(b) The Property Clerk may retain any item of personal property for a reasonable time to allow for the review of all claims filed in a timely manner under this rule or other applicable provision of law. However, the Property Clerk will continue with its procedure of returning property where in its discretion it determines that conclusive evidence of ownership has been provided.

(c) Nothing contained in this subchapter shall be deemed to either require or prohibit the Property Clerk from initiating an interpleader action in accordance with the civil practice law and rules.

Subject to the provisions of subdivision (b) of this section, civilian complaints found to be substantiated by the CCRB in which CCRB has recommended that Charges and Specifications be preferred shall be prosecuted by the CCRB pursuant to a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) executed on April 2, 2012 by the CCRB and the Department during the period that such MOU is applicable.

(b) In those limited circumstances where the Commissioner determines that CCRB's prosecution of Charges and Specifications in a substantiated case would be detrimental to the Department's disciplinary process, the Commissioner shall notify CCRB of this determination. These instances shall be limited to cases in which 1) there are parallel or related criminal investigations, or 2) when, in the case of an officer with no disciplinary history or prior substantiated CCRB complaints, and based on such officer's record and disciplinary history, the interests of justice would not be served.

The CCRB may reject such request to refrain from prosecution within five business days of receipt of such request. Such rejection shall be made in writing and include a statement rebutting the Commissioner's explanation for his or her request.

*§ 15-16 Conclusion of Administrative Prosecution.* ::


At the conclusion of the administrative prosecution, in all instances other than cases culminating in a report and recommendation by the Deputy Commissioner of Trials, the CCRB shall forward to the Commissioner a final recommendation reflecting the results of its prosecution of the case. The CCRB shall include all relevant forms, memoranda and background information to assist the Commissioner in making a final disciplinary determination. If the case culminated in a hearing before the Deputy Commissioner of Trials, the provisions of Subchapter A of this Chapter shall apply, subject to the provisions of 38 RCNY § 15-19.






*§ 15-17 Police Commissioner's Determination.* ::


(a)  In all instances other than cases culminating in a report and recommendation by the Deputy Commissioner of Trials, upon receiving the final recommendation of CCRB with accompanying documents, the Commissioner may accept, reject, or modify the recommendation presented, or may ask CCRB for additional investigative or background information in its possession. He or she may also request further investigation or development of the record in the case to enable him or her to make a final determination in the case. If CCRB's recommendation is rejected or modified, CCRB will then be responsible for taking any appropriate follow-up action, such as proceeding with prosecution of the subject officer, engaging in additional investigation, or further developing the record in the case.

(b) The Department shall notify CCRB of the final disciplinary result and specific penalty in each case within thirty calendar days of the Commissioner's final determination.

Such notification shall be in writing and include a detailed explanation of the reasons for deviating from CCRB's recommendation including but not limited to each factor the Commissioner considered in making his or her decision.

(a) Documents or verbal information provided to CCRB by the Department or created by CCRB pursuant to the MOU executed on April 2, 2012 shall be considered confidential to the extent provided by New York State Civil Rights Law § 50-a or any other applicable law. CCRB shall not disclose any such document or verbal information to any person, organization or agency without first notifying the Department's Deputy Commissioner, Legal Matters and providing the Deputy Commissioner, Legal Matters a reasonable opportunity to review the proposed disclosure. This restriction on disclosure shall not apply to disclosures to the Deputy Commissioner of Trials, DAO, or the Department's Internal Affairs Bureau.

(b) Notwithstanding the provisions of subdivision (a) of this section, the CCRB and Department may also exchange information pursuant to subdivision (b) of 38 RCNY § 15-12 and 38 RCNY § 15-18 to the extent that the disclosure of such information does not tend to reveal the identity of a party or witness involved in the investigation or prosecution of the substantiated civilian complaint which is the subject matter of the correspondence.

In 2000, Congress passed the Victims of Trafficking and Violence Prevention Act to encourage victims regardless of immigration status to report crimes and contribute to investigations and prosecutions and to support law enforcement efforts to investigate and prosecute crimes committed against immigrant victims. The law authorized U nonimmigrant status, which can be sought by immigrant victims of certain crimes who previously assisted, are currently assisting, or are likely to be helpful to law enforcement in the investigation or prosecution of the crime. U nonimmigrant status is issued by the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services ("USCIS"), and once granted it provides these victims with temporary nonimmigrant status so that they can remain in the United States while assisting law enforcement.

To be eligible for U nonimmigrant status, immigrant victims must satisfy several federal statutory requirements, which include a completed law enforcement certification. Immigrant victims may apply for certifications on their own, and the assistance of an attorney is not required. Under the law, local law enforcement agencies, such as the New York City Police Department ("NYPD"), have the discretion to approve or deny a request for certification. Certifications issued by the NYPD are free of charge. The NYPD is committed to serving all communities in the City of New York, especially those vulnerable to victimization, and recognizes the value of completing certifications and supporting immigrant victims of crime who are helpful in investigations or prosecutions.

Chapter 23: Requesting Declarations for T Nonimmigrant Status (T Declarations)
--------------------------------------------------



*§ 23-01 Introduction.* ::


In 2000, Congress passed the Victims of Trafficking and Violence Protection Act to encourage victims, regardless of immigration status, to report crimes, and to support law enforcement efforts to investigate and prosecute human trafficking, such as sex or labor trafficking as defined by federal law. The law authorized T nonimmigrant status (commonly referred to as "T visa"), which can be sought by immigrants who are victims of a severe form of human trafficking and who assist law enforcement in the investigation or prosecution of human trafficking. T nonimmigrant status is issued by the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services ("USCIS"), and once granted it provides these victims with temporary nonimmigrant status so that they can remain in the United States.

Immigrant victims must satisfy several federal statutory requirements to apply for T nonimmigrant status, which include demonstrating that he or she has been a victim of a severe form of human trafficking and has complied with any request from a law enforcement agency for assistance in the investigation or prosecution of human trafficking. A primary way that victims can demonstrate this is to submit a law enforcement declaration. Although this declaration is not required for the T nonimmigrant status application, USCIS considers the signed law enforcement declaration as primary evidence that the victim has been the victim of a severe form of human trafficking and is assisting or has assisted in the investigation or prosecution of human trafficking.

Victims may apply for declarations on their own, and the assistance of an attorney is not required. Under the law, law enforcement agencies, such as the New York City Police Department ("Department"), have the discretion to approve or deny a declaration. The Department is committed to serving all communities in the City of New York, especially those vulnerable to victimization, and recognizes the value of completing declarations and supporting immigrant victims of human trafficking who are helpful in investigations or prosecutions.
