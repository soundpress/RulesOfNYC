(c) Denial of an Application. The Chairperson can reject or deny a new Application for a License for the reasons specified in this section. If, at the time of submission of an Application by the Applicant, the Chairperson identifies that the Applicant meets the criteria in this section, the Chairperson will reject the Application and no Application fees will be accepted.

         1. The three-year ban will apply if, while license revocation charges were pending, a prior License expired or was surrendered to the Chairperson.

         2. Special Consideration for Critical Driver Program and Persistent Violator Program Revocations. After a minimum of one year from the date the Critical Driver or Persistent Violator summons is issued, an Applicant may request a waiver of the three-year ban from the Chairperson. This request can only be made if the Applicant's driving record reflects no more than three points for violations that occurred during the three year period preceding the date of the request for the waiver.

   (2) One-Year Ban. The Chairperson can deny an Application if, during the previous one year, the Applicant has committed:

      (ii) The traffic infraction of unlicensed operation of a motor vehicle.

   (3) Other Reasons for Denial of an Application.

      (i) Mistake or Omission in the Application. The Chairperson can deny an Application if the Application includes any material mistake or omission, or if the Applicant fails to inform the Chairperson of any material change in the Application.

      (ii) Eligible for Critical Driver Penalty. The Chairperson can deny an Application if the Applicant would, if licensed, be subject to License suspension or revocation under the Critical Driver Program at the time the Application is submitted.

         (1) For purposes of this subparagraph, TLC will consider DMV points accrued no earlier than 15 months prior to the date of the application in order to determine whether the new applicant meets the Critical Driver Program standard.

      (iii) Pendency of Criminal Charges. The Chairperson will defer consideration of an Application if the Applicant has criminal charges pending. If the charges are not resolved within 90 days after the submission of the Application, the Application will be denied.

(d) Failure to Complete Application Requirements.

   (1) The Chairperson will deny an Application for a new License if the Applicant has not completed all the requirements of an Application within 90 days of the date the application is filed.

   (2) The Chairperson will deny an Application for a renewal License if the Applicant has not completed all the requirements of an Application within 180 days after the expiration date of the prior License.

   (3) The Chairperson will not deny an Application under this Rule if completion is delayed because the Chairperson has not issued a final decision and the Applicant has complied with any requests made by the Chairperson.

(e) Additional Consideration of an Application. If a review of the Application leads the Chairperson to believe that the Applicant may not be Fit to Hold a License, the Chairperson may seek additional information from the Applicant. This request for additional information may be an in-person interview, telephone call, letter, e-mail, or other method of communication. This additional consideration may result in the denial of the Application.

(b) Critical Driver's Program. ("Points" in this Section refers to points assessed by the Department of Motor Vehicles). In addition to any other action the Commission might take, the following penalties will be enforced as part of the Commission's Critical Driver's Program:

   (1) License Suspension. If, within a 15-month period, a Driver accumulates six or more points but fewer than ten points on his or her driver's license (whether issued by New York or another state), the Commission will suspend the Driver's Paratransit Driver's License for 30 days.

   (2) License Revocation. If, within a 15-month period, a Driver accumulates 10 or more points on his or her driver's license (whether issued by New York or another state), the Commission will revoke the Driver's Paratransit Driver's License.

   (3) Review of Driver Fitness. The Commission can at any time review the fitness of a Driver to continue to be licensed following any moving violation, Collision, or other driving-related incident and can seek to impose other, additional, and/or more severe penalties or take any other action permitted under these Rules.

   (4) 15-Month Period. When determining whether a suspension or revocation is required based on the accumulation of points in a 15-month period, the Commission will calculate the 15-month period by counting backwards 15 months from the date of the most recent conviction for the violation carrying points that is cited in the summons issued under this section.

   (5) Date of Point Accumulation. For the purpose of this rule, points assigned by the Department of Motor Vehicles for any violation will be counted as of the date of conviction.

   (6) Multiple Points from a Single Incident. A Driver can be fined points against his or her license for multiple violations arising from a single incident. For the purpose of calculating points that might lead to a License suspension or revocation, if a Driver has accumulated points for multiple violations arising from a single incident, the Commission will count the single violation with the highest point total.

   (7) Point Reduction for Voluntary Course Completion.

      (i) Before suspending or revoking a Driver's License, the Commission will, for purposes of the Critical Driver's Program, deduct three points from the total points that appear on the Licensee's driving record maintained by the DMV, or equivalent licensing agency of the state which issued such license, of any Licensee who voluntarily attends and satisfactorily completes a Defensive Driving Course. Such point reduction will count only towards points accumulated by the Licensee as a result of the conviction for violations that occurred within 15 months prior to the date of the completion of the course; counting from the date of conviction. In order for the Defensive Driving Course to reduce the Licensee's Critical Driver Program points, the course must be satisfactorily completed prior to the adjudication of the Critical Driver summons. Completion of the Defensive Driving Course after the adjudication of a Critical Driver Program summons will reduce the Licensee's Critical Driver's Program points only after the Licensee completes his or her suspension. If the Licensee's driver's license was issued by a state other than New York, the Licensee must submit a recent driving abstract from the state of licensure.

      (ii) The Driver must furnish the Commission with proof when the course was taken and that the course was satisfactorily completed before the Commission will reduce the Driver's point total.

      (iii) If the Commission has already suspended or revoked the Driver's License, the point reduction will not change the Commission's decision.

      (iv) The Commission will not reduce the total points of any Driver more than once in any 18-month period.

(c) [Reserved.] Program for Persistent Violators.

*§ 57-13 Comply with Laws – Traffic Laws &amp; Miscellaneous.* ::


(a) Critical Driver's Program ("Points" in this Section refers to points assessed by the Department of Motor Vehicles). In addition to any other action the Commission might take, the following penalties will be enforced as part of the Commission's Critical Driver's Program:

   (1) License Suspension. If, within a 15-month period, a Driver accumulates six or more points but fewer than ten points on his or her driver's license (whether issued by New York or another state), the Commission will suspend the Driver's Commuter Van Driver's License for 30 days.

   (2) License Revocation. If, within a 15-month period, a Driver accumulates 10 or more points on his or her driver's license (whether issued by New York or another state), the Commission will revoke the Driver's Commuter Van Driver's License.

   (3) Review of Driver Fitness. The Commission can at any time review the fitness of a Driver to continue to be licensed following any moving violation, Collision, or other driving-related incident and can seek to impose other, additional, and/or more severe penalties or take any other action permitted under these Rules.

   (4) 15-Month Period. When determining whether a suspension or revocation is required based on the accumulation of points in a 15-month period, the Commission will count backwards 15 months from the date of the most recent conviction for the violation carrying points that is cited in the summons issued under this section.

   (5) Date of Point Accumulation. For the purpose of this rule, points assigned by the Department of Motor Vehicles for any violation will be counted as of the date of conviction.

   (6) Multiple Points from a Single Incident. A Driver can be fined points against his or her license for multiple violations arising from a single incident. For the purpose of calculating points that might lead to a License suspension or revocation, the Commission will count the single violation with the highest point total, if a Driver has accumulated points for multiple violations arising from a single incident.

   (7) Point Reduction for Voluntary Course Completion.

      (i) Before suspending or revoking a Driver's License, the Commission will, for purposes of the Critical Driver's Program, deduct three points from the total points that appear on the Licensee's driving record maintained by the DMV, or equivalent licensing agency of the state which issued such license, of any Licensee who voluntarily attends and satisfactorily completes a Defensive Driving Course. Such point reduction will count only towards points accumulated by the Licensee as a result of the conviction for violations that occurred within 15 months prior to the date of the completion of the course, counting from the date of conviction. In order for the Defensive Driving Course to reduce the Licensee's Critical Driver Program points, the course must be satisfactorily completed prior to the adjudication of the Critical Driver summons. Completion of the Defensive Driving Course after the adjudication of a Critical Driver Program summons will reduce the Licensee's Critical Driver's Program points only after the Licensee completes his or her suspension. If the Licensee's driver's license was issued by a state other than New York, the Licensee must submit a recent driving abstract from the state of licensure.

      (ii) The Driver must furnish the Commission with proof when the course was taken and that the course was satisfactorily completed before the Commission will reduce the Driver's point total.

      (iii) If the Commission has already suspended or revoked the Driver's License, the point reduction will not change the Commission's decision.

      (iv) The Commission will not reduce the total points of any Driver more than once in any 18-month period.

(b) [Reserved.]

The $5.00 Passenger No-Show Fee applies if the Passenger does not appear at the pickup location within ten minutes of driver’s arrival for on-demand trips or within ten minutes of the scheduled pickup time for reservation trips.

The Cancellation Fee applies if the Passenger cancels the trip after the Driver has traveled more than 0.5 miles to the Passenger pickup location following acceptance of the trip. The Cancellation Fee will be calculated by subtracting $5.00 from the appropriate Dispatch Fee for the distance traveled by the Driver at the time of cancellation.

Example: The Driver of a Taxi making a trip of more than 2 miles to pick up a Passenger and the Passenger cancels the trip after the Driver has traveled at least half a mile will receive a net Dispatch Fee of $25.00 ($30.00 less the $5.00 Cancellation Fee).

      (xi) Credit Card Processing Surcharge for Leases entered into pursuant to 35 RCNY § 58-21(c)(1), 58-21(c)(2), 58-21(c)(3), or 58-21(c)(4) of these Rules:

         A. For daily leases under 35 RCNY § 58-21(c)(1) and 58-21(c)(2), an Owner of a Taxicab can charge a $11 surcharge per shift for credit card processing.

         B. For weekly leases under 35 RCNY § 58-21(c)(1) and 58-21(c)(2), an Owner of a Taxicab can charge a $66 surcharge per week for credit card processing.

         C. For leases under 35 RCNY § 58-21(c)(3) and 58-21(c)(4), an Owner of a Taxicab can charge a $132 surcharge per week for credit card processing.

         D. Beginning on January 1, 2013, each June and December, the TLC will review the Technology System's data to determine average credit card usage per shift. The TLC will review only the data for shifts at least seven hours long. Payments made by credit card shall be the entire amount paid by the passenger, as determined from the Technology System records reviewed. If, under this review, the amount of the average credit card usage per daily shift exceeds $200, the TLC will propose and support:

            a rule seeking an adjustment to the Credit Card Surcharge for daily leases under 35 RCNY § 58-21(c)(1), 58-21(c)(2), 58-21(c)(3) and 58-21(c)(4) so that it is equivalent to 5% of the average credit card usage per shift for the preceding four months, rounded to the nearest whole dollar;

            a rule seeking a similar adjustment to the Credit Card Surcharge for weekly leases under 35 RCNY § 58-21(c)(1) and 58-21(c)(2) by multiplying the per shift surcharge by six; and

            a rule seeking a similar adjustment to the Credit Card Surcharge for Medallion-only and Medallion and Vehicle leases under 35 RCNY § 58-21(c)(3) and 58-21(c)(4) by multiplying the shift rate surcharge by twelve.

            For example, if the average credit card usage per shift, using the criteria set forth above, is $200, the per shift surcharge shall be $10 ($60 per week, $120 per week for a lease under 35 RCNY § 58-21(c)(3) and (4)). If the average credit card usage per shift is $240, the per shift surcharge shall be $12 ($72 per week, $144 per week for a lease under 35 RCNY § 58-21(c)(3) and (4)). E. Upon enactment of any rule that changes the Credit Card Surcharge, the TLC will issue an industry notice setting forth the new Credit Card Surcharge. F. Notwithstanding the results of the review(s) above, the TLC will not adjust, propose, or seek an adjustment to Credit Card Surcharges to any amount less than $10 for any daily lease entered into pursuant to 35 RCNY § 58-21(c)(1), 58-21(c)(2), or less than $60 for any weekly lease entered into pursuant to 35 RCNY § 58-21(c)(1), 58-21(c)(2), or less than $120 for any lease entered into pursuant 58-21(c)(3) and 58-21(c)(4), irrespective of the average credit card usage per shift.

      (i) Gasoline is provided to the lessee for the entire shift at no additional cost to the lessee.

      (ii) The surcharge will be $126 per week (or $21 per shift) until December 31, 2012

      (iii) After that date the surcharge will be reset based on the trailing 6 month average as of the date the surcharge is calculated of the New York City Gasoline Price Index issued by U.S. Energy Information Agency and published at www.eia.gov.

      (iv) The surcharge will be calculated as of June 30 and November 30 of each year beginning November 30, 2012.

      (v) The Commission will post the new surcharge on its Web site by July 15 and December 15 of each year

      (vi) The new surcharge will take effect on July 31 and December 31 of each year beginning December 31, 2012. If the Commission has not posted a new surcharge, the prior surcharge will remain in effect.

      (ii) The charge for each additional unit is $.50

      (iii) The unit of fare is:

         A. One-fifth of a mile, when the Taxicab is traveling at 12 miles an hour or more; or

      (iv) The Taximeter must combine fractional measures of distance and time in accruing a unit of fare. Any combination of distance or time specified in paragraph (iii) above must be computed by the Taximeter in accordance with Handbook 44 of the National Institute of Standards and Technology.

      (v) The fare must include pre-assessment of the unit currently being accrued; the amount due can therefore include a full unit charge for a final, fractional unit.

   (2) Surcharges. In addition to the metered rate of fare, Taxicabs will add the following surcharges, except where surcharges are specifically exempted:

      (i) A rush hour surcharge of $1.00 for all trips beginning on a weekday after 4:00 P.M. and before 8:00 P.M.; this surcharge will not be applied on legal holidays

      (ii) The MTA Tax must be charged in addition to the Flat Rate.

      (iii) The Taximeter must reflect that this trip is a Flat Rate fare.

   (2) Calculating Fare for Multiple Stops to Manhattan. If passengers request multiple stops on a trip from Kennedy Airport to Manhattan, the fare will be determined as follows:

      (i) The first stop in Manhattan is paid as required by paragraph (1) of this subdivision.

      (ii) The Taximeter is then turned on as if for a new trip and a new fare is calculated as a regular metered trip.

      (iii) The total metered fare (plus any surcharge) is paid at the last stop by the remaining passenger.

      (iv) No fare is due at the time any other passengers are dropped off between the first and last passenger.

   (2) The Chairperson will deny an application for a renewal License if the Applicant has not completed all the requirements of an application within by the expiration date of the prior License.

   (3) The Chairperson will not deny an application under this Rule if completion is delayed because the Chairperson has not issued a final decision and the Applicant has complied with any requests made by the Chairperson.

(d) Additional Consideration of an Application. If a review of the application leads the Chairperson to believe that the Applicant may not be Fit to Hold a License, the Chairperson may seek additional information from the Applicant. This request for additional information may be an in-person interview, telephone call, letter, e-mail, or other method of communication. This additional consideration may result in the denial of the application. Failure to provide any requested information within the time frame requested, or failure to appear at a scheduled interview will result in a denial of the application.

*§ 80-27 Special Driver Penalty Programs.* ::


(a) Critical Driver’s Program (“Points” in this subdivision refers to points assessed by the Department of Motor Vehicles). In addition to any other action the Commission might take, the following penalties will be enforced as part of the Commission’s Critical Driver’s Program:

   (1) License Suspension. If, within a 15-month period, a Driver accumulates six or more points but fewer than ten points on his or her Chauffeur’s license (whether issued by New York or another state), the Commission will suspend the Driver’s TLC License for 30 days.

   (2) License Revocation. If, within a 15-month period, a Driver accumulates 10 or more points on his or her Chauffeur’s license (whether issued by New York or another state), the Commission will revoke the Driver’s TLC License.

   (3) Review of Driver Fitness. The Commission can at any time review the fitness of a Driver to continue to be Licensed following any moving violation, Collision, or other driving-related incident and can seek to impose other, additional, and/or more severe penalties or take any other action permitted under these Rules.

   (4) 15-Month Period. When determining whether a suspension or revocation is required based on the accumulation of points in a 15-month period, the Commission will count backwards 15 months from the date of the most recent conviction for the violation carrying points that is cited in the summons under this section.

   (5) Date of Point Accumulation. For the purpose of this rule, points assigned by the Department of Motor Vehicles for any violation will be counted as of the date of conviction.

   (6) Multiple Points from a Single Incident. For a Driver who has been found guilty of multiple violations arising from a single incident, the Commission will consider the Driver guilty of the single violation with the highest point total for purposes of this section.

   (7) Point Reduction for Voluntary Course Completion.

      (i) Before suspending or revoking a Driver’s License, the Commission will, for purposes of the Critical Driver’s Program, deduct three points from the total points that appear on the Licensee’s driving record maintained by the DMV, or equivalent licensing agency of the state which issued such license, of any Licensee who voluntarily attends and satisfactorily completes a Defensive Driving Course. Such point reduction will count only towards points accumulated by the Licensee as a result of the conviction for violations that occurred within 15 months prior to the date of the completion of the course; counting from the date of conviction. In order for the Defensive Driving Course to reduce the Licensee’s Critical Driver Program points, the course must be satisfactorily completed prior to the adjudication of the Critical Driver summons. Completion of the Defensive Driving Course after the adjudication of a Critical Driver Program summons will reduce the Licensee’s Critical Driver Program points only after the Licensee completes his or her suspension. If the Licensee’s driver’s license was issued by a state other than New York, the Licensee must submit a recent driving abstract from the state of licensure.

      (ii) The Driver must furnish the Commission with proof of when the course was taken and that the course was satisfactorily completed before the Commission will reduce the Driver’s point total.

      (iii) If the Commission has already suspended or revoked the Driver’s License, the point reduction will not change the Commission’s decision.

      (iv) The Commission will not reduce total points more than once in any 18-month period.

   (8) Authorized Drivers of Street Hail Liveries Licensed under other Chapters of these Rules. Any points accumulated under this Chapter by a Paratransit Driver operating an Accessible Street Hail Livery will count towards and be applied to the Driver’s Paratransit Driver’s License as specified in 35 RCNY § 56-13(b), and the Driver may incur the penalties specified as a result.

(b) Program for Persistent Violators of Drivers’ Rules (“Points” in this subdivision refers to points assessed by the Commission; these points are included in the penalties for specific violations of rules in this subdivision).

   (1) Suspension and Revocation – Points and Time Periods.

      (i) Any Driver who has accumulated six or more Commission-issued points but fewer than ten points against his or her TLC Driver License within a 15-month period and whose License has not been revoked will have his or her License suspended for up to 30 days.
