      (F) the use of a political committee or other entity over which a candidate exercises authority to conceal from the Board expenditures that directly or indirectly assist or benefit the candidate's nomination or election.

   (ii) In the event of a fundamental breach of a candidate's certification, the candidate will be deemed by the Board to be ineligible for public funds for the covered election and to have forfeited all public funds previously received for the elections covered by the Certification. Additionally, the candidate will be subject to such civil and criminal sanctions as are applicable under § 3-711 of the Code and other applicable law.

   (iii) This section is not intended to be an enumeration of all circumstances that may constitute a fundamental breach of a candidate's certification, as may be determined by the Board.








*§ 3-02 Disqualification from Ballot.* ::


A candidate who has been disqualified from the ballot, or who is no longer opposed by a candidate who appears on the ballot, is not eligible to receive public funds.

(a) Notice of appeal. The candidate must notify the Board immediately, in writing, if the disqualified candidate is seeking to appeal or otherwise remedy a disqualification. This notice must indicate whether a judicial appeal is being taken as of right or by permission and the specific nature of any other judicial remedy sought.

*§ 3-03 Write-in Candidates.* ::


A candidate who is seeking nomination or election to a covered office as a write-in candidate must promptly notify the Board in writing.








*§ 3-04 Termination of Candidacies.* ::

(b) If the terminated candidate is seeking nomination or election as a write-in candidate, or, in the case of a participant, intends to submit a petition for public funds pursuant to 52 RCNY § 7-01(e)(ii), the candidate must notify the Board within five business days after receiving the notice of termination, in which case the Board may reverse the termination. A candidate whose termination has been reversed must continue to submit disclosure statements as required by these rules.

(c) A candidate may also request that the Board deem such candidate's candidacy terminated because such candidate has satisfied all three requirements of subdivision (a), or has satisfied requirements (1) and (2) of subdivision (a) and has ceased campaigning and has verified that fact in the form and manner required by the Board.

(b) Due dates. A candidate may submit proof of compliance with the Board and such proof shall be considered timely submitted if it is submitted to the Board on or prior to the last business day of July in the year of the covered election, except as provided by subdivision (a).






Title 52: Campaign Finance Board*
--------------------------------------------------



*§ 4-01 Records to be Kept.* ::


(a) Generally.

   (i) Candidates must keep records that enable the Board to verify the accuracy of disclosure statements, substantiate that expenditures were made in furtherance of the campaign, were qualified expenditures, or were permissible post-election expenditures, and confirm any matchable contributions claimed. Candidates must maintain and may be required to produce originals and copies of checks, bills, or other documentation to verify contributions, expenditures, or other transactions reported in their disclosure statements. Candidates must maintain clear and accurate records sufficient to show an audit trail that demonstrates compliance with the Act and these rules. The records must be made and maintained contemporaneously with the transactions recorded, and maintained and organized in a manner that facilitates expeditious review by the Board. Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to modify the requirements of § 14-118 of the New York State Election Law. The records maintained for each campaign finance transaction, whether maintained on paper or electronically, must be accurate and, if necessary, modified promptly to ensure continuing accuracy.

   (ii) If at any time a candidate becomes aware that a record of an expenditure is missing or incomplete, the candidate may create a new record or modify an existing record, provided that the record so created or modified is clearly identified by the candidate as such, and provided that the candidate also creates a record, in the form of a signed, dated, and notarized statement by the candidate, treasurer, or other campaign representative having first-hand knowledge of the matter, explaining the reasons for and the circumstances of the creation or modification of the missing or incomplete record. If the missing or incomplete record is an invoice or contract from a vendor, the candidate must in the first instance attempt to get a duplicate or more complete record directly from such vendor. The Board reserves the right not to accept such non-contemporaneous record created or modified pursuant to this paragraph if it deems that the record is not sufficient to document the actual transaction.

(b) Receipts.

   (i) Deposit slips. Candidates must maintain copies of all deposit slips. The deposit slips must be grouped together with the monetary instruments representing the receipts deposited into the bank or other depository accounts held by the candidate for an election. Where the bank or depository does not provide itemized deposit slips, candidates must make a contemporaneous written record of each deposit. Such written record must indicate the date of the deposit, the amount of each item deposited, whether each item deposited was a check, a cashier's check, a money order, or cash, and the total amount deposited.

   (ii) Contribution and loan records.

      (D) Transfers. Candidates must maintain all records specified by the Board regarding transfers.

Contributions totaling $99 or less from a single source need not be separately itemized in a disclosure statement, unless such contributor is an employee of the candidate or of the spouse, or domestic partner of such candidate or of a business entity in which such candidate, spouse, or domestic partner has an ownership interest of 10% or more or in which such candidate, spouse or domestic partner holds a management position, such as the position of officer, director, or trustee.

      (D) Must itemize all contributions from a single source that exceeds $99. If a candidate has accepted contributions totaling more than $99 from a single source, all contributions comprising the total (including previously unitemized contributions) must be fully reported (i.e., itemized) in the same disclosure statement. All subsequent contributions from that single source must be fully reported as well.

      (E) Affiliated contributors. Affiliated contributors considered to be a "single source" under 52 RCNY §§ 1-02 and 5-10(b) must be reported.

   (iii) Other receipts. To fully report other receipts accepted during the reporting period, the candidate must report, for each receipt:

      (A) the date of receipt;

      (B) the amount of the receipt;

      (C) the type of receipt; and

      (D) such other information as the Board may require.

   (iv) Expenditures.

      (A) Reporting requirements. To fully report expenditures, including outstanding liabilities, made by the candidate during the reporting period, the disclosure statement must be itemized to include the following information:

         (1) the name and address of each vendor or payee;

         (2) the bill or invoice date and amount;

         (3) the purpose code and explanation of each expenditure;

         (4) the exempt code, if any; and

         (5) such other information as the Board may require.

      (B) In addition to the information required in subparagraph (A), candidates must provide the following information concerning each payment:

         (1) the date and amount of each payment, including exempt amount, if any;

         (2) the payment method, including check number and committee bank account; and

         (3) the amount of remaining outstanding liability to the vendor or payee; and

         (4) such other information as the Board may require.

      (C) Expenditures of less than $50. Expenditures of less than $50 do not need to be separately itemized in a disclosure statement; however, public funds may not be used to pay for unitemized expenditures.

      (D) Subcontractors.

         (1) In addition to reporting any expenditures to the vendor, if aggregate payments by the vendor to a subcontractor exceed $5,000, the candidate must report:

            (I) the name and address of that subcontractor;

            (II) the amount(s) expended to the subcontractor; and

            (III) the purpose code(s) of the subcontracted goods or services.

         (2) Disclosure must occur either beginning in the reporting period in which such cost first exceeds $5,000 or in the first post-election disclosure statement for the election to which the expenditure relates.

      (E) Credit card purchases. For expenditures paid with a credit card, the candidate must report the vendor and purchase price of any goods or services purchased. Disbursements to credit card accounts must not be itemized as such.

      (F) Contributions to political committees. Political contributions to political committees that support or oppose candidates in New York City (except political committees of other candidates), including state party committees, that are made by a candidate with such candidate's personal funds and that, in the aggregate for any single political committee, exceed the contribution limit applicable to the office of mayor for contributors having business dealings with the city pursuant to § 3-703(1-a) of the Code, are presumed to be expenditures in furtherance of the campaign's candidate and contributions from the candidate to the candidate's campaign, and, as such, must be reported to the Board. The candidate may rebut this presumption by providing evidence indicating that the contributions were not in furtherance of the campaign's candidate. Such contributions are subject to all applicable expenditure and contribution limits, except that contributions made to committees registered with the State Board of Elections or the Federal Election Commission as independent expenditure committees are not subject to such limits. Candidates must create and maintain records of such contributions. Contributions made with a candidate's personal funds as provided in this subparagraph shall not be the basis for a deduction from such candidate's public funds payment pursuant to 52 RCNY § 7-07(a).

      (G) Expenditure refunds. For expenditures of which all or a portion was refunded to the candidate by the vendor, the candidate must report the refund and provide an amended invoice or other documentation from the vendor specifying the amount, date, and reason for the refund, as well as proof of receipt of the refund in the form of a check, bank statement, or other financial documentation.

   (v) Intermediaries. In addition to fully reporting contributions, candidates must fully report any intermediary that solicited or delivered a contribution as provided in paragraph (ii) of this subdivision.

      (A) Exceptions.

         (1) The candidate need not report an intermediary for aggregate contributions of $500 or less collected from a contributor in connection with an event held at an individual's residence, unless the expenses related to such event exceed $500.

         (3) The candidate need not report an intermediary who is a spouse, domestic partner, parent, child, or sibling of the candidate.

      (B) Contributions collected at a non-campaign sponsored fundraising event with multiple hosts. In the case of contributions collected at a fundraising event neither organized by the candidate nor paid for in whole or in part by such candidate's authorized committee, where there are multiple hosts, the hosts must designate one host who must be reported by the candidate as the intermediary for all such contributions.

      (C) Contributions delivered by an intermediary's agent. The candidate must report as the intermediary an individual who solicits contribution(s) and directs such individual's agent to deliver them to the candidate or fundraising agent. The candidate must not report the agent as an intermediary.

   (vi) Transfers.

      (A) Transfers of funds shall consist entirely of contributions previously raised by the transferor committee and shall not include any public funds.

      (B) Candidates must report contemporaneously: (1) the aggregate amount of each transfer and (2) each contribution the transfer consists of (using a last-in/first out attribution), including the name and residential address of the contributor and the amount and date of the contribution.

      (C) In the case of a transfer to an authorized committee from a committee not otherwise involved in the covered election, unless the transferring committee is another authorized committee of the same candidate that has filed contemporaneous disclosure statements with the Board in a timely manner, participants must (1) report to the Board, in the same disclosure statement in which the transfer is reported, any expenditures incurred by the transferor committee in connection with raising or administering the transferred contributions, regardless of when the expenditures were incurred, and (2) upon request by the Board, disclose all expenditures made by the transferor committee during the covered election cycle for purposes other than raising or administering the transferred contributions. Further, candidates must submit contemporaneously the records required to be maintained pursuant to 52 RCNY § 4-01(b)(ii)(D).

   (vii) Advances and reimbursements.

      (A) For advance payments, the candidate must report in each disclosure statement:

         (2) the date and amount of each purchase;

         (3) the name and address of the individual or entity from whom the purchase has been made;

         (4) the payment method;

         (5) the purpose code and explanation of the purchase; and

         (6) such other information as the Board may require.

         (1) the name of each individual or entity, including the candidate, whom the candidate reimbursed for purchases made on behalf of the committee during the reporting period;

         (2) the date and amount of each reimbursement;

         (3) the payment method of each reimbursement, provided that, if the reimbursement is done by check, the candidate must also report the bank account and check number from which the check was issued; and

         (4) such other information as the Board may require.

      (viii) Loans. Each disclosure statement shall include the following information about loans accepted, forgiven, or repaid by the candidate during the reporting period:

The first such disclosure must be received by the Board within 24 hours after the contribution or loan that causes the total to exceed $1,000 is accepted or the expenditure that causes the total to exceed $20,000 is made. Each subsequent disclosure must be received by the Board within 24 hours after any additional contribution or loan is accepted or expenditure is made. Information reported in these disclosures must also be included in the candidate's next post-election disclosure statement.








*§ 4-07 Terminated Candidacy.* ::


A candidate need not submit any disclosure statements for periods subsequent to the termination of such candidate's candidacy, as described in 52 RCNY § 3-04, unless the termination is reversed pursuant to 52 RCNY § 3-04(b).

*§ 4-09 Candidates Not in Primary or General Elections.* ::


(a) Not in primary election. A candidate need not submit the two pre-primary and the 10 day post-primary election disclosure statements if the candidate is not a candidate in a primary election unless the candidate is a participant claiming that expenditures are subject to a primary election spending limit, pursuant to 52 RCNY § 6-01(h)(iii)(A) or 52 RCNY § 6-01(h)(iv). If the candidate is not a candidate in the primary, daily disclosures during the two weeks preceding the primary need not be submitted.

Title 52: Campaign Finance Board*
--------------------------------------------------



*§ 6-01 Expenditure Limits.* ::


(a) Participants may not exceed the applicable expenditure limits provided in § 3-706 of the Code.

(b) Adjustment. Pursuant to § 3-706(1) of the Code, not later than the first day of March in the year 2010, and every fourth year thereafter, the Board shall adjust the expenditure limits. Such adjustment shall be made in accordance with changes in the consumer price index for the metropolitan New York-New Jersey region published by the United States Bureau of Labor Statistics. The adjustment shall be based on the difference between the average consumer price index over the 12 months preceding the calendar year of such adjustment, and either (a) the calendar year preceding the year of the last such adjustment or (b) such other calendar year as may be appropriate pursuant to any amendment to the Act.

(c) Participants have the burden of monitoring their expenditures to be sure that they do not exceed the limit.

(d) Applicability. All expenditures made by a participant to further the participant's nomination or election, including expenditures made for the purpose of furthering or facilitating the defeat of the nomination or election of an opponent or prospective opponent, are subject to the expenditure limit applicable under the Act. All expenditures made by the participant shall be totaled to determine the participant's compliance with the applicable expenditure limit. Expenditures incurred after the last election in an election year in which the participant is a candidate, or a special election, are not subject to the expenditure limits for that election.

(e) Expenditures made during the three calendar years preceding the election. Expenditures made by a participant during the three calendar years preceding the year of a covered election are subject to the applicable expenditure limit set forth in § 3-706(2) of the Code. A participant is permitted to make expenditure in excess of this limit. However, pursuant to § 3-706(2a)(a), the amount by which the limits of § 3-706(2) are exceeded will be counted against the participant's first election year expenditure limit under § 3-706(1).

(f) Expenditures made during the year of the election. Expenditures made on or after the first day of January in the year of a covered election, and expenditures attributed to the year of the election pursuant to paragraph (v) of subdivision (h) of this section, are subject to the applicable expenditure limit set forth in § 3-706(1) of the Code.

(g) Expenditures for or against a ballot proposal. Expenditures made by a participant's principal committee for the purpose of advocating a vote for or against a proposal on the ballot in an election that is also a covered election, regardless of whether the expenditures were also made to further or facilitate the participant's nomination or election, shall be subject to the contribution and expenditure limits applicable to such covered election.

(h) Attributing an expenditure.

   (i) An expenditure is presumed to be made for the first covered election in which the participant or non-participant is a candidate following the day it is made, except:

      (A) expenditures made before the first January 12 after a state or local election will be presumed to be made for that election; and

      (B) expenditures made before the first January 1 after a federal election will be presumed to be made for that election, except as may otherwise be provided under federal law and regulations.

   (ii) No contested primary. If there is no contested primary election in any party for an office, expenditures made by a candidate seeking that office will be entirely attributed to the general election.

   (iii) Contested primary or write-in primary.

      (A) If there is a contested or write-in primary election in any party for an office, every participant or limited participant seeking that office, regardless of whether the participant or limited participant is in the primary election, may make expenditures subject to the primary election expenditure limit of § 3-706(1) of the Code, provided the participant or limited participant files the two pre-primary and 10 day post-primary election disclosure statements and daily disclosures pursuant to 52 RCNY § 4-05(b)(ii)(B), (C), and 52 RCNY § 4-06 in a timely manner. In this case, the general election expenditure limit will first apply after the date of the primary election.

      (B) Expenditures incurred after the date of the contested or write-in primary election will be attributed to the general election.

      (C) Expenditures incurred before the primary election by a candidate in a contested primary election are attributed to the primary election, regardless of whether the candidate also received the nomination of another party without a primary election.

   (iv) Reasonably anticipated primary. Expenditures may be attributed to a primary election that the Board has determined is reasonably anticipated.

      (A) If a participant demonstrates to the Board that for a period preceding the primary election the participant had reasonably anticipated a primary election in any party for the office the participant seeks, the participant may attribute expenditures made before and during that period to the primary election expenditure limit of § 3-706(1) of the Code, provided the participant files the two pre-primary and 10 day post-primary election disclosure statements and daily disclosures pursuant to 52 RCNY § 4-05(b)(ii)(B), (C), and 52 RCNY § 4-06 in a timely manner. In this case, the general election expenditure limit will first apply after that period.

      (B) In order to demonstrate to the Board that for a period preceding the primary election the participant had reasonably anticipated a primary election, the participant must file a petition, consisting of an affidavit with supporting documentation, with the Board no later than 10 business days following the date the last remaining candidate other than the participant was finally disqualified from the ballot as set forth in 52 RCNY § 7-01(e)(i).

         (1) The affidavit must:

            (I) be sworn to or affirmed by the candidate;

            (II) specify the period of time during which it was reasonable to anticipate that a primary election would be held;

            (III) identify the prospective candidate(s); and

            (IV) provide a factual basis for the participant's belief that a primary election was reasonably anticipated during the specified period of time.

         (2) The supporting documentation must demonstrate that the prospective candidate(s) engaged in activities that would lead a reasonable person to believe that such candidate(s) would participate in the primary election. Such activities may include:

            (I) authorizing a political committee with the Board of Elections for the primary election;

            (II) filing a Filer Registration or Certification with the Board;

            (III) engaging in petitioning activity, including the filing of petitions with the Board of Elections;

            (IV) producing and/or distributing campaign communications related to the primary election; and

            (V) campaigning for office or otherwise publicly declaring an intent to participate in the primary election.

      (C) Once it is determined that no primary election will be held for nomination to an office, or that such primary election is no longer reasonably anticipated, subsequent expenditures will be subject to the general election expenditure limit.

   (v) Timing of expenditures. As provided and described in §§ 3-706 (1) and (2) of the Code, an expenditure for goods or services is made when the goods or services are received, used, or rendered, regardless when payment is made. Expenditures for goods or services received, used, or rendered in more than one year, including campaign websites, shall be attributed in a reasonable manner to the expenditure limits of § 3-706(1) or (2) of the Code, as appropriate.

      (A) Expenditures for campaign advertising or other campaign communications shall be attributed to the expenditure limit in effect when the advertisement or communication is distributed, broadcast, or published. For the purposes of this paragraph, "campaign advertising or other campaign communications" shall not include a campaign website. A communication that is mailed shall be considered to have been "distributed" on the date on which it was postmarked.

      (B) Expenditures for services performed or deliverables provided over a period that includes both the primary and the general elections shall be attributed in a reasonable manner to the expenditure limits of §§ 3-706(1) and (2) of the Code, as appropriate.

      (C) Notwithstanding the requirements of this subdivision, the Board may require a candidate to demonstrate that an expenditure should be attributed to the expenditure limit provided in § 3-706(1) or (2) of the Code, as appropriate, based on the timing, nature, and purpose of the expenditure.

(i) Exempt expenditures.

   (i) The following shall not be subject to the expenditure limits:

      (A) expenses made for the purpose of bringing or responding to any action, proceeding, claim, or suit before any court or arbitrator or administrative agency to determine a candidate's or political committee's compliance with the requirements of this chapter, including eligibility for public funds payments, or pursuant to or with respect to election law or other law or regulation governing candidate or political committee activity or ballot status;

      (B) expenses to challenge or defend the validity of petitions of designation or nomination or certificates of nomination, acceptance, authorization, declination or substitution, and expenses related to the canvassing or re-canvassing of election results;

      (C) expenses related to the post-election audit, except as provided in paragraph (ii) of this subdivision; and

      (D) expenditures for childcare services made pursuant to § 3-702(21)(a)(13) of the Code for an aggregate amount of $20,000 or less.

   (ii) Exempt expenses related to the post-election audit shall include pre-election expenses for organizing and copying existing records in preparation for submission during the post-election audit, but shall not include pre-election expenses for:

      (A) Ordinary compliance activities, such as the review of records to identify missing documents, evaluating whether documents meet Board standards, and identifying, preventing, and correcting any potential violation;

      (B) Post-election work for which an invoice is issued or paid prior to the election;

      (C) Salaries or other payments to campaign managers, finance chairpersons, treasurers, accountants, advisors, or other consultants;

      (D) Legal or accounting fees;

      (E) Costs associated with record creation and retention;

      (F) Costs associated with running an office or business, such as standard bookkeeping, maintaining checkbook registers, petty cash journals, bank records, and loan records;

      (G) Bookkeeping for payroll or vendor payments; and

      (H) Other standard practices that political committees routinely perform as entities that raise and spend funds.

   (iii) Candidates have the burden of demonstrating that expenditures are exempt pursuant to § 3-706(4) of the Code. To meet this burden, a candidate must maintain contemporaneous, detailed records that demonstrate that each individual expenditure is exempt in accordance with the Act and these rules, and submit such documentation as required. Expenditures not demonstrated to be exempt will be included in the expenditure limit calculation.

   (iv) Notwithstanding anything otherwise provided for in this subdivision, the reimbursement of an advance shall not be considered an exempt expenditure.

   (v) For purposes of this subdivision, in determining whether a participant's total expenditures exceed the expenditure limits of § 3-706(1) or § 3-706(3)(a) of the Code, as appropriate, expenditures made in the first three years of the election cycle, to the extent such expenditures do not exceed the limit applicable under § 3-706(2) of the Code, shall be excluded.

(j) Expenditure limit compliance for a transfer between political committees.

   (i) A committee of a participant that receives a transfer of funds from another political committee, other than another principal committee of the same candidate, must:

      (A) allocate to the transferred contributions any expenditures incurred by the transferor committee in connection with raising transferred contributions, and any expenditures incurred by the transferor committee during the covered election cycle in connection with administering transferred contributions; and

      (B) upon request, provide documentation related to any such expenditures, including copies of federal forms or disclosure statements filed with the New York State Board of Elections on behalf of the transferor committee.

   (ii) Expenditures will be applied towards the expenditure limit in effect at the time of the transfer; provided, however, that in the case of transfers made prior to the covered election cycle, expenditures will be applied towards the expenditure limits of § 3-706(2) of the Code.

   (iii) The participant has the burden of demonstrating, for the purpose of compliance with the expenditure limits, that an expenditure made by the transferor committee was not made in connection with raising or administering the transferred contributions.

(k) Expenditure limit relief.

   (i) Pursuant to § 3-706(3)(a) of the Code, where the Board has determined that a non-participating candidate has spent or contracted or become obligated to spend, or received in loans or contributions, an amount which, in the aggregate, exceeds half the applicable expenditure limit pursuant to § 3-706(1)(a) of the Code, the expenditure limit applicable to participating candidates in the election for that office will be increased to 150% of the expenditure limit.

   (ii) Pursuant to § 3-706(3)(b) of the Code, where the Board has determined that a non-participating candidate has spent or contracted or become obligated to spend, or received in loans or contributions, an amount which, in the aggregate, exceeds three times the applicable expenditure limit pursuant to § 3-706(1)(a) of the Code, the expenditure limit will no longer apply to participating candidates in the election for that office.

*§ 6-03 Joint Expenditures; Endorsements.* ::


(a) Generally. Candidates may engage in joint campaign activities, including joint fundraising, joint petitioning, and the production of joint campaign literature, subject to applicable expenditure limits.

(b) Candidates must pay proportionally. A candidate must pay for the portion of the joint expenditure that is proportionally equivalent to such candidate's campaign's exposure in or benefit from the joint activity, unless the benefit is de minimis.

   (i) Candidates and other individuals or entities may present information to the Board establishing such a de minimis benefit pursuant to 52 RCNY § 12-02.

   (ii) Factors for proportional payment. Among the factors the Board will consider in determining whether the benefit to a candidate is proportionally equivalent to its expenditure or is de minimis are:

      (A) the geographic distribution or location of the material or activity;

      (B) the subject matter of the communication;

      (C) the references to the candidate or the candidate's appearances therein;

      (D) the relative prominence of a candidate's references or appearances in the communication, including the size and location of references to the candidate and any photographs of the candidate;

      (E) the timing of the communication; and

      (F) other circumstances of the communication.

(c) Non-proportional payment may lead to in-kind contribution. To the extent a candidate does not pay for the proportional benefit it receives, the candidate is considered to have received an in-kind contribution from the other candidate. An in-kind contribution is also an expenditure by the candidate receiving the contribution.

(d) Not joint expenditures. The following activities, by themselves, are not joint expenditures:

   (i) the act of appearing with another candidate;

   (ii) endorsing a candidate, or communicating about an endorsement or appearance in an insubstantial way, such as where the endorser's name is one of several names appearing on a communication and is of equivalent prominence as the other names; and

   (iii) giving fundraising assistance to another candidate in the form of de minimis written communications, such as allowing the use of one's name or signature on a letter soliciting funds for another candidate or on fundraising material where the endorser's name appears alone or with other names and is of equivalent prominence as the other names.








*§ 6-04 Independent Expenditures.* ::


(a) Factors for determining independence. In determining whether an expenditure is independent, the Board may consider any of the factors from the following non-exhaustive list:

   (i) whether the person or entity making the expenditure is also an agent of a candidate;

   (ii) whether any person authorized to accept receipts or make expenditures for the person or entity making the expenditure is also an agent of a candidate;

   (iii) whether a candidate has authorized, requested, suggested, fostered, or otherwise cooperated in any way in the formation or operation of the person or entity making the expenditure;

   (iv) whether the person or entity making the expenditure has been established, financed, maintained, or controlled by any of the same persons or entities as those that have established, financed, maintained, or controlled a political committee authorized by the candidate;

   (v) whether the candidate shares or rents space for a campaign-related purpose with or from the person or entity making the expenditure;

   (vi) whether the candidate has solicited or collected funds on behalf of the person or entity making the expenditure, during the same election cycle in which the expenditure is made;

   (vii) whether the candidate, or any public or private office held or entity controlled by the candidate, including any governmental agency, division, or office, has retained the professional services of the person making the expenditure or a principal member or professional or managerial employee of the entity making the expenditure, during the same election cycle in which the expenditure is made; and

   (viii) whether the candidate and the person or entity making the expenditure have each consulted or otherwise been in communication with the same third party or parties, if the candidate knew or should have known that the candidate's communication or relationship to the third party or parties would inform or result in expenditures to benefit the candidate.

(b) Board determination. Upon consideration of the factors described in subdivision (a), the Board may determine by a preponderance of evidence that an expenditure was not independent. Prior to such determination, the candidate and/or the person or entity making the expenditure shall have an opportunity to provide evidence indicating that such expenditure was independent.

(c) Presumed non-independent expenditures. Financing the dissemination, distribution, or republication of any broadcast or any written, graphic, or other form of campaign materials prepared by a candidate is presumed to be a non-independent expenditure, unless the candidate can show that the activity was not in any way undertaken, authorized, requested, suggested, fostered, or otherwise cooperated in by the candidate.

(d) Non-independent expenditures are contributions and expenditures. An expenditure for the purpose of furthering or facilitating the nomination or election of a candidate which is determined not to be an independent expenditure, is a contribution to, and an expenditure by, the candidate.

(e) Expenditures made by party committees or constituted committees. Communication between, or common agents shared by, parties and their nominees will not require a conclusion that all spending by the party's constituted committees and party committees in an election is an in-kind contribution to the nominee.

   (i) The following expenditures made by party committees or constituted committees are not considered in-kind contributions to a candidate unless it is demonstrated that the candidate in some way cooperated in the expenditure and that the expenditure was intended to benefit that candidate:

      (A) materials or activities that promote the party, or oppose another party, by name, platform, principles, history, theme, slogans, issues, or philosophy, without reference to particular candidates in an upcoming election subject to the requirements of the Act.

      (B) materials or activities in connection with candidates and elections not subject to the requirements of the Act.

      (C) training, compensating, or providing materials for poll watchers appointed by the party pursuant to § 8-500 of the New York State Election Law.

      (D) promoting party enrollment or voter turnout without reference to particular candidates in an upcoming election subject to Program requirements, including research, polling, recruitment of party employees and volunteers, and development and maintenance of voter and contributor lists.

      (E) raising funds for the party without reference to particular candidates in an upcoming election subject to the requirements of the Act.

      (F) mailing of absentee ballot applications in a special or general election in which an office not subject to the requirements of the Act is on the ballot.

   (ii) The Board may require a candidate to demonstrate that expenditures made by a party committee or constituted committee for the purpose of furthering or facilitating the nomination or election of a candidate, including expenditures for the purpose of furthering or facilitating the defeat of the nomination or election of such candidate's opponent or prospective opponent, are not in-kind contributions to the candidate.

   (iii) Where a candidate has, without making public disclosure of an outstanding liability in a timely manner, promised or made reimbursement or other payment to a party committee or constituted committee for an expenditure, such expenditure will be considered an in-kind contribution to the candidate during the time preceding the reimbursement or other payment by the candidate.

(f) Running as a "ticket". If candidates announce they are running together as a "ticket" for which they have chosen to join together in a broad spectrum of activities to promote each other's election, the Board will presume that expenditures made by one candidate's campaign for materials or activities that clearly identify the other candidate are in-kind contributions to the second candidate. If the expenditures are in-kind contributions, the expenditures are subject to apportionment requirements as joint expenditures. The following factors would increase the burden a candidate would have in overcoming this presumption:

   (i) the campaigns have staff, consultants, office space, or telephone lines in common; and

   (ii) other in-kind contributions, expenditure refunds, advances, or joint expenditures have been made between these candidates, or one of the candidates has reported a liability owed to the other candidate(s).

(g) Certain routine interactions with entities. Certain routine interactions with entities, absent other indicia of non-independence, will not in themselves lead to a determination of non-independence pursuant to 52 RCNY § 6-04(b), including:

   (i) Discussions of logistics, including scheduling, regarding a non-fundraising event hosted by the entity;

   (ii) Communications directly related to an entity's endorsement process, including questionnaires and interviews; and

   (iii) Requesting, obtaining, or distributing publicly available materials such as a candidate's photograph, biography, position paper, or press release, but not including leaflets, posters, or other similar materials, nor video or audio materials.








*§ 6-05 Expenditures Made by Other Committees Established for the Candidate.* ::


(a) A candidate has the burden of demonstrating that expenditures made by a committee authorized by such candidate for a different election should not be attributed to the covered election.

(b) Failure to meet this burden will result in the application of all Program requirements to these committees for the covered election, including attribution of expenditures to the covered election.

(c) Expenditures for fundraising for more than one election. When a candidate makes expenditures for a single event or other activity to raise funds for more than one office, and the next election that will be held is:

   (i) a covered election, the full amount of such expenditures is subject to the expenditure limit.

   (ii) not a covered election, a portion of such expenditures will be subject to the expenditure limit in the same proportion as the funds raised for the covered election bears to the total funds raised, unless the candidate can demonstrate to the Board that a different apportionment is applicable.








*§ 6-06 Identification of Communications.* ::


(a) "Paid for by". When a candidate makes expenditures for any literature, advertisement, or other communication, the communication must include the words "paid for by" followed by the first and last name of the candidate or the name of the authorized committee that made the expenditures; provided that, if the name of the committee does not include the first or last name of the candidate, the words "paid for by" must be followed by the first and last name of the candidate, either instead of or in addition to the name of the committee.

(b) "Authorized by". When a candidate authorizes any individual or entity, other than the candidate, to pay for any literature, advertisement, or other communication in support of or in opposition to any candidate in any covered election, the communication must include the words "authorized by" followed by the first and last name of the candidate or the name of the candidate's authorized committee; provided that, if the name of the committee does not include the first or last name of the candidate, the words "authorized by" must be followed by the first and last name of the candidate, either instead of or in addition to the name of the committee.

(c) Form. The identification required by subdivision (a) or (b) of this section must be in the following form:

   (i) For printed material, an internet text advertisement, or a website, the identification must be written in a font of conspicuous size and style and contained in a box within the borders of the communication.

   (ii) For an audio communication broadcast on radio or over the internet, the identification must be clearly spoken at the beginning or end of the communication.

   (iii) For a video communication broadcast by television, satellite, cable, internet, or similar medium, the identification must be clearly spoken at the beginning or end of the communication and, simultaneous with the spoken disclosure, written in a font of conspicuous size and style contained in a box within the borders of the communication.

   (iv) For a telephone communication, the identification must be clearly spoken at the beginning or end of the communication. If the identification is spoken at the end of the communication, the name of the candidate must also be clearly spoken at the beginning of the call.

(d) Languages other than English. For communications primarily in a language other than English, all required written or spoken identification required by this section must be in such language.

(e) Where identification would be impractical. This requirement may be modified by the Board concerning items upon which identification would be impractical.








*§ 6-07 Routine Communication Sent by a Political Club to its Members.* ::


A routine communication sent by a political club to its members that includes the name of a candidate is not an in-kind contribution to such candidate, provided that:

(a) the candidate is already a member of the club;

(b) the club has fewer than 500 members; and

(c) the communication does not solicit funds on behalf of or otherwise promote the candidate's campaign for a covered election.

(b) Adjustment. Pursuant to § 3-703(7) of the Code, not later than the first day of March in the year 2018, and every fourth year thereafter, the Board shall adjust the contribution limits. Such adjustment shall be made in accordance with changes in the consumer price index for the metropolitan New York-New Jersey region published by the United States Bureau of Labor Statistics. The adjustment shall be based on the difference between the average consumer price index over the 12 months preceding the calendar year of such adjustment, and either (a) the calendar year preceding the year of the last such adjustment or (b) such other calendar year as may be appropriate pursuant to any amendment to the Act.








*§ 5-02 Solicitation of Contributions.* ::


(a) Fundraising solicitations. Each written solicitation of contributions (including, but not limited to, letters, contribution cards, flyers, and other invitations to contribute or attend events) by or on behalf of a candidate, whether in paper or electronic format, must include the following statement, written in a conspicuous and clearly recognizable manner: "State law prohibits making a contribution in someone else's name, reimbursing someone for a contribution made in your name, being reimbursed for a contribution made in your name, or claiming to have made a contribution when a loan is made." If the solicitation is written in a language other than English, the statement must be written in the same language as the solicitation.

(b) Solicitation of contributions for elections not subject to the Act. If a candidate makes a solicitation for a contribution for an election not subject to the requirements of the Act, the solicitation must specify that the contribution is being solicited for an election that is not subject to the requirements of the Act.








*§ 5-03 Prohibited Contributions and Loans.* ::


(a) Contributions and loans from corporations, limited liability companies, and partnerships, including professional corporations and limited liability partnerships.

(f) Contributions in violation of state or federal law. A candidate may not accept a contribution that was made, received, solicited, or otherwise obtained in violation of any local, state, or federal law.








*§ 5-04 Contributions Subject to Special Requirements.* ::


(a) Contributions from political committees.

   (i) A candidate may accept a contribution from a political committee, provided that the political committee:

      (A) was registered with the Board for the period that includes the candidate's next covered election at the time the contribution was received; or

      (B) registers with the Board within 10 days of receipt of the contribution.

   (ii) A political committee must register in such form and manner as shall be determined by the Board. Such registration shall include but is not limited to:

Candidates have the burden to check the list of registered political committees published by the Board to ensure that each political committee contribution accepted is from a registered committee.

   (iv) The registration shall remain in effect through the end of the election cycle, unless there has been a material change in the information included in the registration.

   (v) Political committees that do not submit the information required by the Board, or any required signatures or notarizations, will not be considered to be registered.

   (vi) Earmarked contributions from political committees.

      (A) A candidate may accept a contribution given to a political committee by a contributor who limited the committee's choice or directed the selection of the recipient, but the contribution shall be considered to be from both the original contributor and from the political committee.

      (B) A contribution that a political committee has received solely because of its actions as an intermediary as defined in these rules is not an earmarked contribution.

      (C) A nominee contribution is not an earmarked contribution.

   (i) the decision to contribute was made knowingly and voluntarily by the minor;

   (ii) If a check or other monetary instrument representing a joint contribution, or a contribution card or other contemporaneous document related to the contribution, does not indicate the amount to be attributed to each contributor, the contribution shall be attributed equally to each contributor.

(d) Post-election contributions. Contributions accepted after an election may be used to pay liabilities incurred in that election, subject to the applicable contribution limit and prohibitions, only if deposited in and disbursed from an account established and maintained for that election, as provided in 52 RCNY § 5-11(a)(iii) and (iv).

(e) Text message contributions. A text message contribution is received on the date it is delivered to the candidate, after payment of the contributor's wireless bill, by a wireless carrier or other mobile fundraising vendor.








*§ 5-05 Non-matchable Contributions.* ::


The following are not matchable:

(a) In-kind contributions and loans. In-kind contributions and loans, regardless of whether such loans are considered contributions pursuant to § 3-702(8) of the Code.

(b) Purchase price. Contributions in the form of the purchase price paid for an item with significant intrinsic and enduring value, or paid for or otherwise induced by a chance to participate in a raffle, lottery, or a similar drawing for valuable prizes.

(c) Certain contributions from vendors. Contributions from individuals, other than employees of the candidate's principal committee, who are vendors to the committee or individuals who have an interest in a vendor to the committee, unless the expenditure to the vendor is reimbursement for an advance. For the purposes of this subdivision, "individuals who have an interest in a vendor" means individuals having an ownership interest of 10% or more in a vendor or control over the vendor. An individual shall be deemed to have control over the vendor firm if the individual holds a management position, such as the position of officer, director or trustee.

(d) Doing business, lobbyist, and lobbyist-related contributions. Contributions from individuals having business dealings with the city as defined in § 3-702(18) of the Code, and contributions from lobbyists as defined in § 3-211 of the Code, or persons required to be included in a statement of registration filed pursuant to §§ 3-213(c)(1) or 3-213(d) of the Code.

   (ii) any other information that suggests that matchable contribution claims may be invalid; and

   (iii) arithmetical errors in totals reported.








*§ 5-06 In-kind Contributions.* ::


(a) An in-kind contribution is an expenditure. An in-kind contribution to a candidate's authorized committee is also considered an expenditure made by such committee, and the amount of the in-kind contribution thus counts toward the candidate's contribution and expenditure limits. An in-kind contribution is received on the date the goods or services are received or rendered, which is presumed to be the date of the associated expenditure, unless the candidate provides evidence to demonstrate that the contribution should be deemed received on a different date.

(b) The value of an in-kind contribution.

   (i) Candidates must maintain invoices or other written records supporting the valuation of all in-kind contributions.

   (ii) If no invoice is available and obtaining an invoice is not practicable, a candidate must use a reasonable estimate of value in documenting the fair market value of an in-kind contribution.

      (A) The fair market value of goods is the price of those goods in the market from which they ordinarily would have been purchased when the goods were received.

      (B) The fair market value of services is the hourly or piecework charge for the services at a commercially reasonable rate prevailing when the services were rendered.

(c) Good or service purchased below fair market value. Where goods or services are purchased by a candidate for less than fair market value, the difference between the fair market value when they were received, including any applicable tax, and the amount charged to the candidate is an in-kind contribution.

(d) Extension of credit that is not commercially reasonable is an in-kind contribution.

   (i) Generally. A creditor that extends credit to a candidate for a period beyond 90 days has made a contribution equal in value to the credit extended, unless the creditor is making a commercially reasonable attempt to collect the debt.

   (ii) Prohibited in-kind contribution. Extension of credit by a corporation, limited liability company, or partnership that is not commercially reasonable and is not made in the regular course of business is presumed to be a prohibited in-kind contribution.

(e) Debt forgiven is an in-kind contribution.

   (i) Generally. A debt owed by a candidate, which is forgiven or settled for less than the amount owed, is an in-kind contribution, unless the debt was forgiven or settled by the creditor in a commercially reasonable manner.

   (ii) Commercially reasonable treatment of debts. The Board will consider as evidence of commercially reasonable treatment that: (A) all commercially reasonable efforts have been taken to satisfy the outstanding debt; and (B) the creditor has pursued its remedies in the same manner as that customarily employed by creditors of other debtors.

   (iii) Advances. An advance is considered to be an in-kind contribution from the individual or entity making the advance until it has been reimbursed by the candidate, and a candidate may not accept an advance from a prohibited source.

(f) Failing to report a liability leads to a presumption of an in-kind contribution. An outstanding liability not contemporaneously reported as outstanding by a candidate may be presumed to be an in-kind contribution to the candidate, if other indicia of a contribution exist.








*§ 5-07 Refunding Prohibited and Over-the-Limit Contributions.* ::


(a) Generally. When a candidate knows or has reason to know that such candidate has accepted a contribution or aggregate contributions from a single source in excess of the applicable contribution limit, including a contribution or contributions from a contributor having business dealings with the city, or from a source prohibited by the Act or the Charter or by state or federal law, the candidate must promptly refund the excess portion or prohibited contribution by bank or certified check made out to the contributor or to the Fund; provided, however, that when a candidate knows or has reason to know that such candidate has accepted a nominee or anonymous contribution, the candidate must promptly disgorge the amount of such contribution by bank or certified check made out to the comptroller of the state of New York for deposit in the general treasury of the state.

(b) Contribution refunds must be timely.

   (i) When a candidate knows or has reason to know that such candidate has accepted a prohibited or over-the-limit contribution, the candidate must return or refund the contribution, or the over-the-limit portion thereof, on or before the next disclosure statement filing deadline or the deadline set by the Board.

   (ii) When a candidate is notified by the Board that such candidate has accepted a prohibited or over-the-limit contribution, the candidate must return the contribution by the date specified in the notice sent by the Board.

(c) Contribution refunds must be documented and reported. If a candidate issues a refund for a contribution after it has been deposited in the committee's account, the contribution and corresponding refund must be documented and reported to the Board.

(d) Restrictions on return. After receiving public funds for an election, a candidate may not return a contribution, unless directed by the Board to do so, until any required repayments to the Fund have been made, except if the contribution: (i) exceeds the contribution limit, including the limit applicable to contributors having business dealings with the city, (ii) is otherwise illegal, (iii) is returned because of the candidate's reputational interest in light of the particular source or intermediary involved, or (iv) was deposited in a separate account pursuant to 52 RCNY § 16-06 for a runoff election that is not held.

(e) Where refund is impracticable. If a timely refund of a contribution to the contributor is impracticable, the candidate may pay the Fund an amount equal to the amount of the refund.

(f) Over-the-limit contributions from contributors doing business with the city.

   (i) When a candidate reports an over-the-limit contribution from a contributor having business dealings with the city:

      (A) The Board will provide such notification to the candidate within 20 days of the reporting of the contribution; provided, however, that if such twentieth day is a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday, notification by the Board on the next business day shall be considered timely. In the case of a contribution reported during the six weeks preceding the candidate's next covered election, the Board shall provide such notification within three business days.

      (B) The candidate must:

         (1) refund the excess portion of the contribution within 20 days of the date of the notice; or

         (2) demonstrate to the Board, within 20 days of notification, that the contributor identified by the Board as having business dealings with the city has applied to the Mayor's Office of Contract Services for removal from the doing business database and that such application is pending.

      (C) For purposes of calculating compliance with the limits applicable to contributors having business dealings with the city, contributions accepted from a contributor who appears on the doing business database shall be aggregated with all other contributions accepted from such contributor during the same election cycle; provided, however, that contributions accepted while the contributor did not appear on such database shall not be required to be refunded pursuant to this section.

   (ii) Where a contributor has made an application for removal from the doing business database, the candidate may retain any contribution received from the contributor until the Board notifies the candidate that the Mayor's Office of Contract Services has denied the application for removal, in which case the candidate shall have 20 days from the date of such second notice to refund the excess portion of the contribution.

   (iii) Contributions from or intermediated by individuals who have applied for removal from the doing business database shall not be considered matchable unless and until the contributor or intermediary is removed from the doing business database.








*§ 5-08 Contributions Originally Received for Other Elections.* ::


(a) Transfers.

   (i) Generally. Notwithstanding 52 RCNY § 5-11(a), participants may transfer funds previously received for another election to the principal committee. Additionally, participants may transfer funds from the principal committee to another authorized committee, after all excess funds have been returned to the Board as provided by 52 RCNY § 5-11(c)(ii) and 52 RCNY § 9-02(c).

   (ii) Segregated accounts. Notwithstanding paragraph (i) of this subdivision, if a candidate has funds remaining in a segregated account after the election for which the account was established, such funds must be refunded to the contributors or paid to the Fund, or used to pay outstanding liabilities related to such election. Such funds may not be transferred into any other account or used for any future election.

(b) Surplus funds. The cash balance reported in a non-participant's first semi-annual Board disclosure statement at the beginning of the first reporting period for an election is the total amount of surplus funds the committee had from a previous election; except that the amount deemed to be surplus funds may be reduced by the following:

   (i) the total amount of debts and obligations outstanding at the beginning of the reporting period;

   (ii) the total amount subsequently transferred to a political committee that is not involved in a covered election; and

   (iii) if the candidate was a participant in the previous election, the total amount of public funds subsequently repaid.

(c) Additional requirements for transfers and surplus funds.

   (i) Candidates have the burden of demonstrating that surplus funds and transfers of funds from committees not otherwise involved in the covered election do not derive from:

      (A) contributions in excess of the Act's contribution limits, including contributions that would exceed the Act's contribution limits when aggregated with other contributions accepted from the same source; or

      (B) contributions from sources prohibited by the Act, the Charter, or state or federal law.

   (ii) Participants have the burden of demonstrating that funds transferred from a committee, other than another authorized committee of the same candidate that has filed contemporaneous disclosure statements with the Board in a timely manner, derive solely from contributions for which records demonstrating the contributors' intent to designate the contributions for the covered election have been submitted and maintained as required pursuant to 52 RCNY §§ 4-05(c)(vi) and 4-01(b)(ii)(D), respectively.

   (iii) For purposes of enforcing the contribution limit and contribution prohibitions, the Board shall attribute surplus funds and such transfers to the last monetary contributions, loans, and other receipts received by:

      (A) the candidate on or before the date of the cash balance described in subdivision (b), in the case of surplus funds; or

      (B) the transferor committee before making the transfer.

   (iv) For any prohibited or over-the-limit contribution, the candidate must either:

      (A) promptly refund the excess portion or amount of the prohibited contribution, or

      (B) keep the excess portion or amount of the prohibited contribution in the transferor committee bank account, not to be used in a covered election.

(d) Related expenditures. Expenditures incurred in connection with raising or administering funds transferred from a committee not otherwise involved in a covered election, other than from another principal committee of the same candidate, are presumed to be subject to the expenditure limits of the Act. Participants have the burden of demonstrating that any such expenditures are not subject to the expenditure limits of the Act, as provided in 52 RCNY § 6-01(j).








*§ 5-09 Loans.* ::


(a) Deposit. All loans must be accepted and deposited, or rejected and returned, within 10 business days after receipt.

(b) Loans over $100 may not be made by cash or credit card.

(c) Loans forgiven. Any portion of a loan that is forgiven is a monetary contribution from the source of the loan, subject to the contribution limits and prohibitions.

(d) Third party repayment of loan. If any portion of a loan is repaid by an individual or entity other than the committee that received the loan, the portion thus repaid is a contribution by that individual or entity.

(e) Repayment by next election. If a loan is not repaid by the date of the next election in which the candidate appears on the ballot, the loan, guarantee, or other security for the loan will be considered a contribution subject to the Act's contribution limits and prohibitions.

(f) Loans made in regular course of business. A loan made in the regular course of the lender's business shall be deemed, to the extent not repaid by the date of the next election in which the candidate appears on the ballot, a contribution by the lender and by any other individual or entity endorsing, cosigning, guaranteeing, collateralizing, or otherwise providing security for the loan.

(g) Loans not made in regular course of business. A loan not made in the regular course of the lender's business shall be deemed, to the extent not repaid by the date of the next election in which the candidate appears on the ballot, a contribution by the lender.

(h) Attributing a loan to an election. A loan is presumed to be accepted for the next election in which the candidate seeks nomination or election following the day that the loan is received, except as otherwise provided in 52 RCNY § 5-09(i), and except that:

   (i) in the case of a state or local election, loans received before the first January 12 after an election will be presumed to be accepted for that election; and

   (ii) in the case of a federal election, loans received before the first January 1 after the election will be presumed to be accepted for that election, except as may otherwise be provided under federal law and regulations.

(i) Post-election loans.

   (i) Loans received after an election are considered contributions attributed to the previous election, and may be used for such election as provided in this section.

   (ii) Loans received after an election must be deposited in the committee bank account for that election.

   (iii) A loan to a candidate's principal committee made from such candidate's personal funds, after a final determination of the Board has been issued with respect to such committee, for the purpose of paying penalties or making required repayments to the Fund pursuant to such determination, is not subject to the contribution limit, even if such loan is subsequently forgiven by such candidate.








*§ 5-10 Attributing Contributions.* ::


(a) Attributing a contribution to an election. A contribution is presumed to be accepted for the first covered election in which the candidate seeks nomination or election following the day that the contribution is received, unless the contribution was properly transferred to the committee from another committee of the candidate for a different election, and except that:

   (i) in the case of a state or local election, contributions received before the first January 12 after the election will be presumed to be accepted for that election; and

   (ii) in the case of a federal election, contributions received before the first January 1 after the election will be presumed to be accepted for that election, except as may otherwise be provided under federal law and regulations.

(b) Attributing multiple contributions to a single source and contribution limit.

   (i) Multiple contributions from a single source will be totaled to determine the candidate's compliance with the applicable contribution limits.

   (ii) General factors for determining a "single source." Factors for determining whether an individual, individuals in combination, entity, or entities in combination establish, maintain, or control another entity include, but are not limited to:

      (A) whether the persons or entities make decisions or establish policy for the other entity, including determinations of the recipients of its contributions and the purposes of its expenditures;

      (B) whether the persons or entities have the authority to hire, appoint, discipline, discharge, demote, remove, or otherwise influence other persons who make decisions or establish policies for the other entity;

      (C) whether contributions made by the persons or entities and the other entity reflect a similar pattern; and

      (D) whether the persons or entities know of and have acquiesced in public representations by the other entity that it is acting on their behalf or under their direction.

   (iii) Attributing single source contributions from labor organizations. Notwithstanding paragraph (i), different labor organizations shall not be considered to be a single source for the purpose of compliance with the applicable contribution limit if the candidate demonstrates that the contributors satisfy the four criteria below:

      (A) the labor organizations do not share a majority of members of their governing boards;

      (B) the labor organizations do not share a majority of the officers of their governing boards;

      (C) the labor organizations maintain separate accounts with different signatories; and

      (D) the labor organizations make contributions from separate accounts.

   (iv) Attributing single source "doing business" contributions. If a candidate accepts multiple contributions from a single source consisting of at least one contribution from an individual having business dealings with the city and one or more contributions from an entity established, maintained, or controlled by that individual, the limit applicable to persons having business dealings with the city shall apply.

   (v) Burden is on the candidate. If multiple contributions appear to be from a single source in excess of the contribution limit, the candidate has the burden of demonstrating that they are from different sources. Candidates must review the relationship between contributors who appear to constitute a single source before accepting and depositing contributions.

(c) Attributing contribution amount for fundraiser ticket or fundraising item.

   (i) Fundraiser ticket. When attendees purchase entrance to a fundraiser, the entire amount paid to attend a fundraising event is a contribution.

   (ii) Fundraising item. When an individual buys an item sold by a candidate to raise funds, the entire amount paid as the purchase price for such item is a contribution.








*§ 5-11 Use of Receipts.* ::


(a) Bank accounts.

   (i) Candidates must maintain a committee account with check writing privileges. Checks issued from such account must be signed by the candidate or an individual so authorized by the candidate.

   (ii) Candidates must maintain a bank account in the name of the principal or authorized committee. Such bank account:

      (A) must be used for the deposit of receipts, including public funds, and the making of expenditures, for the covered election;

      (B) must be used exclusively for the purpose of furthering the candidate's nomination or election in the covered election, and for post-election expenditures as provided in subdivision (c) of this section; and

      (C) must not contain personal, business, or other non-campaign funds.

   (iii) Receipts accepted by a participant for one election may not be commingled in an account with receipts accepted for another election, with receipts accepted for a TIE, or with personal or business funds. Notwithstanding the foregoing, participants:

      (A) may use one account for both the primary and general election in the same calendar year;

      (B) may open a segregated account pursuant to 52 RCNY § 7-07(b);

      (C) must use a court-ordered rerun account for public funds received for a court-ordered rerun election; and

      (D) must use a merchant account for the purpose of accepting credit card contributions pursuant to 52 RCNY § 4-01(b)(ii)(A)(4)(II).

   (iv) Separate accounts for different elections. A candidate seeking election both to an office subject to the Act and to a state or federal office may maintain a separate allocation account for shared expenses in accordance with Advisory Opinion No. 1996-2 .

   (v) Deposit of receipts. All monetary contributions must be accepted and deposited into the account(s) listed on the candidate's Filer Registration or Certification and in disclosure statements filed with the Board, or rejected and returned to a contributor, within 20 business days after receipt, except contributions made in the form of cash must be accepted and deposited, or rejected and returned to a contributor, within 10 business days after receipt. All monetary receipts accepted for an election must be deposited into the candidate's authorized committee bank account. A monetary receipt is received on the date it is delivered to the candidate.

(b) Receipts may be used only to further a candidate's nomination or election. A candidate may use receipts only for the covered election for which that account was established or an associated runoff election.

   (i) Expenditures not in furtherance of the campaign. In determining whether or not an expenditure is in furtherance of a candidate's nomination or election, the Board may consider the factors from the following non-exhaustive list:

      (A) the timing of the expenditure;

      (B) whether the candidate has already purchased duplicative services or equipment;

      (C) the nature of the goods or services purchased;

      (D) whether an unusually high proportion of funds was spent on a specific category of expenditure;

      (E) whether a high total dollar amount or proportion of payments was made to individuals rather than to entities;

      (F) whether the candidate has demonstrated a pattern of making other expenditures not in furtherance of the campaign or impermissible post-election expenditures; and

      (G) whether an expenditure made less than one month prior to the election, or after the election, is accompanied by the reporting of a corresponding outstanding liability.

(c) Post-election use of receipts.

   (i) After the last day of the final reporting period of a covered election, a candidate in that election may not expend, transfer, or use receipts accepted for another election, unless the receipts have been deposited in and are disbursed from a separate account, as provided in 52 RCNY § 5-11(a)(iii) and (iv). Funds accepted and separately deposited for the previous election may be transferred to this account only after any required repayments to the Fund have been made and any fines or civil penalties assessed pursuant to the Act have been paid. Contributions and loans accepted for the previous election after such election are subject to 52 RCNY §§ 5-04(d) and 5-09(i).

   (ii) A participant may not use receipts for any purpose other than disbursements in the preceding election until all unspent campaign funds have been repaid, except as otherwise provided in subparagraph (i) of this paragraph and 52 RCNY § 5-07(d). Notwithstanding the presumption of 52 RCNY § 6-01(h)(i), a participant has the burden of demonstrating that a post-election expenditure is for the preceding election.








*§ 5-12 Court Ordered Rerun Elections.* ::


(a) No contributions may be accepted until court contest has begun. A candidate may not accept contributions for a court-ordered rerun election until a complaint has been filed in a court of competent jurisdiction concerning the canvass of returns or the conduct of the election.

(b) Where rerun election is canceled, contributions must be reasonably related to expenditures. If a rerun election is ordered by a court but subsequently canceled, a candidate who would have been on the ballot has the burden of demonstrating that any portion of contributions raised may be reasonably attributed to expenses incurred for the rerun election before its cancellation.

--------------------------------------------------



*§ 8-01 Payment Determinations.* ::


(a) Candidates who fail to demonstrate compliance with the Act and these rules, including candidates who satisfy one or more criteria for ineligibility as provided in 52 RCNY § 3-01(d), are not eligible to receive a post-election public funds payment.

(b) Candidates have the burden of demonstrating eligibility to retain public funds received prior to the election and to receive additional public funds after the election. Candidates who fail to demonstrate eligibility to retain all or a portion of the public funds previously received may be required to repay such amount to the Fund.

(c) A candidate's post-election payment, if any, will be reduced by the amount of any applicable deductions pursuant to 52 RCNY § 7-07(a), if such amounts were not deducted from pre-election public funds payments.

(d) The post-election payment, repayment, or nonpayment determination shall be the final determination regarding that candidate's public funds payment status, except as provided in 52 RCNY § 8-05.








*§ 8-02 Amount of Post-Election Payment.* ::


(a) Reasons for post-election payment. A post-election payment shall only be made if, at the conclusion of the post-election audit, a candidate has demonstrated unpaid matching claims, a qualified expenditure surplus, and documented outstanding liabilities.

   (i) Unpaid matching claims. Candidates may be entitled to receive a post-election payment equal to the amount by which the candidate's total valid matchable claims multiplied by the applicable matching rate pursuant to § 3-705(2)(a) of the Code exceed the total pre-election payments received by the candidate.

   (ii) Qualified expenditure surplus. Candidates may be entitled to receive a post-election payment equal to the amount by which the candidate's total qualified expenditures exceed the total pre-election payments received by the candidate.

   (iii) Documented outstanding liabilities. Candidates may be entitled to receive a post-election payment equal to the amount of the candidate's properly reported and documented liabilities that remain outstanding, less the amount remaining in the candidate's principal committee bank account.

      (A) Prior to issuing a post-election payment, the Board may require the candidate to submit any bank statements not previously provided.

      (B) In order to be the basis for a post-election payment, an outstanding liability must be reported on or before the due date for the final disclosure statement required to be submitted for the covered election to which the liability relates.

      (C) To document an outstanding liability for the purpose of receiving a post-election payment, the candidate must provide documentation demonstrating that the reported payee has made a commercially reasonable attempt to collect the debt.

   (iv) Post-election payment is smallest amount. The amount of the post-election payment shall be the lowest of the three amounts detailed in paragraphs (i), (ii), and (iii) of this subdivision. If any of these amounts is zero, the candidate is not entitled to receive a post-election public funds payment.

(b) Statutory maximum. Combined with the total pre-election payments received by the candidate, the post-election payment shall not exceed the maximum payment allowed for each election in which the candidate was a participant pursuant to § 3-705(2)(b) of the Code.








*§ 8-03 Use of Final Post-Election Payment.* ::


Before the Board makes the final post-election payment determination, if eligible, the candidate must submit to the Board bills or other documentation of outstanding debt for which such payment will be used. Within 60 days after the final public funds payment, the candidate must demonstrate that the public funds were used to pay such outstanding debt. If such demonstration is not made, the candidate must repay the public funds to the Board.








*§ 8-04 Disclosure Statement Amendments.* ::


The Board shall not make payments based on disclosure statement amendments filed after January 15 in the year following the year of the election; provided, however, that the Board may make payments based upon such amendments solely if they are made in response to invalid matching claims reports or expenditure sample reports to which the Board has requested a response after January 15 in the year following the year of the election.








*§ 8-05 Post-Election Petitions for Review.* ::


(a) After the Board provides a candidate a written determination specifying the basis for payment or non-payment of public funds after the election, the candidate may petition the Board in writing for reconsideration of such determination.

(b) A petition for review of a post-election payment determination must be submitted within 30 days of the candidate's final audit report, and must include:

   (i) a statement of the grounds for reconsideration;

   (ii) information or documentation that was unavailable to the Board previously and is material to such determination;

   (iii) a showing that the candidate had good cause for the previous failure to provide such information or documentation; and

   (iv) either a request to appear before the Board concerning the petition or a statement that the candidate waives such candidate's right to appear.

(c) The Board shall timely issue a written determination on the subject of the petition. If the petition is denied, the determination shall inform the candidate of the right to appeal such determination pursuant to Article 78 of the Civil Practice Law and Rules.






Title 52: Campaign Finance Board*
--------------------------------------------------



*§ 7-01 Eligibility.* ::


(a) A determination that a candidate has met all eligibility requirements of the Act and these rules, as of the date on which payment is to be made, shall not constitute the Board's final determination of the amount, if any, for which the candidate qualifies. The Board shall provide specific notice of any such final determination.

(b) Failure to respond to a request for audit documentation or information by the Board may be a basis for a non-payment determination.

(c) Payment amount. A candidate in any covered primary, general, or special election, having demonstrated eligibility to receive public funds, including by meeting the threshold for eligibility for public funding pursuant to § 3-703(2) of the Code, may receive public matching funds based on valid matchable contribution claims and the matching rate set forth in § 3-705(2)(a) of the Code, up to the maximum amount set forth in § 3-705(2)(b) or § 3-705(7) of the Code, as applicable. Payments are subject to withholdings and deductions as set forth in the Act and these rules.

(d) Approval by Board subject to correction of limited, isolated, and easily corrected compliance issues. The Board may, at its discretion, approve a public funds payment to a candidate, notwithstanding limited, isolated, and easily corrected compliance issues, conditioned upon a demonstration by the candidate that such candidate has taken the action specified by the Board, by the deadline specified by the Board, to correct the compliance issues. The candidate shall have the burden of demonstrating to the Board that such candidate has taken the action specified by the Board by the applicable deadline.

(e) Ballot disqualification; unopposed candidates. Pursuant to § 3-703(1)(a) and (5) of the Code, the Board will not make payment to any candidate disqualified from the ballot by the Board of Elections or by a court, or to any candidate for an election in which all other candidates have been disqualified from the ballot by the Board of Elections or by a court, until such candidate or other candidate is restored to the ballot by a court of competent jurisdiction. A candidate who appears as the only candidate on the ballot in an election shall not be eligible to receive public funds, notwithstanding any write-in candidates in that election, except as otherwise provided in paragraph (ii) below.

   (i) The Board will consider a candidate to be finally disqualified from the ballot on the earlier of the date of an administrative or judicial determination disqualifying the candidate for which there is no appeal as of right (unless the disqualification is reversed on appeal or otherwise) or of the election.

   (ii) Payment petition. Payment may be made to a candidate who was temporarily on the ballot or opposed in an election, pursuant to a determination of the Board of Elections or a court of competent jurisdiction, but then ultimately disqualified from the ballot or unopposed in that election, only when the Board's audit of the candidate's campaign has been completed and only if the candidate has, within 30 days after the date of the final disqualification, as provided herein, filed a written petition, sworn to or affirmed, and supporting documentation that demonstrates that: (1) liabilities in qualified campaign expenditures incurred before the date of final disqualification remain unpaid; (2) the total amount of cash on hand is insufficient to pay these liabilities; (3) all expenditures made and liabilities incurred after the final disqualification were reasonable and necessary; and (4) the candidate was otherwise eligible and in compliance with all other Program requirements as of the date of final disqualification and has remained in compliance at all times since that date. The petition must also include an undertaking to use all public funds received to extinguish the liabilities enumerated pursuant to subparagraph (1) of this paragraph.

(f) Write-in candidates. A candidate who is seeking election exclusively as a write-in candidate, or who is only opposed by a candidate who is seeking election exclusively as a write-in candidate, is not eligible to receive public funds.








*§ 7-02 Timing.* ::


(a) Three payment dates in the 30 days prior to an election. The Board shall schedule at least three payment dates in the 30 days prior to a covered primary, general, or special election.

   (i) No public funds shall be paid to candidates in a primary or general election any earlier than four business days after the final day to file a written Certification for such election pursuant to paragraph (c) of subdivision 1 of § 3-703 of the Code.

   (ii) Pursuant to §§ 3-703(1)(a) and (5) of the Code, public funds are not payable to a participant who has not met the legal requirements to have such participant's name on the ballot, who is unopposed, or, for the optional early public funds payment, who has not certified that such participant intends to meet all the requirements of law to have such participant's name on the ballot and stated the specific office to which such participant is seeking nomination or election.

(b) Preliminary review of disclosure statements; reasons for delay. In order to enable payment within four business days after receipt of disclosure statements, or as soon thereafter as is practicable, pursuant to § 3-705(4) of the Code, the Board shall conduct a preliminary review of all disclosure statements filed.

   (i) If a candidate's complete disclosure statement is not actually received by 5:00 p.m. on the due date, or if the candidate submits a disclosure statement that fails to comply substantially with the requirements of the Act or these rules, the Board may be unable to make payment within four business days, and may review the disclosure statement for possible payment determinations at the next payment date.

   (ii) A preliminary review may also be delayed for reasons including, but not limited to, consideration of whether a basis exists for an ineligibility determination. A delayed preliminary review may result in a payment determination being delayed until such time as it is practicable.

(c) Preliminary review of matching claims. Prior to making a pre-election payment determination, the Board may issue a report to the candidate indicating any matching claims determined to be invalid based on preliminary review of each disclosure statement and of the matchable contribution claims reported therein. The candidate may respond to such report by providing information or documentation demonstrating that any such matching claims should be considered valid. Failure by the candidate to respond to such report by the deadline set by the Board may result in a delay in payment of public matching funds.

(d) Characterization of payments as for the primary or general election.

   (i) If a participant is on the ballot and has an opponent on the ballot in both a primary and the general elections, payments made after the primary election will be characterized initially as follows:

      (A) As a primary election payment, if the payment is made on the basis of contribution and expenditure information reported in or before the disclosure statement due 10 days after the primary election, except as otherwise provided in subparagraph (B).

      (B) As a general election payment, to the extent that any further primary election payments would exceed a maximum applicable in the primary election pursuant to the Act.

      (C) As a general election payment, if the payment is made on the basis of contribution and expenditure information reported in disclosure statements due later than 10 days after the primary election.

   (ii) If the Board determines that payments characterized initially as either primary or general election payments were, in fact, used for qualified campaign expenditures incurred in the other election, the payments will be recharacterized accordingly, and additional payments may be made or repayments required, if appropriate.








*§ 7-03 Payment by Electronic Funds Transfer.* ::


All payments of public funds shall be by electronic funds transfer unless the Board determines, at its sole discretion, to use an alternative payment method. In order to receive prompt payment, the participating candidate must provide the Board with a voided committee check and such additional information as shall be required by the Board.








*§ 7-04 Public Funds Cap.* ::


(a) Pursuant to § 3-705(7)(a)(1) of the Code, a candidate shall not be eligible to receive more than one quarter of the applicable maximum pursuant to § 3-705(2)(b) of the Code unless the candidate submits a certified signed statement attesting to, and stating the reason for, such candidate's need for additional public funds. The statement of need must be filed with the Board no later than the due date for the applicable disclosure statements as follows, except that, if the basis for filing the statement of need arises after such due date, and no such basis existed prior to such due date, then the statement of need shall be due by the deadline for the disclosure statement immediately preceding the next date on which a public funds payment is to be made:

   (i) Candidates in the primary election must file the statement of need no later than the due date for the 32-day pre-primary election disclosure statement.

   (ii) Candidates in the general election must file the statement of need no later than the due date for the 32-day pre-general election disclosure statement.

(b) The Board shall verify the truthfulness of any certified signed statement submitted pursuant to § 3-705(7)(a)(1) of the Code and determine whether supporting documentation demonstrates the existence of the condition or conditions described in such statement. For the purposes of making a determination pursuant to § 3-705(7)(a)(1)(A) of the Code, a non-participating candidate shall be presumed to have the ability to self-finance when it is demonstrated through supporting documentation that such candidate has readily available funds in excess of one fifth of the applicable expenditure limit and that such candidate can reasonably be expected to spend such funds for such candidate's election.








*§ 7-05 Small Primaries.* ::


(a) A candidate on the ballot in one or more primary election(s) in which the number of persons eligible to vote for party nominees in each such election totals fewer than 1,000 shall not receive public funds in excess of $5,000 for qualified campaign expenditures in such election or elections; provided, however, that the foregoing limitation shall not apply to such candidate if the candidate is opposed in a primary election by (i) a participant who is not subject to such limitation or (ii) a non-participant who has spent or contracted or become obligated to spend in excess of $10,000 for such primary election. The Board shall determine whether a non-participant has exceeded such $10,000 level pursuant to § 3-705(6) of the Code.

(b) For the purposes of subdivision (a), the number of persons eligible to vote for party nominees in a primary election shall be as determined by the Board of Elections for the calendar year of the primary election pursuant to § 5-604 of the New York State Election Law. If such determination for any primary election is not available from the Board of Elections as of the day before the due date for filing a Certification pursuant to § 3-703(1)(c) of the Code, the most recent determination by the Board of Elections of the persons eligible to vote for party nominees for the office for which such primary election is held shall be relied upon.








*§ 7-06 Withholdings.* ::


The Board may withhold up to 5% of the amount of public funds payable to a candidate until the final pre-election payment for any election in which the candidate is eligible to receive public funds. In addition, the Board may withhold from pre-election public funds payments: (a) a percentage equal to the projected rate of invalid matching claims; and (b) up to an additional 5% if the Board determines that there is reason to believe that the candidate has failed to comply with the Act, including by failing to adequately respond to a Board request for information or documentation. Such withholdings shall be subject to post-election audit.








*§ 7-07 Deductions from Payments.* ::


(a) The total amount of public funds payable to a participant for a covered primary, general, or special election shall be reduced by the sum of the following:

   (i) the amount of outstanding civil penalties assessed by the Board as a result of the participant's failure to comply with the Act and these rules during the current covered election; and

   (ii) the amount of the participant's:

      (A) transfers and other disbursements from a political committee that is involved in an election in which the candidate is currently a participant, to a political committee that is not involved in that election;

      (E) loans to or spending for political party committees and political clubs that are not reimbursed within 30 days or by the date of the election, whichever is earlier, provided that if the candidate demonstrates that the expenditure was for a tangible item that directly promotes the candidate's election, such as an advertisement in a fundraising journal, this subparagraph shall not apply to the fair market value of that item; and

      (F) expenditures made for the purpose of furthering the candidate's election to the position of Speaker of the City Council.

(b) Disbursements that would otherwise result in a deduction pursuant to paragraph (ii) of subdivision (a) of this section shall not result in any such deduction if:

   (vii) a copy of each bank statement for the segregated bank account is submitted to the Board by the due date for the next disclosure statement; and

   (viii) for each individual contribution deposited into the segregated bank account, and each disbursement out of the segregated bank account, the candidate has complied with all other applicable provisions of the Act and these rules, including but not limited to the record keeping and reporting provisions.

(c) Candidates must deposit the entire amount of a contribution into the segregated bank account provided for in subdivision (b), and may not divide the contribution between different accounts.

(d) Contributions deposited into a segregated bank account pursuant to this section will not be matched with public funds.

The Board may find that a candidate's registration and financial disclosure submitted to the Board or to the State Board of Elections provide on their face a sufficient basis for a determination of the amount such candidate has spent or contracted or become obligated to spend, or received in loans or contributions. The Board will presume that contributions and loans are accepted, disbursements are made, and liabilities are incurred by a candidate for such candidate's next election. In the absence of contrary evidence, the Board will rely upon the date of contributions, loans, disbursements, and liabilities as they appear on disclosure statements filed with the Board or the State Board of Elections.

(b) Petitions for reconsideration.

   (i) Contents. A candidate may file a petition for reconsideration of a preliminary Board determination made pursuant to subdivision (a). Such petition must be written and must:

      (A) be sworn to or affirmed;

      (B) indicate on whose behalf the petition is being submitted;

      (C) contain sufficient specificity and detail for the Board to make a decision, including:

         (1) if alleging that information submitted to the Board or the State Board of Elections is inaccurate or incomplete, the petition must describe the inaccuracies or omissions in detail, or the Board may presume that any information on file is true and complete;

         (2) if alleging fundraising or spending activities to have taken place after the close of a reporting period, the petition must describe the activities in detail;

         (3) if alleging that a third party is providing unreported contributions, goods, services, or benefits to a candidate in coordination with that candidate, the petition must include all relevant names, dates, and amounts, including information concerning the fair market value of services, materials, facilities, advertising, or other things of value reported to have been received or expended; and

         (4) if alleging that statements have been made, the petition must include content of statements, name, dates, how speaker is affiliated with a candidate or other actor, and any other relevant information.

      (D) include a request for a hearing, if desired;

      (E) be submitted no later than 10 days after the determination or decision; and

      (F) be accompanied by evidence that supports the allegations made in the petition. The petitioner has the burden of demonstrating a sufficient basis for a determination.

   (ii) Notice of petition.

      (A) The Board shall send a copy of the petition to any opposing entities named in the petition or known by the Board to have an opposing interest in the petition.

      (B) The notice shall specify:

         (1) the deadline for the opposing entities to submit a response; and

         (2) the date and time at which the Board will conduct a hearing on the petition, if any.

   (iii) Response to the petition. The opposing entities may submit a response to the petition. A failure to submit a response may be deemed an admission of the allegations in the petition and sufficient reason to deny a request to reconsider any determination based on the petition. The response must:

      (A) be submitted in the manner and by the deadline set forth by the Board;

      (B) be sworn to or affirmed;

      (C) either acknowledge that fundraising or spending on behalf of the respondent is sufficient to permit the Board to make a determination, regardless of the merit of the petitioning candidate's particular allegations, or contend that a determination would be inappropriate and specify the allegations in the petition that are denied and those that are admitted;

      (D) explain any failure to disclose any information to the Board or the City or State Board of Elections;

      (E) include evidence that supports the response, including, but not limited to, all relevant names, dates, and amounts, including information concerning the fair market value of services, materials, facilities, advertising, or other things of value reported to have been received or expended;

      (F) include a request for a hearing, if desired; and

      (G) be signed by the opposing entity.

   (iv) Hearing.

      (A) The Board may decide to conduct a hearing upon request or on its own initiative.

      (B) The hearing date will be no earlier than 10 days after the petition is received, except:

         (1) for good cause shown; or

         (2) for petitions received less than 30 days before the election, in which case the hearing date will be no earlier than three days after the petition is received.

      (C) The respondent and each opposing candidate must notify the Board no less than one day in advance whether they will be represented at the hearing. Representation of a party at a hearing must be by a person with knowledge of the facts at issue.

      (D) At the hearing, testimony given may be under oath and no new documentary evidence will be considered unless good cause is shown for the party's failure to submit it with its petition or response.

   (v) Notice of determination. Following the review of disclosure statement filings; the petition and response, if any; and testimony and evidence presented at a hearing, if any, the Board will:

      (A) decide whether there is a sufficient basis for a determination; and

      (B) provide written notice to the petitioner and opposing entities, if any, of its determination.

   (vi) New petition for a preliminary public funds determination may be submitted based on new evidence. The Board's decision not to award public funds shall not be construed to preclude the subsequent submission of any petition based on new evidence for a determination respecting that candidate.

   (vii) Request for reconsideration. The petitioner or an opposing party may request reconsideration of a preliminary public funds determination.

      (A) A request for reconsideration must be made in writing no later than 10 days after the determination, and must include:

         (1) an affidavit of the party affirming that neither fundraising nor spending on behalf of the respondent that has taken place after the close of the most recent reporting period is sufficient to permit the Board to make a determination; and

         (2) an undertaking by the respondent to notify the Board immediately in writing if and when either fundraising or spending on behalf of the respondent becomes sufficient to permit the Board to make a determination pursuant to subdivision (a).

      (B) The Board shall consider the evidence, may conduct a hearing, and shall notify the petitioner of its determination.

      (C) The Board may consider a respondent's failure to respond to the petition, or the failure of the party requesting reconsideration to be represented at a hearing on the petition, to be a sufficient basis for denying a request for reconsideration. The Board shall notify the respondent, all opposing candidates, and the petitioner whether it will reconsider the determination pursuant to subdivision (a) or decision not to make such a determination, as the case may be.

      (D) The Board will respond within five business days of the filing of such petition.

   (viii) Appeal. A party may bring a special proceeding as set forth in Article 78 of the Civil Practice Law and Rules within four months of the Board's final determination denying the petition for reconsideration.

   (ii) Unless specifically notified to the contrary by the Board, the opportunity to submit information and documentation in response to the notice shall be the only such opportunity, and any information and documentation that is not timely received by the Board shall be disregarded. Under extraordinary circumstances, the Board may, at its sole discretion, choose to accept information or documentation not timely received.

(c) Final Board determination. Based on the evidence, the Board will make a final Board determination as to the party's violations or infractions, penalties, and public funds repayment obligation, and shall provide the party with a written copy of its determination. Such determination shall notify the party that it may be appealed within four months as set forth in Article 78 of the Civil Practice Law and Rules.

(d) Payment. If the Board has determined that the party must pay penalties or repay public funds, the party must make payment by the deadline set forth in the final Board determination.

Title 52: Campaign Finance Board*
--------------------------------------------------



*§ 9-01 [Repayment.]* ::


Candidates must promptly repay public funds upon a determination made by the Board that a repayment is required. Candidates returning public funds must make a check payable to the "New York City Election Campaign Finance Fund." Candidates may not reclaim public funds they have returned. Public funds must be repaid to the Board separately from, and in addition to, any penalties owed by the candidate.








*§ 9-02 Reasons for Repayment.* ::


The Board shall determine whether a candidate or such candidate's principal committee is required to repay public funds previously received as follows:

(a) Overpayment of public funds. Pursuant to § 3-710(2)(a) of the Code, the candidate's principal committee is required to pay to the Board an amount equivalent to the amount of public funds received in excess of the amount which the candidate is eligible to receive.

(b) Qualified expenditure deficit. Pursuant to § 3-710(2)(b) of the Code, the candidate's principal committee is required to pay to the Board an amount equivalent to the amount of public funds paid to the candidate that were not spent on qualified expenditures.

   (i) Determination of personal liability. A candidate may be personally liable for paying to the Board the amount of public funds not spent on qualified expenditures, or a portion of that amount. In considering whether and to what extent a participating candidate shall be personally liable for repayment of public funds, the Board shall act in accordance with the following:

      (A) where credible documentation supporting each qualified expenditure exists but is incomplete, the Board shall not impose such liability for such expenditure;

      (B) where there is an absence of credible documentation for each qualified expenditure, the Board may impose such liability upon a showing that such absence of credible documentation for such expenditure arose from a lack of adequate controls including, but not limited to, trained staff, internal procedures for following Board guidelines and internal procedures for employing standard financial controls.

(c) Final bank balance. Pursuant to § 3-710(2)(c) of the Code, the candidate and the principal committee are required to pay to the Board an amount equivalent to the campaign funds remaining in such candidate's principal committee account. The candidate must promptly pay to the Board such remaining funds; provided, however, that all remaining funds for a candidate shall be immediately due and payable to the Board upon a determination by the Board that the candidate has delayed the post-election audit process. The candidate must promptly pay to the Board any additional remaining campaign funds based upon a determination made by the Board at a subsequent date. The amount of remaining campaign funds shall be presumed to be equal to the candidate's authorized committee bank account balance on January 11 in the year following the election, or for special elections, on the last day of the reporting period for the final disclosure statement the candidate is required to file with the Board for such election, less any permissible documented post-election expenditures pursuant to paragraph (i) of this subdivision. The Board may also consider information revealed in the course of an audit or investigation in making a remaining funds determination, including, but not limited to, the fact that campaign expenditures were made in violation of law, that expenditures were made for any purpose other than the furtherance of the candidate's nomination or election, or that the candidate has not maintained or provided requested documentation. If a candidate repays to the Fund all funds remaining in such candidate's authorized committee bank account on or before December 31 in the year of the election, or, for special elections, on or before the last day of the month following the month in which the election took place, such candidate shall be presumed not to owe additional remaining funds, provided that any contributions received and expenditures made after such funds are repaid must be raised and spent in compliance with the Act and these rules.

   (i) Before repaying campaign funds remaining in the committee bank account, a candidate may make post-election expenditures only for routine activities involving nominal cost associated with winding up a campaign and responding to the post-election audit. Such expenditures may include: payment of utility bills and rent; reasonable staff salaries and consultancy fees for responding to a post-election audit; reasonable staff salaries and legal fees incurred prior to the date of the issuance of the candidate's final audit report and associated with defending against a claim that public funds must be repaid; a post-election event for staff, volunteers, or supporters held within 30 days of the election; reasonable moving expenses related to closing the campaign office; a holiday card mailing to contributors, campaign volunteers, and staff; thank you notes to contributors, campaign volunteers, and staff; payment of taxes and other reasonable expenses for compliance with applicable tax laws; and interest expense. Routine post-election expenditures that may be paid for with remaining campaign funds do not include such items as post-election mailings other than as specifically provided for in this paragraph; making contributions; or making bonus payments or gifts to staff or volunteers. Campaign funds remaining in the committee account may not be used for transition and inauguration activities.

   (ii) Notwithstanding the restriction on the use of receipts provided in subdivision (c)(i), a candidate who has outstanding liabilities from the election, including a candidate who owes public funds or penalties to the Board, may make post-election expenditures for the purpose of raising funds to repay such debt, provided, however, that such expenditures and any contributions received shall be included in the calculation of the candidate's remaining funds, unless such expenditures and contributions are incurred or received after the date of the issuance of the candidate's final audit report.

   (iii) Notwithstanding the prohibition on post-election bonus payments provided in subdivision (c)(i), a bonus payment to an employee may be considered a permissible pre-election expenditure, even if paid after the election, provided that:

      (A) the bonus is paid pursuant to a contract executed before the services that serve as the basis for the bonus are performed;

      (B) such contract states in detail the amount of the bonus and the criteria that must be satisfied in order for the bonus to be paid;

      (C) such criteria are quantifiable, merit-based, and related to services provided prior to the election;

      (D) the bonus is not conditioned, either in existence or amount, on the result of the election, the amount of funds remaining in the committee account, or whether the candidate received public funds; and

      (E) the bonus does not constitute more than 10% of the total amount paid to the employee.

(d) Repayment is largest amount. Where more than one grounds for repayment exists as provided in subdivisions (a), (b), and (c) of this section, the amount to be paid to the Board shall be the largest of the amounts.

(e) Breach of certification. A candidate found to have breached such candidate's certification pursuant to 52 RCNY § 3-01(e) may be deemed ineligible to receive public funds and may be required to return all public funds previously received.

(f) Ballot disqualification. Pursuant to § 3-709(7) of the Code, a candidate who has been finally disqualified or whose designating or nominating petitions have been finally declared invalid by the Board of Elections or a court of competent jurisdiction, may not thereafter spend public funds for any purpose other than the payment of previous liabilities incurred in qualified campaign expenditures. All public funds in excess of such liabilities previously incurred shall be promptly repaid to the Board; the amount to be repaid shall be determined in accordance with § 3-710(2)(b) of the Code and subdivision (b) of this section. A repayment made pursuant to § 3-709(7) shall not preclude a determination that an additional repayment is required pursuant to that or any other provision of the Act.

(g) Ballot fraud. Pursuant to § 3-710(3) of the Code, a candidate who has been disqualified by a court of competent jurisdiction on the grounds that such candidate committed fraudulent acts in order to obtain a place on the ballot, if such decision is not reversed, must pay to the Board an amount equal to the total public funds paid to the candidate. Repayments pursuant to this subdivision must be made promptly upon the court's determination of disqualification.

(h) Other reasons for repayment. The Board may require a candidate to repay public funds because:

   (i) the candidate failed to maintain copies of checks or contribution cards that document matchable contributions;

   (ii) the public funds paid were based on contributions that were returned or contribution checks that have not been paid;

   (iii) the candidate has failed to demonstrate eligibility for the public funds paid or compliance with Program requirements; or

   (iv) a determination pursuant to §§ 3-705(6) or (7) of the Code is reversed following reconsideration pursuant to 52 RCNY § 7-10(b)(vii).

Title 52: Campaign Finance Board*
--------------------------------------------------



*§ 15-01 Special Requirements and Procedures.* ::


If a special election to fill a vacancy is declared, the Board, after considering the date of the election and any other relevant factors, may provide for special requirements and procedures for candidates, including:

(a) a standard by which contributions, loans, and expenditures are presumed to be accepted or made for the special election, notwithstanding 52 RCNY §§ 5-10(a), 5-09(h), and 6-01(h)(i); and

(b) such other requirements and procedures as the Board may deem necessary to implement the provisions of the Act in the special election fully and effectively.








*§ 15-02 Filing Requirements.* ::


(a) Certification. Candidates who wish to participate in the Program for a special election must file a Certification with the Board specifically for such election. The Certification must be filed on or before the 14th day after the proclamation of such election and may not be rescinded.

(b) Filer Registration. Candidates who do not wish to participate in the Program are not required to file a Certification, but must file a Filer Registration specifically for the special election with the Board.

(c) Candidates raising funds for other elections within the same election cycle. Candidates who have already been raising funds for other elections occurring after the special election, but within the same election cycle, may use their existing committees and bank accounts in the special election, provided that they amend their registration with the Board of Elections to reflect the change in election, and further provided that once such committee and account have been used for the special election, they must not be used for any future election, including any other elections during the same election cycle.

(d) Disclosure statements.

   (i) Post-election financial activity. Financial activity that occurred after a candidate's most recent election prior to a special election will be considered to be for such special election.

   (ii) First disclosure statement. The first disclosure statement for a special election is due 32 days before the election unless otherwise provided by New York State Election Law. As provided pursuant to New York State Election Law, if the first disclosure statement for a special election is otherwise due within a period of five days of a required semi-annual disclosure statement, the candidate may file a single combined statement on the date on which the latter of the two separate statements is required to be filed.

      (A) The reporting period for the first disclosure statement shall conclude on the 36th day before the election, unless otherwise provided pursuant to New York State Election Law. If a candidate is already registered for a future election and an intervening special election is called, the candidate is required to re-register with the Board for the special election and re-submit all of the candidate's financial activity with such candidate's first special election disclosure statement.

      (B) Submissions required by paragraph (ii) above shall cover the reporting periods of the missing disclosure.

   (iii) Semi-annual disclosure statements.

      (A) Semi-annual disclosure statements are due on January 15 and July 15 in each year of the election cycle and on January 15 in the year after the election.

      (B) Notwithstanding subparagraph (A) above:

         (1) for candidates in a special election who proceed to raise or spend funds for the following primary or general election, the 27 day post-election disclosure statement described in paragraph (iv) shall be the last statement required for the special election; provided, however, that if there is a runoff special election, the semi-annual disclosure statement described in paragraph (iv) shall be the last disclosure statement required for all candidates in the special election who continue to raise or spend funds for the following primary or general election, regardless of whether they were candidates in the runoff special election; and

         (2) for candidates in a special election who do not proceed to raise or spend funds for the following primary or general election, the first semi-annual disclosure statement due following the date of the special election shall be the last statement required for the special election; provided, however, that if the first semi-annual disclosure statement following the date of the special election is due less than 30 days after the deadline for filing the 27 day post-election disclosure statement, the second semi-annual disclosure statement after the date of the special election shall be the last statement required for the special election.

   (iv) Daily disclosures during the two weeks preceding the election. If a candidate, during the 14 days preceding an election, accepts aggregate contributions and/or loans from a single source in excess of $1,000 or makes aggregate expenditures to a single vendor in excess of $20,000, the candidate must report, in a disclosure to the Board, all contributions and loans accepted from such source or expenditures made to such vendor during that 14-day period. The first such disclosure must be received by the Board within 24 hours after the contribution or loan that causes the total to exceed $1,000 is accepted or the expenditure that causes the total to exceed $20,000 is made. Each subsequent disclosure must be received by the Board within 24 hours after any additional contribution or loan is accepted or expenditure is made. Information reported in these disclosures must also be included in the candidate's next post-election disclosure statement.

   (v) Post-runoff special election disclosure statements. For runoff special election candidates, post-election disclosure statements must be filed 27 days after the special election and on the first January 15 or July 15 following the election. Candidates in the special election must file both post-runoff special election disclosure statements, regardless of whether they were on the ballot for the runoff special election.

   (vi) Disclosure statement amendments. The Board shall not make payments based on disclosure statement amendments filed after the final disclosure statement; provided, however, that the Board may make payments based upon such amendments solely if they are made in response to invalid matching claims reports to which the Board has requested a response after the final disclosure statement.

   (vii) Bank statements. Each disclosure statement submitted by the candidate must include a copy of the most recent bank statements for the candidate's special election account.

   (viii) Special election due dates for compliance with § 12-110 of the Code. If the deadline for filing financial disclosure reports with the conflicts of interest board pursuant to § 12-110(b)(2) of the Code is before the due date for the first disclosure statement required to be filed with the Board pursuant to 52 RCNY § 15-02(d)(ii), the candidate's compliance with the requirements in § 12-110 of the Code shall be considered timely demonstrated to the Board if the Board receives confirmation of the candidate's compliance on or prior to the disclosure statement due date. If the deadline for filing financial disclosure reports with the conflicts of interest board pursuant to § 12-110(b)(2) of the Code is on or after the due date for the first disclosure statement required to be filed with the Board pursuant to 52 RCNY § 15-02(d)(ii), the candidate's compliance with the requirements in § 12-110 of the Code shall be considered timely demonstrated to the Board if the Board receives confirmation of the candidate's compliance no later than one business day after the last day for filing disclosure reports with the conflicts of interest board.
