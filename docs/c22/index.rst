You may attend religious services with general population inmates unless you are found to pose a threat to the safety and security of the institution, including if the Department finds it likely that you will disrupt the service. Upon incarceration, you will be given more information about your religious rights in jail in accordance with New York City Board of Correction standards (§ 1-08).

(d) Telephone calls. The Department may limit your telephone calls if they constitute a threat to institutional safety or security, if you abuse the telephone regulations or in accordance with a court order. Upon incarceration, you will be given more information about your rights to telephone calls. If you are affected by a determination made pursuant to this subdivision, you may appeal such determination to the New York City Board of Correction by providing written notice. Written notice must also be provided to the Department of Correction and the Facility. You may also submit any additional relevant materials for the Board's consideration. The Board will issue a written response upon the appeal within five (5) business days after receiving the appeal.

      (i) You are notified of the hearing and refuse to appear; or

      (ii) You appear and are extremely disruptive, causing a situation, which is unduly hazardous to institutional safety, and necessitating your removal from the hearing room thus constituting a constructive refusal to appear.

      (i) To personally appear.

      (ii) To make statements.
