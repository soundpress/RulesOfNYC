Applications must be submitted in writing either by mail or by completing the online form on the Department's website and will be considered in the order in which they are received as shown by the postmark date and time or by the timestamp, respectively.

(c) Upon application, the Commissioner may deny a permit if:

   (1) the location sought is not suitable because of landscaping, planting, or other environmental conditions reasonably likely to be harmed by the proposed event;

   (2) the location sought is not suitable because it is a specialized area including, but not limited to, a zoo, swimming pool, or skating rink, or because the proposed event is of such nature or duration that it cannot reasonably be accommodated in that location;

   (3) the date and time requested have previously been allotted by permit;

(g) Permittees must have the permit in their possession at the time and site of the event, as well as any other permits for the event required by the Department or any other governmental agency.

(h) After notice and opportunity to be heard, the Commissioner may alter or add terms and conditions to a permit, or revoke a permit, based upon the criteria set forth in subdivision (c) of this section.

(i) If the Commissioner revokes a permit prior to the date of the event, the permittee may appeal the revocation, subject to the time limitations set forth in subdivision (e) of this section.

(j) Permittees must confine their activities to the locations and times specified on their permit. The Commissioner may establish specific guidelines for certain designated parks or park locations.

(k) During the course of an event, the Commissioner may suspend a permit where exigent circumstances exist in the vicinity of the location for which such permit has been issued.

(l) The granting of a permit does not give the permittee the right to sell or offer for sale any articles, tickets, or refreshments within or adjacent to any park area. To do this requires a separate Temporary Use Authorization issued by the Department.

(m) Permits are not transferable.

(n) If a permittee intends to drive vehicles (e.g., buses, cars, trucks, and vans) into a park for deliveries to an event site or for any other legitimate purpose, the permittee must obtain a separate written permit for each such vehicle, specifying the date, time, route, and parking privilege.

(o) Permit applications must indicate whether electrical energy is required for the event. Permittees shall be responsible for the procurement of and payment for any electrical energy used during the event.

(q) Permittees shall be held liable for any and all damages or injuries to persons or property that may occur or be caused by the use of the permit. By accepting a permit, permittees agree to indemnify and hold harmless the City and the Department from any and all claims whatsoever that may result from such use.

(r) Should there be any injuries, accidents, or other health incidents at an event, permittee must notify the Department immediately by calling the Department's hotline, 1-800-201-PARK.

There shall be a rebuttable presumption that any person or organization whose name, telephone number or other identifying information appears on any advertisement and who has been informed of the Department's intent to deny an application for such permit or of the Department's issuance of another permit for that time and location has violated this subdivision by either (1) illegally advertising an event, or (2) directing, suffering, or permitting a servant, agent, employee or other individual under such person's or organization's control to engage in such activity; provided, however, that such rebuttable presumption shall not apply with respect to criminal prosecutions brought pursuant to this subdivision (s).

(t) The following conditions apply to applications for permits for special events and demonstrations on the Great Lawn:

   (1) In any calendar year there will be a maximum of seven permits granted for large events on the Great Lawn. For purposes of this subdivision, a large event is a special event or demonstration with anticipated attendance between 5,000 and 60,000 attendees, which requires the use of the ballfields on the Great Lawn, and for events with anticipated attendance of over 50,000, the use of the Turtle Pond lawn area and/or the small lawn panels on both the east and west sides of the ballfields on the Great Lawn. The number of attendees will be limited as follows: (i) no more than 50,000 attendees on the ballfields of the Great Lawn; (ii) no more than 5,000 attendees on the Turtle Pond lawn area; and (iii) no more than 5,000 attendees combined on the small lawn panels to the east and west of the ballfields on the Great Lawn.

   (2) Small events on the Great Lawn are not subject to the limitation contained in paragraph (1) of this subsection. For purposes of this subdivision, a small event is a special event or demonstration with anticipated attendance of less than 5,000 participants, which does not require the use of any of the Great Lawn ballfields during the hours that the Department permits the ballfields for athletic uses, and does not displace any athletic use on the Great Law. Small events are subject to paragraphs (5), (6), (7), and (8) of this subsection and permits for special events or demonstrations will not be granted for any ballfields when the ballfields are otherwise closed to all uses.

   (3) Attendance at large events may not exceed 60,000 persons.

   (4) Large events may take place only during the months of June and July, and during the period from the third week of August through the first day of October. A maximum of two events may take place during each of the following time periods: the month of June, the month of July, and the period from the third week of August through the second week of September. A maximum of one large-scale event may be held during the period between September 15th and October 1st.

   (5) Events on the Great Lawn are subject to cancellation by the Commissioner due to inclement weather and/or soil and turf conditions. Factors the Commissioner will take into consideration in determining whether to cancel an event shall include: (i) the possibility of lightning or other extreme weather condition; (ii) rainfall (including forecasted, current, or cumulative rainfall); (iii) soil saturation levels or other risks to turf health; and (iv) any other field conditions that might lead to significant damage to the Great Lawn or the surrounding landscapes.

   (6) The load-in plan for all events must be approved by the Commissioner in order to assure that (A) the flow of persons through park landscapes on appropriately designated paths for that purpose shall be orderly; and (B) the attendees will not damage adjacent landscapes. In addition, in the case of larger events, the load-in plan must be approved by the Commissioner to assure that maximum number of persons attending does not exceed 60,000 and is in compliance with area restrictions set forth in the last sentence of subdivision t (1) above. In approving an applicant's load-in plan, the Commissioner shall take into consideration any evidence that the applicant has a proven track record of successfully executed event productions and audience management.

   (7) An applicant seeking to hold a large or small event shall post a bond in an amount sufficient to pay for any anticipated damage to the Great Lawn in connection with the scheduled event and made payable to the Department. The amount of the bond will be determined by the Commissioner based upon the following factors: (A) the length of the event; (B) the time of year of the event; (C) the nature of the event, including but not limited to, the type of equipment that will need to be brought onto the Great Lawn, the location of such equipment, and the use of any vehicles on the Great Lawn; (D) the number of people attending the event; (E) experience regarding any prior events of the same or a similar nature; and (F) whether the event or any activities associated with the event present a high risk of property damage. However, the Commissioner shall have the authority to waive the bond required by this subdivision where the applicant is able to demonstrate that such bond cannot be obtained without imposing an unreasonable hardship on the applicant. Any request for a waiver of the bond required by this subdivision shall be included by the applicant in their application submitted under this section. The burden of demonstrating unreasonable hardship shall be on the applicant and may be demonstrated by a showing that the cost of obtaining the bond for the event exceeds twenty-five percent (25%) of the applicant's budget for the event. The budget for the event must include not only cash, but also the actual value of any materials and services to be used by the applicant for the event.

   (8) A written acknowledgment by the applicant stating, where applicable, how the applicant will comply with the foregoing provisions must be fully executed no less than 10 days prior to the scheduled event's initial load in. However, for a special event application involving a demonstration that is made less than ten days before the proposed event, where exigent circumstances prevented timely application, the written acknowledgment must be executed as soon as practicable before the event's initial load-in.

(u) The East Meadow in Central Park and the paved areas south of the Bethesda Terrace, including the Literary Walk and the Bandshell areas, are available for large special events or demonstrations. The Department will allow up to two (2) events per month that occupy the East Meadow for twenty-four hours or more. The time that an event occupies the East Meadow starts at the occurrence of the initial load-in of equipment and any other materials for the event and concludes when the load-out of the event, including the removal from the park of all equipment and any other materials for the event, is completed.

(v) The Sheep Meadow is reserved solely for passive recreation and the North Meadow and the Heckscher Ballfields are reserved solely for athletic events with permits and passive recreation. The Department does not grant any permits for special events or demonstrations on the Sheep Meadow, the North Meadow or the Heckscher Ballfields in Central Park.

The Department may consider an out-of-season permit application for ballfields that are designed to host a variety of sports (e.g., baseball in the fall, soccer in the spring) provided there are not qualified applicants for the priority seasonal uses set forth above. Permit holders granted permits for out-of-season use will not be treated as a Returning Applicant should they apply the year following the issuance of an out-of-season permit. No grass ballfields will be available during the winter season.

   (6) Applications received (during the relevant application period) will be categorized by the following factors:

      (i) Youth or Adult Recreation

      (ii) Returning or New Applicants

      (iii) Short Term or Seasonal Applicants

   (7) For Applications received during the relevant application period, the Department will first consider Youth Recreation permit requests before any Adult Recreation permit requests.

The Department will also consider the following factors when allocating Youth Recreation permits:

      (i) whether the applicant is part of a Youth League.

      (ii) whether the Youth League is part of an official school league.

      (iii) whether the Short Term Permit Applicant(s) can be accommodated before allocating permits for Seasonal Applicants.

      (iv) whether the Department can accommodate newly established Youth Leagues in order to equitably allocate ballfield and court usage as between newly established and Returning Applicant Youth Leagues.

      (v) Due to space limitations, the Department may reject permit requests from applicants that seek the reservation of ballfields or courts for practice sessions. Permits issued for practice sessions will not be treated as part of a Returning Applicant's previous season's permits for purposes of determining whether an applicant is a New Applicant or a Returning Applicant.

   (8) For applications received during the relevant application period, after the Department has accommodated the Youth Recreation applications, the Department will process Adult Recreation permit requests. Adult Recreation applicants that are also Returning Applicants and have 1) fully complied with the terms and conditions of the previous season's permits and 2) all other Department rules and regulations, will be given preference to use to use the same dates and times allotted in the previous season. The Department will also consider the following factors:

      (i) whether the applicant is part of an Adult League.

      (ii) whether Short Term Permit Application(s) can be accommodated before allocating permits for Seasonal Applications.

      (iii) whether the Department can accommodate newly established Adult Leagues in order to equitably allocate ballfield usage as between newly established and Returning Applicant Adult Leagues.

      (iv) Due to space limitations, the Department may reject permit applications that seek the reservation of ballfields or courts for practice sessions. Permits issued for practice sessions will not be treated as part of a Returning Applicant's previous season's permits for purposes of determining whether an applicant is a New Applicant or a Returning Applicant.

   (9) Applications received after the relevant application period will be processed on a first come, first served basis, after all Applications received during the relevant application period are processed.

(c) Permit requirements and limitations.

   (1) The Department reserves the right to leave ballfield or court time unpermitted at various locations for other authorized uses, to accommodate Departmental use, for maintenance purposes, or to allow other unpermitted activity.

   (2) The Department reserves the right to move permit holders to another location if necessary as determined by the Department, or assign a permit applicant to a location other than the location(s) the applicant requested.

   (3) The Department reserves the right to cancel permitted ballfield or court activity due to inclement weather and/or conditions that can result in long-term damage to the ballfield or court.

   (4) This section does not apply to use of a ballfield or court that is subject to a license agreement to maintain and operate specified ballfields or courts during the times the licensee is authorized to use the ballfield or court.

   (5) The Department reserves the right to require a clean-up bond and/or liability insurance for the use of a ballfield or court, in which case the City shall be named as an additional insured. The factors considered by the Department to determine whether a bond or insurance are required for such event or game are: (i) estimated number of spectators expected to attend, (ii) involvement of vendors (where permitted by the Department), (iii) past history of the league or event, or (iv) such other factors as the Department may reasonably consider.

   (6) All permit holders must have their permit(s), and any other documents required by the Department or any other City agency, in their possession at the time and site of the proposed activity.

   (7) Any transfer of permit(s) requires the approval of the athletic permit coordinator of the borough in which the ballfields or courts are located. Once approved, the transfer must take place in the office of the Department staff responsible for issuing ballfield permits in the relevant borough with both transferor and transferee present. A permit may not be transferred in any other way.

   (8) All permits are revocable at any time and at the discretion of the Commissioner, or at the discretion of the Commissioner's designated representative. Reasons for revocation include, but are not limited to: (i) providing incorrect or false information on an application form, (ii) failure to adhere to Department rules or the conditions of the permit, and (iii) the use, by adults, of a permit issued for a Youth League. The permit holder has the right to appeal the revocation of a permit to the Department's General Counsel, within ten (10) days immediately following the mailing of notice of revocation by the Department. Said appeal must be in writing. The decision of the Department's General Counsel shall be final.

   (9) The maximum number of reserved hours that any person or entity (other than a Youth League) holding a permit may have is 32 per week, except in parks where there are more than ten (10) ballfields available for permitted use. If the Department determines that ballfields or courts are in high demand, the Department may approve a permit application in part and reject it in part, granting the permit holder some fraction of the requested ballfield or court time and/or granting permits for alternate locations.

   (10) The Department may inspect any ballfield or court to determine if the permit holder is utilizing all of its permitted time. In the event that the Department determines the permit holder is not using all of the permitted time, the Department may reduce the amount of permitted time.

   (11) If the use of ballfields or courts constitutes a special event as outlined in 56 RCNY § 2-08, a special event permit shall be required in addition to the relevant ballfield permits. If the use of ballfields or courts involves vending as outlined in 56 RCNY § 1-05(b), vending permits shall be required in addition to the relevant ballfield permits.

*§ 4-04 Permits.* ::


(a)  No person shall place a mooring or moor a vessel in a mooring field without a permit from the Department.

(b) A permit shall authorize the use of a mooring that meets the requirements of subdivision (a) of 56 RCNY § 4-07, the location of a mooring at a particular position in the mooring field, and the mooring of a particular vessel identified by size, type, registration number and mooring designation.

No vessel shall be moored at such moorings for the accommodation of guest vessels of such yacht clubs or marinas for more than 15 consecutive days. Any such person, yacht club, marina, or other government entity that is issued a permit pursuant to this subdivision shall be subject to the provisions of this chapter to the same extent and in the same manner as the owner or lessee of a vessel who is issued a permit pursuant to this chapter.

(i) The term of a permit issued for the Sheepshead Bay or Great Kills Harbor mooring fields is for one year commencing May 1.

The Department shall send by certified mail notice of the intention to revoke, terminate, or refuse to renew a permit and the reasons therefor. In the event that a mailing address is unknown or mail is returned undelivered, such notice may, in lieu of mailing, be posted in a conspicuous place on the vessel. A permittee or applicant for renewal may file written objections with the Commissioner within 15 days from the date of such mailing or posting, whichever is later. After considering any objections raised by the applicant or permittee, the Commissioner shall make a final determination whether to affirm or reverse the chief dockmaster's determination to revoke, terminate or refuse to renew the permit and shall provide notice of such determination to the permittee or applicant in the manner provided herein.

(l) Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to create a property right in any permit. All permits issued by the Department are by their nature terminable at will by the Commissioner in accordance with the needs or requirements of the Department or in the interests of the City as determined by the Commissioner.

(m) The Department may impose reasonable conditions on the issuance of a permit to protect public safety and to safeguard the interests of the City, including but not limited to a requirement that the permittee or applicant have his or her mooring inspected or obtain appropriate insurance and submit satisfactory evidence of having complied with such conditions.

(n) Where a permit is revoked, terminated or not renewed, the vessel and all parts of the mooring, including anchors, chains and buoys, must be removed from the mooring field within 30 days after notice by the Department to remove the same is sent by certified mail to the applicant or permittee. In the event that a mailing address is unknown or mail is returned undelivered, such notice may, in lieu of such mailing or hand delivery, be posted in a conspicuous place on the vessel. Where the vessel and mooring are not removed within 30 days after the mailing or posting of such notice, whichever is later, the Department may remove the vessel and mooring or cause the same to be removed from the mooring field. The permittee or owner shall be liable for the costs of removal and storage of the vessel and mooring, payable prior to release of the same. Any vessel or mooring removed from the mooring field that is not claimed within 30 days may be deemed to be abandoned and shall be treated in accordance with applicable law.

(o) Every applicant and permittee must provide the Department with a day and evening telephone number as well as an e-mail and/or mailing address in writing at which he or she may receive notice required by these rules or other applicable law. Any changes in telephone number, e-mail, or mailing address must be reported in writing to the Department within 10 days.

*§ 4-07 Mooring of Vessels.* ::


(a)  All vessels moored at the boat basin shall be secured to the mooring provided by not less than two mooring bridles. The boat basin provides mooring lines at the beginning of the summer season. The permittee is expected to maintain or replace lines as needed throughout the season. All vessels at the Sheepshead Bay or Great Kills Harbor mooring fields shall be secured by moorings meeting the following requirements:

   (1) The anchor, chain and pendant of all moorings shall meet the following requirements:

      (A) the anchor scope shall be at least three times the distance from the land under the water of the harbor to mean high water;

      (B) the pendant safe working load shall be at least four times the anchor weight;

      (C) the anchor type shall be either mushroom or navy;

      (D) (i)  if the vessel length is 15 feet or less, each anchor shall weigh at least 100 pounds and be connected to a buoy by a metal chain no less than 5/16 inches in diameter, and the pendant shall be at least 4 feet in length; (ii) the vessel length is greater than 15 feet but not greater than 21 feet, each anchor shall weigh at least 150 pounds and be connected to a buoy by a metal chain no less than 3/8 inches in diameter, and the pendant shall be at least 8 feet in length; (iii) if the vessel length is greater than 21 feet but not greater than 26 feet, each anchor shall weigh at least 200 pounds and be connected to a buoy by a metal chain no less than 3/8 inches in diameter, and the pendant shall be at least 10 feet in length; (iv) if the vessel length is greater than 26 feet but less than or equal to 65 feet, each anchor shall weigh no less than 10 pounds per foot of vessel length and be connected to a buoy by a metal chain no less than 1/2 inch in diameter for each anchor weighing no more than 400 pounds, or not less than 5/8 inches in diameter for each anchor weighing more than 400 pounds, and the pendant shall be at least 10 feet in length.

   (2) Moorings in the special anchorage area in Sheepshead Bay shall be secured by two anchors. Moorings in all other mooring fields shall be secured by one anchor, provided, however, that the Department may require the use of two anchors in any mooring field in order to provide additional positions at which moorings may be located or to enhance the safety of existing mooring locations.

   (3) Mooring buoys shall be spherical, made of a hard plastic outer shell and filled with foam. Mooring buoys shall be capable of transmitting the strain exerted on the road through its center. The buoys shall be of a size that, given the weight of chain to be suspended and the strain expected to be exerted on the rode, there shall be at least 12 inches of the buoy exposed above the surface of the water.

   (4) Buoys shall be painted with the permit number and the mooring location in black block letters no less than three inches high.

   (5) Fixed mooring piles or stakes are not permitted.

(b) Vessels must be moored at locations designated by the Department. The location assigned to the permittee shall be determined by the Department based on vessel size, type, water depth and safety considerations. No vessel shall be moored in such a manner as to interfere with the use of a duly authorized mooring location or regular traffic channel. Mooring locations may not be changed or exchanged without the prior written approval of the Department.

(c) All vessels shall be adequately tied to their moorings and shall have sufficient lines to secure the vessel in all wind and weather conditions. The Department may affix additional lines as necessary to ensure the safety of people or property.

(d) All parts of the mooring, including the buoys, anchors and chains, shall be supplied and installed by the permittee and shall remain the property of the permittee at the mooring fields at Sheepshead Bay and Great Kills Harbor.

A sunken vessel or dinghy shall be removed from the mooring fields within 48 hours after oral or written notice by the Department to remove the vessel or dinghy. Upon request of the permittee or the owner of the vessel or dinghy, the Department may, in writing, extend the time for removal of the vessel or dinghy. If the vessel or dinghy is not removed within the allowed time, the Department may remove the vessel or dinghy or cause it to be removed and may recover the cost associated with removal and of storage or disposal of the vessel or dinghy from the permittee or owner of the vessel or dinghy. If the Department determines that a sunken vessel or dinghy is discharging pollutants into the water or causing any other kind of an emergency, the Department may take action to stop the cause of pollution and may remove or cause the vessel or dinghy to be removed, without prior notice to the permittee or owner of the vessel or dinghy, and recover all costs associated with removal and storage or disposal of the vessel or dinghy from the permittee or owner of the vessel or dinghy.

(b) In the event that the permittee or vessel owner fails to pay for a permit or the repair and service of such vessel and equipment, the Department may detain the vessel until such sum is paid. In the event that such outstanding sum is not paid in full within 90 days, the Department may secure such vessel with chains and/or locks, or cause such vessel and equipment to be moved to a non-active slip or pier, be disposed of as abandoned property, or be sold at auction.

Chapter 5: Rules Governing Tree Replacement
--------------------------------------------------



*§ 5-01 Removal of Trees.* ::


(a) Any person who intends to remove any tree under the jurisdiction of the Department shall apply for and obtain a permit under this chapter prior to such removal.

(b) If the Department approves a removal request for a tree, issuance of a permit under this chapter shall require the applicant to pay a fee to the Department sufficient to cover the cost of replacing any tree proposed to be removed as set forth in this chapter, unless otherwise permitted by law. The applicant shall indicate in writing whether they intend to plant the required number of replacement trees, as directed by the Department, or requests that the Department plant such replacement trees at applicant's cost.

(c) In addition to all other legal remedies, the Department shall seek damages, as applicable, as determined under 56 RCNY § 5-02(d)-(f), from any person who violates 56 RCNY § 1-04(b)(1)(i).






*§ 5-02 Determination of Replacement Trees.* ::


(a) Determination of replacement trees. The number of trees needed to replace each tree approved for removal shall be determined by calculating the size, condition, species and location rating of the tree proposed for removal. If a removal permit is approved by the Commissioner, the Department, no later than ninety (90) days following the filing of a completed application for a permit, shall inform the applicant, based on the factors herein, the number and size of replacement trees to be planted and the period of time during which the replacement trees shall be planted and the fee for such replacements. In order to determine the applicable rating for any tree approved for removal the Department horticultural officer shall take into consideration the following:

   (1) Size. The size rating of a tree shall be determined by measuring the diameter of the tree at breast height (four and one half (4 1/2) feet above the ground) and then calculating the cross sectional area of the trunk in square inches.

   (2) Condition. The condition rating of a tree shall be based on the following factors:

      a. The structure and health of its roots;

      b. The structure and health of its trunk;

      c. The structure and health of its branches;

      d. The health of its small branches and twigs; and

      e. The health of its foliage and/or buds. However, if the Department determines, after consulting with the applicant, that a tree requested for removal is dead or seriously diseased, or otherwise represents a hazard to public safety, such tree will not result in any required replacement trees unless the hazard was caused by actions of the applicant.

   (3) Species. The species rating of a tree shall be based on the magnitude and longevity of the services and benefits the species provides in the City. Magnitude and longevity are established by tree stature at maturity (i.e., mature height), and expected tree lifespan.

   (4) Location. The location factor of a tree shall be determined by considering how well the site supports the tree's biological, physical and chemical needs; and a tree's placement in the landscape with respect to both the tree's positioning within and its relationship to its surroundings.

      a. The rating of the site where a tree is growing is established by considering the following:

         i. whether the site is in a park or landscaped area with ample belowground and overhead growing space;

         ii. whether the site is in the street but there is enough above and below ground space to support the tree;

         iii. whether the species of tree is tolerant of the site's difficult growing conditions, if any;

         iv. whether the site is physically limiting to the tree, but the tree's stature and root system are appropriate for current adjacent infrastructure (e.g., small stature under utility wires or next to a building or retaining wall);

         v. whether the tree is negatively impacted by existing site infrastructure;

         vi. whether the site contains objects, such as houses, power lines, or playgrounds, in the path of tree should it fall and the tree is of a structurally sound species;

         vii. whether physical space limitations at the site will challenge the success of the tree over time;

         viii. whether the species of tree is only moderately tolerant of the site's difficult growing conditions, if any;

         ix. whether the tree's stature or root system is inappropriate for adjacent current site infrastructure (e.g., large tree under utility wires or too close to a building foundation or bridge parapet); and

         x. whether the site contains objects, such as houses, power lines, or playgrounds, in the path of tree should it fall and the tree is of a structurally weak species.

      b. The rating for a tree's placement in its surrounding landscape is determined by considering the following:

         i. whether the tree is a native species in or adjacent to a natural area or large park;

         ii. whether the tree is a historic specimen or part of a grove, or is an original planting in a historic landscape;

         iii. whether the tree is the only, or one of a few, in the area;

         iv. whether the tree is extremely complimentary to or prominent within an adjacent view, land use, structure or natural landscape element;

         v. whether the tree is one of a group of plantings and its individual loss would have minimal visual or environmental impact on the entire group of plantings;

         vi. whether the tree is very important within a group of other plantings, such as an allée or along an even-aged block, and its loss would be of high impact to that planting group; and

         vii. whether the tree provides exceptional services based on its location (e.g., shade in a playground or sitting area, property value in front of a building, stormwater absorption in or near a wetland).

   (5) a. Number of Replacement Trees. Based on the factors established in 56 RCNY § 5-02(a)(1) - (4), the Department will determine the required number of replacement trees.

      b. In no case shall the number of replacement trees equal less than one caliper inch of replacement tree for each caliper inch of tree removed.

   (6) Calculation of Fee for a Tree Removal Permit. The Department will determine the total fee for a tree removal permit pursuant to 56 RCNY § 5-01(a) by multiplying the number of required replacement trees by the cost per tree, which is determined by calculating the average planting price for a three (3) inch caliper street tree as derived from all Department planting contracts for the City fiscal year preceding the date of the permit application.

   (7) The timing for planting replacement trees shall be determined by the Department's horticultural officer and stated within the permit unless otherwise permitted by law. However, each replacement tree under such a permit shall be planted no later than sixty (60) days after the project for which the tree removal was requested has been completed, or in the next ensuing spring or fall season after such project is completed or earlier as agreed by the applicant and the Department.

   (8) Size of Replacement Trees. All replacement trees will be three (3) inch caliper, unless otherwise authorized by the Department.

(b) Payment to the Department.

   (1) If a person granted a permit pursuant to 56 RCNY § 5-01(a) requests that the Department plant any required replacement trees, such person shall pay the required fee to the Department prior to the issuance of any such permit unless otherwise permitted by law.

   (2) If a person granted a permit pursuant to 56 RCNY § 5-01(a) and subject to paragraph one of this subdivision intends to plant any required replacement trees, such person shall notify the Department in advance and pay the required fee to the Department prior to the issuance of any such permit. If the required replacement tree(s) are planted by the permittee as directed by the Department, the Department shall return any such fee within sixty (60) days of confirmation by the Department that such trees were properly planted by permittee. If any such tree(s) is not replanted as directed by the Department by the time specified within the permit, the Department shall retain such fee for the purpose of planting said replacement trees.

(c) Irreparable Tree Damage. If a tree is damaged beyond recovery or if it is damaged so that it poses a safety risk, as determined by the Department, it shall be removed, including its stump, at the permittee's expense if a permit is in effect pursuant to 56 RCNY § 5-01(a), or at the expense of the person responsible for such damage if no permit is in effect. In such instances, the tree shall be evaluated for replacement purposes pursuant to 56 RCNY § 5-02(a) based on its condition prior to suffering irreparable damage.

(d) Destruction and Tree Removal. If a tree is destroyed and removed without a permit pursuant to 56 RCNY § 5-01(a), there shall be a rebuttable presumption that such tree was in perfect condition prior to such removal. In this instance the tree shall be evaluated pursuant to 56 RCNY § 5-02(a) for all other factors. However, the size of the removed tree shall be determined either by the diameter of the remaining stump or from existing Department records. The cost of the total number of replacement trees to be planted shall equal the appraised value of the destroyed or removed tree.

(e) Injured Trees. If a tree is damaged or injured, but not destroyed or removed, a Department horticultural officer will make the following two (2) appraisals using the method established in 56 RCNY § 5-02(a) in order to determine the value of the damaged or injured tree. The first appraisal shall account for the tree's condition prior to damage or injury. The second appraisal shall account for the tree's condition after damage or injury, with all other factors being equal. The difference between the two appraisals shall equal the replacement value caused by the injury and the sum for which the permit holder or person responsible for the injury is responsible.

(f) The location of replacement trees shall be determined by the Department's horticultural officer unless otherwise permitted by law. To the extent practicable, replacement trees shall be planted within the same community district from which the tree(s) that were the subject of the permit were removed. Where the horticultural officer determines that it is not feasible to plant the total number of replacement trees at the subject location, the person granted the permit under 56 RCNY § 5-01(a) shall be required to plant the remaining replacement trees at locations capable of accommodating such planting, either as close as possible to the property from which the original trees were removed, destroyed or severely damaged, or as the horticultural officer deems feasible. The person granted the permit under 56 RCNY § 5-01(a) may propose in writing to the horticultural officer alternate locations, so that provision may be made for the planting of all required replacement trees. Where the horticultural officer determines that a proposed alternate location or the number of replacement trees proposed to be planted at an alternate location is not feasible, the horticultural officer may select other locations to accommodate the planting of all required replacement trees.






*§ 5-03 Tree Planting in Lieu of Obligations under the Zoning Requirements.* ::


If a person or entity is required under Zoning Resolution Article 2, Chapter 6, Section 41 to plant street trees, but pursuant to the Zoning Resolution such person or entity is required or opts to have the Department plant such trees on such person or entity's behalf, then the person or entity must deposit the cost per tree, which is determined by calculating the average planting price for a three (3) inch caliper street tree based on Department planting contracts for the preceding City fiscal year, in an account of the City as directed by the Department, unless otherwise permitted by law.
